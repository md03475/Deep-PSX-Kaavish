State Bank issues regulations for payment card security

To promote modern and robust payment systems through enhancing security of payment
cards and safeguard the interests of consumers, State Bank of Pakistan has issued
Regulations for Payment Card Security under Payment Systems and Electronic Fund Transfers
Act, 2007.

These Regulations outline minimum set of operational, administrative, technical and physical
safeguards to secure Payment Card operations of the Financial Institutions (Fls) and Payment
Systems Operators (PSOs) & Payment Service Providers (PSOs) in Pakistan and are based on
international best practices and standards.

According to these regulations, Card Service Providers shall develop and implement a
comprehensive Card Security Framework by taking into consideration various types of risks
associated with the Payment Cards, their usage patterns and the cardholder profile. The
regulations also mandate the adoption of Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV) standard in
Pakistan thus bringing the country at par with other developed nations who have adopted
this international standard.

These regulations have been issued to facilitate the Card Service Providers to develop a Card
Security Framework while aligning their information security objectives with SBP’s strategic
objectives.

It may be noted that the stability of financial system is derived from the safety,
competitiveness and efficiency of the payment channels and corresponding instruments. The
use of electronic means of transactions has facilitated the masses in affecting transactions
instantly. With the increased growth in Payment Card transactions, its security has gained
importance due to rising threats and vulnerabilities associated with it. Therefore, SBP has
focused on enhancing the security and safety of all payment channels in the country.

RCG Asia meeting--Governor SBP for effective
implementation of Macroprudential Policy Framework

Governor State Bank of Pakistan(SBP) Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra emphasized on the need for
implementing the macroprudential policy framework in line with international best practices to limit
systemic risk facing the financial system during the meeting of Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional
Consultative Group Asia (RCG Asia). Governor Wathra, while sharing his views on macroprudential
policy(MPP) and tools, highlighted that the MPP needs to be complemented by appropriate
monetary, fiscal and other financial sector policies.

Governor, Wathra was co-chairing the 11 meeting of FSB RCG-Asia alongside Mr. Norman T.L. Chan
Chief Executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The meeting was held in Hong Kong SAR today on
December 2, 2016. In July 2015, Governor Wathra was appointed as the co-chair of FSB-RCG Asia
along with Mr. Norman T.L. Chan for a two-year term. The co-chairs are responsible for hosting RCG
Asia meetings, conducting workshops, coordinating with the FSB Secretariat, and attending FSB
Plenary meetings.

FSB has been established to coordinate, at the international level, the work of national financial
authorities and international standard setting bodies and to develop and promote the
implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest
of financial stability. In addition to its own member countries, FSB, through six regional consultative
groups (RCGs), conducts outreach with around 65 other non-FSB member jurisdictions. Formed in
2011, the RCG Asia includes central banks and financial authorities of 16 jurisdictions including
Australia, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

The meeting also discussed vulnerabilities and financial stability issues covering high levels of US
dollar denominated private sector debt levels, movement in exchange rates and changes in US
monetary policy stance, and their potential implications for the region.

During the session on managing non-performing loans (NPLs), members shared their experiences how
financial institutions in Asia are identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling NPLs, and what
legal, regulatory or other hurdles impede their resolution. As part of this discussion, Mr. Jameel
Ahmed, Executive Director Banking Supervision Group, SBP briefed the participants on the Basel
Committee’s consultative document “Prudential treatment of problem assets - definitions of non-
performing exposures and forbearance”, in addition to sharing Pakistan’s experience in managing
problem loans.

The meeting also considered the impact of financial technology on retail payments systems, where
members discussed how the proliferation of fintech is improving accessibility and convenience in
retail payments, while highlighting increases in credit and operational risk. The members
contemplated appropriate regulatory approaches to foster sound and secure retail payment systems
while striking a balance between financial inclusion, customer convenience and financial stability.

SBP Abolished the Fee on Payment of Government Taxes through ADCs and OTC

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has announced to abolish the fee on payment of government taxes
and duties through Alternate Delivery Channels (ADCs) and Over-the-Counter (OTC) from January 1,
2020. Presently, the taxpayers pay Rs.10 to Rs.50 per transaction for payment of taxes through ADCs
depending on the amount of tax paid, and Rs.50 per transaction for the payments through OTC. This
fee will be borne by SBP instead of taxpayers from January 1, 2020. The change has been notified
through SBP FD Circular No.4 of 2019 dated December 27, 2019.

The decision is part of SBP efforts to promote digital payments and is likely to attract larger number
of taxpayers towards digital payment of government taxes and duties. The mechanism for online
collection of taxes and duties was introduced in March 2018 in collaboration with Federal Board of
revenue (FBR) with the primary objective of taxpayers’ facilitation. The tax payers can pay their taxes
from the convenience of their homes or offices using internet/mobile banking facilities, through
14000 plus ATMs or any of the 15000 plus branches of commercial banks across the country. So far
Rs.346 billion has been collected through this mechanism. The collections through the ADCs/OTC
modes are likely to grow exponentially as the awareness about the mechanism improves.

SBP is also running an awareness campaign to familiarize the taxpayers, tax bar associations,
chambers of commerce, clearing and forwarding agents and business community at large about the
ADC and OTC payment mechanisms. Seminars and awareness sessions are being arranged across the
country through the field offices of SBP Banking Services Corporation. The first such seminar was held
in Karachi on December 26, 2019, which was attended by corporate taxpayers, representatives from
chamber of commerce, trade associations, commercial banks, tax bars and audit firms. The
participants appreciated SBP efforts for promotion of digital payments and said that such sessions are
critically important for enhancing public awareness and allaying their fears and apprehensions about
digital payments.

Influential Euromoney confers award of Central Bank Governor of the year 2016 to Governor
State Bank Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra

 

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood joined the prestigious club of distinguished
central bankers as he was named Euromoney’s Central Bank Governor of the Year 2016 at a reception
at the Press Club in Washington DC on October 7, 2016 on the sidelines of annual IMF/World Bank
meetings.

Governor Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra who rose to the position of Governor on April 29, 2014 carries
more than 35 years of extensive experience of commercial, corporate and investment banking
experience to his assignment.

“Since Wathra become Governor of the SBP in 2014, Pakistan has been one of the best performing
countries in the Euromoney Country Risk rankings, a sovereign rating service that asks independent
economists and analysts to measure risk factors, with sharp improvements in its overall, economic and
political scores,” says the Euromoney press release issued on this occasion.

Speaking at the ceremony the Governor remarked, “It is indeed a moment of pride for me as well as for
Pakistan that I have been awarded the central bank Governor of the year 2016. In fact, this is
recognition of all the teamwork that has lead to the successful reemergence of Pakistan as a safe and
stable country with a promising future. Here, I would specifically mention my colleagues at SBP
without whose support I would not have been able to deliver what I am being appreciated for. I am sure
that the appreciation of Euromoney will further boost the confidence of international investors.”

Besides extolling the significant role played by Mr. Wathra for financial inclusion in Pakistan, the
influential Euromoney magazine in its press release also acknowledged the role of Mr. Wathra for
bringing stability to Pakistan’s currency; successfully completing an IMF program; helping to improve
country’s economy from a period of stabilisation to an era of potential growth; bringing significant
changes to governance; reducing direct government financing from the central bank; boosting the
country’s capital markets; and bringing confidence about Pakistan’s future both domestically and
internationally.

SBP revises Prudential Requlations for agriculture financing

With a view to enhance access of formal financing to the farming community and to bring
regulatory framework for farmers’ financing in line with the changing business environment,
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued revised Prudential Regulations (PRs) for Agriculture
Financing.

The revised instructions call upon banks to develop robust and market-oriented policies and
practices to promote enhanced flow of credit to the agriculture sector without compromising
financial stability and banks’ risk management.

The revised regulations, among other areas, make it mandatory for banks to formulate
comprehensive agri. financing policies covering broad areas of strategic importance including
loan administration, disbursement & monitoring mechanisms, set-up and maintenance of
dedicated agri. finance departments equipped with qualified agri. financing experts and
delegation of powers relating to loan approval or sanction at appropriate level. Further, to
strengthen credit discipline and prudent lending practices by minimizing information
asymmetries, CIB report for all agri. loans has been mandatory. To facilitate farming community
in repayment of crop production loans under Revolving Credit Scheme on the basis of their
cropping cycle, banks are now required to segregate the repayment in two stages of at least
50% of the utilized credit during the year after harvest of each rabi and kharif crop.

PRs also cover Islamic Agriculture financing which will encourage banks to develop and launch
products to meet the financing needs of the farming community under Shariah Compliant
modes.

Revisions in these regulations have been made in consultations with stakeholders and
encompass prudent practices for banks financing various activities within agri. value chain and
come into force with immediate effect.

“SBP issues guidelines on Value Chain financing to help
Banks increase agri-financing outreach”

State Bank of Pakistan has issued Guidelines on Value Chain Contract Farmer Financing to encourage
banks to extend credit to small and marginalized farmers by leveraging on the strengths of inter-
relationships that exist in the agriculture value chain. These guidelines will serve as a basis for banks to
develop mutually beneficial relationship between the banks, farmers and the value-chain agent.

Contract Farming assumes an extensive number of arrangements along the value chain linking small-
scale farmers to markets by either formal or informal contracts. Value Chain Contract Farmer Financing
schemes are broadly defined as binding arrangements between banks and agri. value chain actors
including producers, processors, aggregators, traders through which a farmer or group of farmers
ensures supply of agricultural products to individual firms. It replaces the traditional collateral
requirements with trade agreements by facilitating coordinated commercial relations between value
chain actors.

The introduction of value chain contract farmer financing scheme will enable farmers to avail financing
from banks backed by processor’s guarantee and in return buyers/processors may get assurance of
getting required quantity and quality of agricultural produce. The guidelines have introduced five
instruments including Trader Credit, Input Supplier Credit, Marketing Company Credit, Lead Firm Credit
and Arthi or Intermediary, besides identifying roles & responsibilities of stakeholders, financing
mechanism, eligibility criteria, types of financing, loan limits, security & collateral, insurance and loan
monitoring mechanism.

It is expected that the guideline would benefit farmers in terms of enhanced productivity in variety of
ways such as availing quality input facilities, adopting new technologies, insurance coverage for
crop/non-crop activities and most importantly assurance of buyer in advance. The processors, traders,
exporters and Artis gains ensured supply of desired quantity of quality produce and bankers are at ease
with assured loan settlement by the VC agents.

Small farmers with up to 5 acre land holding constitute 65% or 5.4 million as against 8.3 million farm
households in the country. Therefore, SBP, in line with government’s efforts to promote access to
finance to small farmers, is working on a number of initiatives that include credit guarantee scheme for
small & marginalized farmers, crop & livestock insurance and warehouse receipt financing.

These guidelines are headway into SBP’s consistent efforts to improve small farmers’ access to finance
to achieve the broader goal of financial inclusion. SBP has advised banks to use the guidelines for
developing their own products for providing credit to contract farmers particularly to those who lack
collateral to offer to the bank. Successful adoption of the guidelines will improve depth and spectrum of
agri-financing to escalate rural household incomes and economic growth of the country. The Circular No.
for these guidelines is AC&MFD Circular No.5 of 2014 dated September 30, 2014. The Guideline and
Circular may be accessed from SBP website

State Bank asks banks to ensure continuous
ATMs service during Ramazan and Eid holidays

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has advised all banks to meticulously comply with its
guidelines and instructions regarding management of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
operations in order to ensure continuous availability of ATM service during the Holy Month of
Ramazan and Eid-ul Fitr holidays.

Heavy penalties under the relevant laws would be imposed on those banks, which fail to
comply with the guidelines and instructions regarding management of ATM operations and
monitoring of ATM cash/downtime during Ramazan and Eid holidays issued by the State Bank
from time to time.

SBP has also decided to depute special inspection teams to carry out surprise
inspections of ATMs installed at various cities/towns throughout the country to ascertain the
compliance level of its instructions and guidelines by banks, says PSD Circular Letter No. 03 of
August 15, 2011.

According to the SBP Guidelines/Instructions, banks are required to take all steps to
ensure continued availability of ATM services. They are also bound to ensure that ATMs shall be
continuously replenished on regular intervals during Eid holidays.

Banks had already been advised by SBP to make adequate back-up arrangements to
ensure availability of ATM service round the clock and put in place comprehensive operating
procedures to timely resolve the cases of out of cash, breakdown of ATMs, Systems and
Network.

SBP had also asked the banks to deploy appropriate staff to address problems that may
cause ATM malfunctioning or cash outage incidents, besides introducing a 24/7 helpline to
resolve the day-to-day operational issues at ATMs. The helpline should also be accessible
through special phone terminals placed inside all ATM booths/cabins. Banks are required to
ensure that these phones are in working order. The helpline numbers should also be widely
publicized for the customers’ awareness so that they may inquire or timely register their
complaints as per their convenience.

Complaints regarding non-functioning of ATMs may be lodged with Consumer
Protection Department, State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi at its email: cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk

or fax no.92-21-99218160.

SBP Governor stresses the need for
development of capital markets

Syed Salim Raza, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed the need for the development of
capital markets, especially the bond and money markets in the country.

Addressing a luncheon meeting of the INSEAD Alumni Association of Pakistan at a local club in
Karachi, he said the risks caused by slowdown in globalization can effectively be overcome by promoting
national interests. ‘The Emerging Markets (EMs) will need to look at developing their own internal and
regional markets,’ Mr Raza added.

“Pakistan with others EMs could look at ways to galvanized intra-regional trade on a financial
next settlement basis to reduce money caught up in the chamber of trade — the Chiang Mai initiative is
an example of a significance start to promoting inter — regional trade liquidity,” the Governor added.

In view of the current global economic crisis, the SBP Governor said: “we have been less
affected than most of the EMs as our banks are squarely domestically based for asset and liabilities and
well-capitalized. Our exports were limited to 13% of GNP as against well over 30% for most of the larger
Asian economies while our imports will come down from 40 to 32% from both price and volume
effects.”

He observed that with inflation coming under control and a huge domestic market, we could
very usefully produce more for the domestic economy and take the opportunity to develop domestic
commerce and domestic brands.

The SBP Governor also spoke about the changes in economic ideology over the years and drew
on examples from Europe, Asia and the United States of America. He also spoke at length about Banking
spreads, SME development and remittances in response to questions raised by the alumni present at
the lunch.

It may be pointed out INSEAD is one of the world’s leading and largest business schools with
campuses in Europe (Fontainebleau) and Asia (Singapore) and two centres in the Middle East. Over
1,000 MBA and PhD candidates and over 9,500 executive education candidates attend its courses during
an academic year. Set up in 1957, it has today over 38,000 alumni in 150 countries around the world.
The Pakistan chapter was set up in 2008 by its Founder President Ms Sadia Khan.

DR. ISHRAT HUSAIN RECEIVES THE CENTRAL BANK
GOVERNOR OF THE YEAR AWARD.

The Editor-in-Chief of The Banker magazine, Mr. Stephen Timewell presented the
Central Bank Governor of the Year in Asia 2005 Award to the State Bank Governor,
Dr. Ishrat Husain at a simple but impressive ceremony held at a local hotel in Karachi
today. This is for the first time in the history of Pakistan that any Governor of the State
Bank has received this prestigious award.

The ceremony was attended, among others, by the Chairman, Securities &
Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Dr. Tariq Hassan, Deputy Governors, State Bank of
Pakistan, Mr. Tawfiq A. Husain and Mr. Mansur-ur-Rehman Khan and Chief Executives of
commercial banks.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Timewell paid glowing tributes to the Governor,
Dr. Ishrat Husain. He said the reforms and restructuring of Pakistan’s financial sector
under the dynamic leadership of Dr. Ishrat Husain have resulted in a more resilient and
efficient financial system. He said that the State Bank has progressively improved its
capacity to manage and maintain macroeconomic stability. He said that Pakistan’s financial
sector is now more competitive and relatively efficient. The financial infrastructure has
strengthened and the regulatory and supervisory functions of the SBP under the leadership
of the Governor have significantly improved, he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Ishrat Husain said that it was not an honour for him
but for the country also which now have an efficient financial system. He said the banking
sector reforms have brought in competition within the system, improved internal efficiency,
reduced the lending rates significantly and broadened access to the middle class. He
emphasized that these reforms would not have been possible without the leadership, active
support and guidance of the President, General Pervez Musharraf. He said the banking
sector reforms could not have been materialized without the cooperation of the chief
executives of banks. He also thanked The Banker magazine for bestowing this prestigious
award to him. He said that by continuation of the financial sector reforms, the country
would be able to reduce poverty significantly in the years ahead.

The Banker magazine of London is a subsidiary of the Financial Times.

SBP issues guidelines for Development Finance Institutions to
undertake Shariah compliant business

 

 

To enlarge the scope of Shariah compliant financial services in the country, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
has taken another important step by issuing guidelines for Development Finance Institutions (DFls) to
undertake Shariah compliant businesses and operations. Further, keeping in view the various
developments, such as changes in the licensing and regulatory regime for banks, SBP has also updated the
guidelines, introduced in 2004, for establishing Islamic banking Institutions.

The updated guidelines deal with the establishment of a full-fledged Islamic bank, Islamic banking
subsidiary and Islamic banking branches of conventional banks. In addition, these guidelines cover
different areas including minimum capital adequacy, requirements related to sponsor directors,
business plan, Shariah governance, application fees, preconditions for commencement of
business. For details: https://www.sbp.org.pk/ibd/2020/C4.htm

 

The guidelines for conventional banks and DFls to undertake Shariah compliant business and operations
also cover the eligibility criteria for in-principle approval, proposal requirements, shariah governance,
minimum capital requirement and systems and controls. Further, separation of Islamic banking/finance
division and its different components, responsibilities of head of the Islamic banking/ finance division and
requirements for commencement of operations are part of these guidelines.

It is expected that these guidelines will facilitate the new entrants in the field of Islamic banking through
establishment of full-fledged Islamic banks, Islamic banking subsidiaries by conventional banks and the
commencement of Shariah compliant business and operations by conventional banks and DFls.

State Bank Clarifies Authenticity of Rs 500 Banknotes without OVI

Apropos the news circulating in some sections of social media regarding authenticity of Rs 500
banknotes without OVI flag, it may be recalled that the State Bank had introduced new design
banknotes of Rs 500 in 2006. These banknotes carry state of the art security features, besides, change
in size, design and color scheme. Later on another security feature, the color shifting flag made of
Optical Variable Ink (OVI) was added to enhance the anti-counterfeiting resilience and ease in
identification by the general public. This, however, resulted in availability of both types of Rs 500
banknotes viz issued during 2006-2009 without OVI, and issued w.e.f January 25, 2010 with OVI

feature.

It is, therefore, clarified for benefit of all concerned that new design banknotes of Rs 500, with and
without OVI flag, are genuine provided all other security features are intact. General public is
encouraged to learn more about the security features in Pakistani banknotes through section in SBP
website titled “Rupay ko Pehchano” (http://www.sbp.org.pk/finance/NotePehchano/index.asp). SBP
also expects that general public may discard any such news appearing in social media and discourage

the circulation of this unauthenticated news.

SBP gives mandatory targets to banks to increase housing & construction
financing to at least 5% of private sector credit by December 2021

To promote housing and construction of buildings activities in the country, as envisaged by the
Government of Pakistan (GoP), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to set a mandatory target for
banks to extend mortgage loans and financing for developers and builders. Banks will be required to
increase their housing and construction of building loan portfolios to at least 5 percent of their private
sector credit by the end of December 2021.

Due to significant shortages in meeting the annual additional demand of housing facilities by its citizens,
a huge shortfall of housing units has accumulated over the years in the country. Filling this gap is
important to improve quality of living conditions for common people and construction of housing with
linkages to dozens of allied industries offers substantial potential for boosting economic activities in
the country. This, however, requires considerable amount of financing to meet the investment needs
of this sector. In Pakistan, bank financing for mortgages and housing construction is less than one
percent of GDP which is one of the lowest in the region. Banks have remained reluctant over the years
to extend mortgage financing for various reasons. Keeping in view the need for housing and its
contribution to the economy, GoP is aiming to increase the number of housing units manifold in the
coming years and has recently announced several measures including commitment to remove hurdles
in mortgage and construction financing.

To play its due role in enhancing financing to the housing and construction of building activities, SBP is
also taking several measures in consultation with key stakeholders. A high level Steering Committee,
under the Chairmanship of Governor SBP and with representation from Chairman NAPHDA (Naya
Pakistan Housing Development Authority), several bank Presidents and other stakeholders, is meeting
every week to resolve issues and follow up on decisions to promote mortgage and construction
financing, especially for NAPHDA projects. The Steering Committee has five sub-committees dedicated
for various work streams with multiple operational level groups working at a fast pace.

In today’s announcement, while issuing mandatory targets, banks have been asked to gear up
appropriately by developing their infrastructure and capacity to meet these targets. SBP has instructed
banks to present a concrete action plan to SBP, within 15 working days, containing quarterly targets,
development of products, media campaigns, development of technology infrastructure, and capacity
building of staff, amongst other areas. Banks have also been directed to report data of approvals and
disbursements against the targets on monthly basis starting from September 2020. For details:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C10.htm

SBP believes that several measures on the part of government will support bank financing for housing
and construction related sectors. These include passage of an efficient foreclosure law and its effective
implementation, automation and computerization of land and property records for facilitation of clean
title for bank lending and reduction in time taken in registration of title & creation/perfection of
mortgages, creation of a Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to address bank concerns of ensuring
adequate standards of developers and builders, and reduction in transaction cost related to property
transfers.

SBP Issues Framework for Risk Management
in Outsourcing Arrangement by Financial Institutions

 

State Bank of Pakistan has revised the ‘Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements’ with the
objective to enable Financial Institutions (Fls) including Banks, Microfinance Banks and
Development Finance Institutions to effectively manage the potential risks associated with
outsourcing arrangements. The revised instructions are termed as “Framework for Risk
Management in Outsourcing Arrangement by Financial Institutions”.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) earlier introduced the Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements for
banks/DFls in 2007. The Guidelines were issued in view of the increasing use of outsourcing of
services by banks/DFls and potential impact of associated risks and obligations to customers.

The framework is based on international standards and best practices on the subject. These
instructions aim to enhance the proactive environment in Fls on various aspects of the
outsourcing including but not limited to governance, risk management, insourcing of services,
group outsourcing, outsourcing of foreign branches of banks, information technology
outsourcing and collaboration/outsourcing arrangements by Fls with Fintechs (Financial
Technologies). Besides, the Framework also encompasses the list of critical functions/activities
that cannot be performed by employees of the 3rd party service providers.

All new outsourcing arrangements by Fls shall be governed under this framework. The Fls, while
deciding to outsource any function, activity or process, shall ensure that outsourcing neither
effects the protection available to depositors or investors under the existing legal framework
nor the same shall be used to avoid compliance with the regulatory requirements. The Fls are
required to ensure that their existing outsourcing arrangements would be aligned with this
framework latest by June 30, 2018.

Asaan Remittance Account

In line with its efforts to enhance outreach of basic financial services to unbanked or underserved
segment of the population, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in collaboration with Pakistan
Remittance Initiative (PRI) has launched ‘Asaan Remittance Account’ to be opened by banks with
simplified procedures.

The objective of this initiative is to encourage opening of these accounts for receiving home
remittances through proper accounts instead of traditional cash over the counter transactions. This
category of limited mandate accounts is designed for beneficiaries of home remittances and will be
fed with the proceeds of home remittances only. The prospective recipients and their family
members (beneficiaries of home remittances) can open these accounts at banks branches or by
bank’s permanent staff/ employee after visiting customers’ places.

Only Individuals can open these accounts with a simple and one page account opening form (paper
based/ electronic form) in Pak Rupee with basic customer information. The customer due
diligence and other controls specified for ‘Asaan Account’ that was earlier launched by SBP in
2015 shall be applicable for opening of Asaan Remittance Account. In addition, the account
opening form should have International Bank Account Number (IBAN) of the Asaan Remittance
Account and names of prospective remitter(s) stating relationship with the account holder as well.
A maximum credit balance limit of Rs. 2.0 million, cash withdrawal limit of Rs. 50,000 per day
and fund transfer limit of Rs. 50,000 per day has been set for these accounts.

We expect that this facility will help to achieve financial inclusion targets set out under National
Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) and provide standard framework governing the limited

mandate accounts and products currently being offered by commercial banks and microfinance
banks. Over and above, general public will get benefit of banks accounts and allied facilities.

State Bank further facilitates freelancers and pensioners

In order to broaden the scope of business to customer transactions through home remittance
channel, the State Bank of Pakistan has enhanced payment limits against freelance services from USS
1500 per individual per month to USS 5000 per individual per month. The enhancement is mainly
aimed at further facilitating freelancers by allowing them to route their funds through the economical
and efficient channel of home remittances rather than keeping their funds with various online money

transfer companies. It would also help in diverting foreign exchange flows from informal to formal
channels.

Moreover, the transaction limit for pension receipts has been revised to USS 2500 per individual per
month.

State Bank committed to protect
interest of banks’ customers

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has once again reminded
all commercial banks to adopt fair practices and to make complete disclosure of the
lending and deposit rates of all consumer products offered by them and to clarify the
pricing structure of the loan in the their respective loan agreements with their
customers.

It may be pointed out that the existing instructions of the State Bank require
banks to get the schedule of charges printed and make the same available to their
customers at all branches at least seven days before the commencement of the half
year. The banks are also required to make available their schedule of charges on
their websites. Similarly, locker-holder issue has also been taken care of by
prescribing the insurance ceiling as per the size of the locker. Only recently, the SBP
advised all banks to pay a minimum of 5% profit to all depositors regardless of their
account balances.

All these instructions and other measures taken by the State Bank from time
to time are manifestation of SBP’s resolve to protect the interest of banks’
customers. The State Bank has also taken a number of steps to ensure that
consumers have access to accurate information, fair credit billing and reporting, fair
debt collection practices etc. Most of these issues will be further addressed as SBP is
processing “Consumer Protection Act” and issuance of “Fair Debt Collection
Guidelines” in the near future; former would need to be considered by the
Government / legislature.

Complaints by certain quarters that banks charge very high mark-up rates on
credit cards products need to be seen in the proper context. Credit Cards are not a
debt instrument and the banks allow Credit facility free of mark-up/interest to their
Card holders for the period around 30 to 45 days or as specified in their terms and
conditions accepted by card holders. The card holders may make purchases and can
make payments within the stipulated period without any financial charges. One of
the features of Credit Card is withdrawal of cash. Any liberty available to the card
holder to pay the amount in toto without any mark-up or extra charges is not meant
for cash withdrawals. Further, the high mark-up rate on credit cards can be
attributed to high cost associated with their marketing, recovery, administration and
fund utilization. The same scenario exists internationally.

In addition to establishment of the Office of the Banking Mohtasib, the SBP
has established a full-fledged Consumer Protection Department to effectively resolve
consumer’s complaints against banks. The State Bank has already addressed the
issue of early disposal of the complaints by directing the banks/DFls to provide
redressal within a period of 10 working days. However, in any case, the final reply
may be sent within a period not exceeding 45 working days, barring cases where
reasonable grounds exist on record for not complying within the prescribed time
period.

Tax regime for non-residents simplified to encourage
investment in long-term debt securities

Amendments in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 have been issued to simplify the tax regime for non-
resident companies investing in debt instruments and Government securities. These amendments
aim to deepen our capital markets, support availability of long term rupee financing sources, support
competition in the local currency debt market, and diversify the source of funding for the
government.

The existing foreign exchange framework allows non-residents to invest in debt instruments and
Government securities through Special Convertible Rupee Account (SCRA) maintained with banks in
Pakistan. However, the tax structure for non-residents investing in debt securities was historically
complex. Different rates applicable for the withholding tax on profit on debt and capital gains tax,
penal transaction charges for non-filers, a complex tax-filing process and uncertainty about tax
applicability were the key impediments to foreign investment into the local debt market, particularly
in the long-term debt instruments. In this context, the recent amendment in the tax laws has
simplified Pakistan’s tax regime for investment in the local debt market.

Specifically, the above Ordinance has implemented the following changes in Income Tax Ordinance,
2001 to simplify the tax regime for non-resident companies, having no permanent establishment in
Pakistan, investing through SCRA in debt instruments and government securities (including Treasury
Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds):

1. The capital gains tax shall be subject to withholding at the rate of ten percent and shall constitute
final discharge of the tax liability;

2. No deduction of 0.6% banking transaction tax under section 236P on transactions in SCRA;
3. No advance tax payment under section 147 on capital gains;

4. Dispensation from the requirement of registration under section 181, filing of return under
section 114 and filing of statement of final taxation under section 115 in respect of income solely
from capital gains or profit on debt from investment in debt securities;

5. No distinction shall be made in terms of filer or non-filer;

Many non-resident investors currently benefit from tax treaties and already enjoy reduced rates of
taxation around 10 percent. The key provision in the ordinance is to simplify the tax structure and
process for international investors.

The above amendments will help to deepen the capital market, generate greater interest in the
longer-dated government securities, diversify the investor base, and reduce the cost of debt for the
government.

SBP CENTRAL BOARD APPRECIATES BANK’S MANAGEMENT
FOR INDUCTING YOUTHS FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED REGIONS.

The Central Board of Directors of State Bank of Pakistan in its meeting held
on 21* February, 2005 at Islamabad appreciated the Bank management’s efforts to
facilitate induction of youth from relatively under-represented regions/provinces like
AJK, Balochistan, FATA and rural Sindh in the State Bank.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Ishrat Husain informed the Board
that the recruitment in the Bank against all regular positions has been conducted in
accordance with the prescribed merit/provincial and regional quotas. However, due to
under-representation of incumbents from certain regions/provinces in the State Bank,
it was decided to induct a special batch of SBOTS (State Bank’s Officers Training
Scheme) for the youth from AJK, Balochistan, FATA and rural Sindh.

He informed the Board that recruitment/selection of this special batch of
SBOTS has been finalized and forty-four candidates have been short-listed for
selection as Officers Grade-II in the State Bank.

He also informed the Board that in order to encourage the youths from the
under-represented provinces/regions, the State Bank for the past couple of years has
been providing special internship programmes for the students of various educational
institutions/universities from Balochistan and rural Sindh.

Additionally, the SBP also offers attachments and fellowship opportunities for
Economic and Business Management Faculty Members of Universities from all over
the country. The Governor emphasized the need for the faculty members of
educational institutions from rural Sindh and Balochistan to avail these opportunities
to enable them to improve the quality of the education being imparted by them. This,
in turn, will help to enhance the capabilities of the graduates from these institutions to
compete with graduates from other universities in the country.

The Governor further added that as a national institution the SBP is conscious
of its responsibilities towards providing employment opportunities for the youth of all
provinces and regions in Pakistan. It will continue to cater these needs within the
ambit of its resources/capabilities.

State Bank asks banks to submit new prudential
returns for effective monitoring of all kinds of risks

The Stat Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a set of prudential returns/statements for banks
to enable it to effectively monitor and assess the risks posed by their relationship with the associated
undertakings.

The new prudential returns/ statements introduced for all banks incorporated in Pakistan
include (A) Details of related parties; (B) Details of exposures to and from related parties; (C) Details of
related party dealings and transactions; (D) Details of equity exposures; (E) Details of capital adequacy of
subsidiaries; and (F) Latest available financial statements of subsidiaries and associates (as defined in the
IAS-28).

SBP has advised all banks incorporated in Pakistan to submit these returns/statements on half
yearly basis, effective from half year ending June 30, 2012 and onward. These returns should reach the
Banking Surveillance Department of the SBP within 45 days of the close of each half year ending June 30
and December 31. However, banks may submit the returns for half-year ending June 30, 2012 within 45
days from the date of BSD Circular 2 i.e. September 13, 2012.

It may be pointed out that in addition to the risks that banks generally carry on their books, they
are also exposed to risks arising out of their relationship with associated undertakings. One of the Core
Principles of Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also
necessitates consolidated supervision of banks, covering all risks, whether they are carried on their own
books or on the books of associates. It is, therefore, imperative to monitor and assess the risks posed by

such relationships.

Banks/DFIs should adopt sustainable banking
practices: Mr. Saeed Ahmad, Deputy Governor, SBP

Mr. Saeed Ahmad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan chaired the meeting to
initiate Baseline Survey on Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) in
Pakistan being conducted by International Finance Corporation in collaboration with
State Bank of Pakistan.

The Deputy Governor emphasized that environmental and social parameters are
significant sources of credit, liability and/or reputational risks and may seriously affect
economic performance and long term sustainability of a financial institution, if not
properly & timely managed. He further said that green and sustainable banking may
support Government in its efforts to overcome current electricity shortfall and help
increase economic productivity.

The ESRM Survey is being conducted in 17 countries. State Bank has partnered with IFC
for completion of survey in Pakistan. The results of the survey will provide insights to
State Bank for streamlining its regulatory and developmental initiatives for encouraging
incorporation of environmental and social considerations in banking practices and
products.

The Deputy Governor informed the participants that State Bank has taken up green and
sustainable banking as a special developmental area for promotion of environment and
social considerations in the banking practices. This is in line with the adoption of
sustainable banking practices in other central banks in the region and globally.

He further informed that State Bank has recently joined Sustainable Banking Network -
an informal association of regulators established by IFC for knowledge exchange and
learning on sustainable banking. He said that State Bank is also exploring the possibility
of issuing green banking guidelines including environmental risk management practices
for the banks/ DFIs.

The Deputy Governor recalled and appreciated the Environmental and Social Risk
Management Guidelines prepared by Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) in 2010 and
emphasized that Banks/DFIs may build on its initial spadework to develop their Internal
ESRM Systems and adopt sustainable banking practices.

He further remarked that State Bank has also taken a number of initiatives for promotion
of infrastructure financing of banks and reiterated commitment of State Bank to provide
necessary support for promotion of green banking. He apprised the participants that

Governor SBP encourages stakeholders to strengthen the quantity and quality of credit to
Pakistan’s agriculture sector

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, appreciated the banks for their efforts in
increasing the bank credit to the agriculture sector, which reached its historical high by end of
FY19. ‘It is for the first time in Pakistan’s history that credit to the agriculture sector has
surpassed one trillion rupees,’ said the Governor in his keynote address. He was chairing the
annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held in Peshawar, KPK
as part of SBPs continued efforts to enhance agriculture credit in the underserved provinces
and regions.

Dr. Baqir, however, urged the banks to enhance their efforts to achieve qualitative aspects of
the assigned targets as well in line with the strategic shift and key policy actions taken by SBP
regarding agricultural financing. He highlighted that most of the banks met their assigned
targets except for some of the banks including ZTBL, PPCBL, some of the domestic private
banks and Islamic banks falling short of achieving their targets. The province wise agriculture
credit disbursement witnessed double-digit growth across all provinces and regions; however,
banks struggled to achieve their assigned targets in the underserved regions. He urged
agriculture lending banks and institutions to scale up their efforts and commitment to ensure
achievement of agriculture credit target in the underserved provinces and regions.

The Governor apprised the committee that SBP is considering three policy actions to further
promote financial inclusion in the agriculture sector. First, enhancing transparency through
disclosure of bank wise performance statistics on monthly basis covering agriculture credit
disbursement, geographic distribution, outstanding amount, number of borrowers, and
agriculture credit infrastructure. Second, introducing a comprehensive scoring model for
ranking of banks against key agriculture credit indicators and targets. Third, introducing
incentives and penalties based on performance scores of banks. Dr. Bagir emphasized that
there is a large scope for lending opportunities for banks that support both financial inclusion
and banks’ profitability.

The keynote address was followed by a presentation wherein the performance of banks on
agricultural financing was reviewed against their targets during FY19. While assigning the
agriculture credit target for FY20, it was shared that the overall disbursement target of
Rs.1,350 billion has been assigned to banks which is 89% of the total estimated agriculture
credit requirement of Rs.1,518 billion. The province wise and sector wise distribution of the
target was adopted while considering the provincial agricultural credit requirements, banks’
overall lending capacity and their business expansion plans. It was highlighted that Islamic
banks and Islamic branches of commercial banks have been assigned disbursement target of
Rs.110 billion in line with previous year to help realize the potential of Islamic agriculture
financing. Further, the overall target of outstanding borrowers has been enhanced to 4.67
million with the addition of 650,000 new borrowers.

National Security and War Course participants visit State Bank

 

A delegation of National Security and War Course 2017 led by Maj. General Khalid Zia today
visited State Bank of Pakistan. The delegation consisted of more than hundred senior military
officials of Pakistan armed forces and 40 foreign countries to get themselves acquainted with
the working of the central bank. The course is being conducted at National Defence
University Islamabad.

Welcoming the delegation, Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra in
his keynote address stated that their study tour of State Bank of Pakistan will offer them an
insight into working of Pakistan’s central bank and how it is contributing to the financial
stability and overall well being of the people of the country.

The keynote address of the Governor traversed many themes. Governor explained that
besides carrying out traditional functions, SBP also performs non-traditional development
functions like broadening the access and usage of the financial system through promotion of
microfinance, SME finance, Islamic banking, agricultural finance. He went on to add that
over the past three years, key macroeconomic indicators have shown significant
improvement which bodes well for country’s economy.

The Governor also stated that a key reform instituted by SBP was the formulation of an
independent Monetary Policy Committee in FY16, thus making Pakistan the first major
country in South Asia to do so. The Governor stated that in terms of broadening access to
financial services, the implementation of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS)
championed by SBP continues with full vigor. The Governor also stated that the interests of
small depositors will also be safeguarded with the establishment of the Deposit Protection
Corporation as a subsidiary of SBP. Dr. Omar Farooq Saqib, Director, Monetary Policy
Department, State Bank of Pakistan delivered a detailed presentation on monetary policy
and other functions of State Bank of Pakistan.

In the end, Major-Gen Khalid Zia thanked the Governor for providing the opportunity of great
learning to the course participants.

Q2 CY14: Mobile Wallets reach 4.2 million

The number of mobile wallets has reached to 4.2 million by the end of the quarter April- June
2014, registering an increase of 11%. The mobile wallets are banking accounts which are being
opened largely by the previously unbanked population at their nearby shops which are working as
branchless banking agents.

Overall, number of Branchless banking (BB) transactions grew to 71.1 million valuing Rs 326.1 billion
during the quarter, 4% higher in volume and 17% higher in value in comparison to the previous quarter.
Average size of transaction stood at only Rs 4,581, according to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s latest
Branchless Banking Newsletter.

The volume and average size of BB transactions is a key indicator measuring access to finance by the
unbanked population in the country. The continuous growth of BB transactions reflects interest and
confidence of common man in this innovative banking service. Currently, eight BB players with country-
wide presence of easy-to-access service delivery channels are offering an array of services including bill
payments, money transfers, Government-to-persons (G2P) payments, loan repayments, and mobile top
ups.

The combined agent network of BB players has increased to 168,615 agents, registering 14% growth
over the last quarter. While recent growth in agent network is owed to agent-sharing arrangements
among the players, the number of distinct agents is estimated to be around 80,000.

According to the newsletter, G2P payments worth Rs 16.9 billion were disbursed via BB channels to 5.3
million beneficiaries during April- June 2014 quarter, higher than Rs 15.32 billion disbursed to 4.6 million
beneficiaries in the last quarter.

As a result of various initiatives taken by State Bank of Pakistan, branchless banking has been reaching
out to all geographic and economic segments of the country. SBP considers that branchless banking
would grow further and gradually become a significant part of overall retail banking landscape in
Pakistan.

The newsletter covers BB industry events, local and international news, and industry expert interview.
Importantly, the newsletter highlights the progress of an important SBP’s initiative to engage World Bank
for drafting a first-ever National Financial Inclusion Strategy for Pakistan.

State Bank announces Government of Pakistan’s markup subsidy for affordable
housing finance

In line with its vision of providing affordable housing to the masses, Government of Pakistan will be
providing a markup subsidy facility for the construction and purchase of new houses. This facility will
allow all individuals, who will be constructing or buying a new house for the first time, to avail bank’s
financing at subsidized and affordable markup rates. This facility will be provided with the administrative
support of State Bank of Pakistan as executing partner with Government of Pakistan and Naya Pakistan
Housing and Development Authority (NAPHDA).

Government of Pakistan has allocated Rs. 33 billion for payment of markup subsidy for financing over a
period of 10 years and has assured continuity of the facility. For this purpose, State Bank and
Government of Pakistan have signed a memorandum of understanding.

The markup subsidy facility will be available through all banks and is divided in three tiers:

Financing under Tier | is available for purchase of houses/apartments/flats of upto 5 marla or 125 sq.
yards, with maximum covered area of 850 sq. feet and maximum price of Rs. 3.5 million, under NAPHDA
projects. Maximum financing under this Tier is Rs. 2.7 million with maximum tenor of up to 20 years.
Banks will charge maximum markup rate of KIBOR plus 250 basis points. However, GOP will provide
markup subsidy to reduce borrowers’ rate to 5% for first five years and 7% for next five years. KIBOR is
the Karachi Interbank Offer Rate that is determined in the interbank market on a daily basis and is used
as a benchmark for most of the retail lending by banks. These rates are published on the website of
State Bank of Pakistan on a daily basis.

Financing under Tier II is also for houses/apartments/flats upto 5 marla or 125 sq. yards with maximum
covered area of 850 sq. feet and maximum price of Rs 3.5 million. Maximum financing under this Tier is
Rs 3 million with maximum tenor of up to 20 years. This Tier facilitates construction or purchase of
housing units by individuals and households who have not applied or qualified for NAPHDA projects.
Banks will charge maximum markup rate of KIBOR plus 400 basis points. However, subsidized rate for
the borrowers for first 10 years under Tier 2 is the same as that of Tier I.

The Tier Ill of the facility promotes affordable housing for middle-income families. This Tier allows
subsidized financing for construction or purchase of houses/apartments/flats of more than 5 marla (125
sq. yards) and upto 10 marla (250 sq. yards) with maximum covered area from 850 sq. feet to 1,100 sq.
feet and maximum price of Rs 6 million. Maximum financing under this Tier is Rs. 5 million with
maximum tenor of up to 20 years. Banks will charge maximum markup rate of KIBOR plus 400 basis
points. However, GOP will provide markup subsidy to reduce borrowers’ rate to 7% for first five years
and 9% for next five years.

SBP allows import advance payment facility for manufacturers against LCs

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed banks to make advance payment up to 50 per cent of the
value of imports against letter of credit for manufacturing concerns. Using this facility, manufacturing
concerns will be able to import plant, machinery, spare parts and raw material etc. by making payment
in advance.

Earlier in July 2018, in light of the pressures in the foreign exchange market and deteriorating balance
of payments situation, SBP withdrew the advance payment facility allowed to importers. Subsequently,
some of the restrictions were relaxed to facilitate imports in critical areas related to medicines,
education and defense while most of the restrictions remained in place.

After the implementation of a market based exchange rate system in May 2019, pressures in the
foreign exchange market have eased and the balance of payments has witnessed significant
improvement as reflected in the improving current account balance, rising net foreign exchange
reserves, and other indicators. This improvement in the foreign exchange market after the
implementation of the exchange rate reforms has allowed to SBP to begin relaxing the restrictions that
had been imposed earlier. In November 2019, SBP allowed advance payment up to USD 10,000 per
invoice for import of raw materials and spare parts to manufacturing concerns for their own use only.
At that time SBP also eased restrictions on acquisition of services from abroad, such as consultancies.
The measure taken today will support the manufacturing sector by easing restrictions on import of
plant, machinery, spare parts and raw material, and related items. Today’s measure is in continuation
of SBP’s efforts to reverse the earlier restrictions and facilitate and support ease of doing business in
light of the improved foreign exchange and economic outlook.

The circular issued to banks with regards to the latest instructions is available at:

Kamran Shehzad urges Islamic banks to
diversify their investment portfolios

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed
upon the Islamic banks to diversify their investment portfolios by enhancing financing to Small and
Medium Enterprises (SMEs), agriculture, housing finance and microfinance sectors of the country.

Delivering his keynote address at a two-day World Islamic Finance Summit 2011 at a local
hotel in Karachi today, he said that Islamic banks can not only increase their depth and breadth but
also contribute to higher financial inclusion levels in the country by targeting these underserved
sectors of the economy as the share of these sectors in overall Islamic financing is very low despite
their significant contribution in Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

SBP Deputy Governor observed that the business model of current paradigm of Islamic
banking industry both at domestic and international level has a relatively lower mix of participatory
modes such as Musharka and Mudarba. ‘Moving closer to these modes will help Islamic banking
industry to bring in their fold clientele such as SME that has been ignored by conventional finance
industry because of its relatively high risk perception’, he added.

He noted with concern that the overall financing by Islamic banking industry in agriculture
remains below 3 percent. ‘A country like Pakistan where agriculture has the highest contribution in
domestic production, Islamic banks can increase their market share by reaching out this sector’, he
added.

Mr. Kamran Shehzad said that housing finance, particularly the low cost housing, is another
largely untapped area which the Islamic banks can venture by developing suitable products. Islamic
microfinance is also an important area where Islamic banks can serve people, who remain
unbanked due to their inability of meeting criteria of commercial banks, he observed.

He said that to encourage the industry to venture into participatory modes of financing,
State Bank has constituted a Task Force having representation of Islamic banks, business
community, academia and accounting professionals to develop an incentive framework for
promotion of such products. ‘This framework will be aimed at encouraging Islamic banks to offer
participatory modes while minimizing issues of moral hazard, adverse selection, information
asymmetries and trust deficit between Islamic banking institutions (IBls) and entrepreneurs,’ he
added.

He said that SBP has played a key role in facilitating Islamic banking industry to reach a point
of recognition both at the local and international level. State Bank while being a regulator, has also
remained committed to being a facilitator for the industry; it is one of the few regulators that have
introduced comprehensive legal, regulatory and Shariah compliance framework for Islamic banking
industry, he said. ‘Moreover, SBP has issued model agreements for encouraging standardization

Press Release on State Bank’s Business Confidence Survey (Telephonic)

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) regulates the monetary and credit system of Pakistan and fosters its
growth in the best national interest with a view to securing monetary stability and fuller utilisation of
the country’s productive resources. Like many other central banks, it weighs up the public and firms
perceptions about prevailing and expected economic condition, as an important part of its monetary
policy formulation process.

For this purpose, SBP is already conducting telephonic surveys of households (Consumer Confidence
Survey-CCS) that are selected randomly across the country. These surveys are conducted after every
two months and provide information on “what people are thinking” about the economy. The results
of CCS are available at SBP website (http://dsqx.sbp.org.pk/ccs/index.ph

Continuing with the spirit of seeking input from its main stakeholders, State Bank of Pakistan is now
planning to obtain opinion of firms about current and expected business conditions in the country.

The Business Confidence Survey (BCS) will be a telephonic survey lasting between 7 to 10 minutes
with a senior executive of participating firms requiring them to answer some quick questions. This
survey will be conducted all over the country in October 2017 and will be repeated periodically. All
the information collected through the survey will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be
shared with any other person or entity. Furthermore, it will not be used for any purpose other than
research on economic conditions. We are conducting this survey with the collaboration of Institute of
Business Administration, Karachi.

SBP encourages all firms operating in different areas and sectors to participate in this survey in the
best national interest.

In case of any queries/clarification, kindly contact at the following address:

Deputy Governor SBP lauds improvement in security conditions

and its positive impact on economic activities

Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Jameel Ahmad while appreciating the reviving economic
activities in the country has lauded the impact of improved security conditions, attributed much to
the operation Zarb-e-Azb, and the on-going operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. “A marked turnaround in retail
sales has been observed in metropolises, with positive readings in investor and consumer confidence
surveys,” said the Deputy Governor.

He was addressing to a delegation of National Security and War Course 2017 led by Air Commodore
Aamir Bashir that visited State Bank of Pakistan. The delegation consisted of more than 200 officers
including Pakistan Armed Forces officers, Grade 20 CSS officers and senior military officers from
friendly countries.

Deputy Governor SBP Jameel Ahmad further stated that their inland study tour of SBP will offer them
an insight into working of Pakistan's central bank and understanding of monetary policy issues. The
keynote address of the Deputy Governor traversed many themes. Deputy Governor explained that
being the central bank of a developing country, State Bank of Pakistan has also assigned for itself an
important developmental role. Given the socio-economic indicators of the country, coupled with low
level of financial inclusion, SBP has been aggressively promoting financing to under-served sectors of
the economy like farmers; micro, small and medium enterprises; and also faith-sensitive clients who
do not intend to bank with conventional institutions.

SBP makes Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism Regulations more comprehensive

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has made Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Regulations more comprehensive by revising the existing
regulations M-1 to M-5 of Prudential Regulations on Corporate/ Commercial Banking.

While most of the requirements of the new regulations are already in place, some of the
requirements will be effective from October 31, 2012. These regulations have been issued
today to all banks/ development finance institutions (DFls) with a view to introducing a
comprehensive regulatory framework in line with international standards to mitigate the
various risks arising from money laundering and terrorist financing.

The AML/CFT Regulations provide a system of Risk Based Approach under which
customers will be profiled as per risk involved. A framework of Scenario based ranking of
customers has been developed, which will help in detecting abnormal behavior or transactions
during the course of relationship. The revised system will ensure clean and transparent banking
transactions on the one hand and will enable the country to meet international standards on
the other.

The provisions of Regulations introduce a system of comprehensive list of ‘Red Alerts’ in
the context of Pakistan, which will trigger scrutiny of accounts and transactions to ensure that
proceeds of crime are not processed through the banking channels.

To address the issue of rigidity in obtaining documents for opening accounts, the list of
identification and verification documents has been expanded and NADRA Receipt/ Token
included as eligible document for opening of bank account. This will enable customers to open
bank account by submitting any document issued by NADRA including CNIC, Passport, NARA,
POC or even a NADRA Receipt/ Token. The new Regulations now require banks/DFls to keep
record for a minimum period of 10 years.

With the view to tracing back the illegal transactions, it is mandatory on banks/ DFls to
obtain a copy of CNIC from occasional customers/walk-in customers conducting cash
transactions above Rs. 1 million and in case of online transfers without any limit. Banks/ DFls
now have to capture, retain and provide at the beneficiary end, all relevant details of customers
while transferring funds between the cities.

In case of wire transfers, clear responsibilities of ordering, beneficiary and intermediary
institution have been outlined for compliance of banks/ DFls. Customers’ profiles should be
linked with automated transaction monitoring software for creation of alerts in case of
suspicious transactions/activities.

Pakistan’s banking sector well placed to withstand
modest shocks: Shahid Kardar

The banking sector in Pakistan has been able to withstand headwinds from weakening
macroeconomic fundamentals since 2007. Although banks face increased credit risk, the overall sector is
well placed to withstand modest shocks as they build their inventory of government securities. This was
stated by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Shahid H. Kardar in a message embodied in SBP
Annual Report on the working of the Bank (Performance Review) for the year 2009-10 (FY10) which was
released today.

‘Furthermore, in response to emerging dynamics in the macro-financial environment, the SBP has
rationalized the minimum capital requirement and its implementation schedule, which will provide breathing
space to the banking sector in this difficult macroeconomic environment’, he said and added that the State
Bank continued to strive for a balance between price stability and support for economic growth while
safeguarding the soundness and stability of the financial system during FY10.

While highlighting some of the key policy measures undertaken by SBP during FY10, Mr. Kardar
said that in response to a changing inflation outlook, SBP adjusted its stance on monetary policy. The
decline in inflation during the initial months of FY10 and a relative improvement in the macroeconomic
situation, allowed the central bank to ease its monetary policy stance, he said and added that as the growing
fiscal deficit and unexpectedly low external receipts increased risks of a relapse into macroeconomic
instability, and as inflationary pressures resurfaced in H2-FY10, SBP decided to pause the easing cycle and
subsequently increased its policy rate in July and September 2010.

He said that the State Bank had increased the frequency of its monetary policy statements from four
to six times a year. With a view to improving communication with the market the monetary policy
framework itself experienced significant change when the SBP introduced an interest rate corridor in August
2009. “This framework has anchored short-term interest rates and improved liquidity management in the
money market,” he added.

The SBP Governor pointed out that the exchange rate during FY10 continued to reflect market
conditions, which helped narrow the external imbalance and improve macroeconomic stability. Foreign
exchange reserves, which were at $12.425 billion at the close of FY09, increased by $4.325 billion to reach
an all time high of $16.750 at the close of FY10, he said and added that SBP’s decision to enhance banks’
Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit also strengthened the market’s capacity to handle larger volumes of
foreign exchange transactions without additional volatility in the exchange rate.

Mr. Kardar said that the State Bank launched an Electronic Bond Trading Platform in January 2010
for the development of fixed-income markets. ‘This system, which primarily focused on government
securities, also has the capacity to support trading of corporate debt instruments,’ he added.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 29, 2019

Economic data released since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in January 2019
indicates that the impact of stabilization measures continues to unfold. In particular, the current
account deficit recorded a sizeable contraction during the first two months of 2019, which, together
with bi-lateral inflows, helped ease pressures on SBP’s foreign exchange reserves. These
developments on the external front have improved stability in the financial markets, reduced
uncertainty and improved businesses confidence, as reflected in various surveys. Nonetheless,
despite narrowing, the current account deficit remains high, fiscal consolidation is slower than
anticipated, and core inflation continues to tise.

Average headline CPI inflation reached 6.5 percent in Jul-Feb FY19 compared to 3.8 percent
recorded in the same period last year. Meanwhile, YoY CPI inflation has risen considerably to 7.2
percent in January 2019 and further to 8.2 percent in February 2019 - the highest YoY increase in
inflation since June 2014. These pressures on headline inflation are explained by adjustments in the
administered prices of electricity and gas, significant increase in perishable food prices, and the
continued unfolding impact of exchange rate depreciation. Core inflation maintained its 13-month
upward trajectory accelerating to 8.8 percent in February 2019 from 5.2 percent a year earlier.
Further, rising input costs on the back of higher energy prices and the lagged impact of exchange
rate depreciation are likely to maintain upward pressure on inflation despite a moderation in
aggregate demand due to a proactive monetary management. As a result, headline CPI inflation is
projected to fall in the range of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for FY19.

Amidst the efforts to curtail inflationary pressures and reduce the otherwise widening
macroeconomic imbalances, domestic economic activity experienced the brunt of the stabilization
measutes implemented thus far. In particular, Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) declined by 2.3
percent during Jul-Jan FY19 against 7.2 percent growth recorded in the same period last year. The
latest available estimates of major crops also depict a lackluster performance by the agriculture
sector. The slowdown in commodity producing sectors has downside implications for growth in
services sector as well. Similarly, a deceleration in consumer demand and capital investments,
reflected through a cut in development spending and deceleration in credit for fixed investments,
indicates a moderation in domestic demand. In this backdrop, the real GDP growth is projected to
be around 3.5 percent in FY19,

Owing to stabilization measures, the current account deficit narrowed to US$ 8.8 billion in Jul-Feb
FY19 compared to a deficit of US$ 11.4 billion during the same period last year- a fall of 22.6
percent. This includes a notable pace of retrenchment of the current account deficit by 59.9 percent
during the first two months of 2019 over the same period last year. This reduction in the external
balance was mainly driven by a 29.7 percent decline in the trade deficit in goods and services as well
as a strong growth in remittances. The reduction in the trade deficit is in large part driven by import
compression- this decline would have been even more pronounced if not for a rise in oil prices.
Exports, in dollar value, during this period remained flat, however in terms of quantum there has
been a notable improvement. Though still posing a significant challenge in term of its financing, the
natrowing of the current account deficit has translated into some stability in the foreign exchange
market.

Dr Shamshad Akhtar receives the Best
Central Bank Governor of the Year Award

Senior Editor, The Banker Magazine, Ms. Karina Robinson presented the Central
Bank Governor of the Year in Asia 2008 Award to the State Bank Governor,
Dr Shamshad Akhtar at a simple but impressive ceremony held at a local hotel in Karachi
today.

Speaking on the occasion, Ms Robinson paid glowing tributes to the SBP
Governor. She said Dr Akhtar has been able to restructure many aspects of the economy
and implement many new policies in the banking sector, including an important financial
inclusion strategy. She said Dr Akhtar managed to tighten monetary policy and through
decisive action was successful in 2006 and 2007 in sustaining a downward trend in
inflationary pressures while facilitating record strong growth in the economy. Monetary
tightening has had the important impact of maintaining hard-won macroeconomic
stability that has encouraged increased investment flows, she added.

She said another important central bank strategy shift has been the decision to
gradually reduce commercial banks’ reliance on refinancing facilities and encourage
banks to fully accommodate private sector and export credit requirements, thereby
helping the private sector. Ms Robinson said Dr Akhtar believes there is a high degree of
financial exclusion and she has outlined a comprehensive strategy to improve access to
financial services to the poor through a far-reaching microfinance development plan and
the expansion of branch networks and Islamic banking in underserved areas.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Akhtar said that it was not only an honor for her but
for the country also, which now has an efficient financial system. She said the banking
sector reforms have brought in competition within the system, improved internal
efficiency and broadened access to the middle class. She said that these reforms would
not have been possible without the cooperation of the chief executives of banks.

Dr Akhtar also thanked The Banker Magazine for bestowing this prestigious
award to her. She said that by continuation of the financial sector reforms, the country
would be able to reduce poverty significantly in the years ahead.

The ceremony arranged by The Banker Magazine, a subsidiary of the prestigious
and renowned newspaper, Financial Times of London, was attended, among others, by
Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor, Mr Asad Qureshi, Executive Director and Mr Riaz
Riazuddin, Economic Advisor of SBP, besides Chief Executives of commercial
banks/multinational firms and notable industrialists.

It may be recalled that the last year Dr Akhtar was conferred with the ‘Best
Central Bank Governor for Asia 2007’ award in recognition of her outstanding
contribution in the overall financial sector and monetary policy management in Pakistan
by Emerging Markets Newspaper, a part of Euromoney Institutional Investor plc, one of
the largest and most respected providers of financial information worldwide.

SBP instructs banks to ensure availability of

ATM services and fresh currency notes to the public

State Bank of Pakistan held a meeting on July 10, 2015 with the Group Heads of Operations of all
commercial banks to address the distribution of fresh currency notes to general public,
uninterrupted availability of ATM services during Eid holidays and issues relating to deduction of
Withholding Tax (WHT) on bank transactions. The meeting was co-chaired by Mr. Muhammad Ashraf
Khan, Executive Director BPR Group and Mr. Qasim Nawaz, Managing Director, SBP-BSC along with
other high officials of SBP and SBP-BSC.

SBP highlighted that to meet the needs of general public on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, sixteen SBP-BSC
field offices have started distribution of fresh currency notes to the public. Besides, SBP-BSC has
provided fresh currency notes of Rs 141 billion to commercial banks for onward provision to general
public. This supply is in addition to the fresh notes provided to general public from the counter of
SBP-BSC and through new SMS-based mechanism. The banks were emphasized to ensure the
availability of fresh currency notes at their counters.

Commercial banks were advised to meticulously comply with the SBP’s guidelines and instructions
regarding management of ATM operations in order to ensure continuous availability of ATM services
during Eid-ul-Fitr holidays. Banks were stressed to make adequate back-up arrangements for
ensuring availability of ATM services round the clock and put in place comprehensive operating
procedures to timely resolve the cases of cash replenishment, breakdown of ATMs, Systems and
Network problems etc.

As a consequence of recent tax amendments, SBP advised banks to ensure that the WHT should not
be deducted from such person (tax filers) that are not subject to this tax. Banks should make
arrangements to refund the deducted amount to such customers, if the amount is deducted from a
tax filer. They were also advised to provide WHT statements to the customers.

SBP briefed about its financial inclusion program that envisages 50% increase in financial inclusion by
2020. In this regard, commercial banks were advised to expedite their readiness to launch Aasan
Account for low risk profile customers with simplified due diligence procedures within the deadline
of 31-07-2015. SBP advised that in case of non-compliance with the instructions, strict regulatory

measures will be taken.

Revision of Branchless Banking Regulations

SBP has revamped Branchless Banking Regulations to keep pace with the international
branchless banking practices and to achieve the targets set out in National Financial Inclusion
Strategy (NFIS) of Pakistan. This regulatory framework outlines the minimum requirements
to be adopted by banks offering branchless banking in the market place.

According to revised Regulations, the Board of Directors of banks would be responsible to
provide the strategic direction and maintain an oversight while senior management will
institute necessary internal controls and ensure adherence to applicable laws and
regulations.

Scope of alternate delivery channels and technologies has been expanded through revised
Regulations to include 3G and 4G spectrum, POS terminals, internet banking and ATM/debit
cards etc. for providing branchless banking services.

The transaction limits for Level-O and Level-1 branchless banking accounts have been
increased to encourage opening of more branchless banking accounts for the objective of
financial inclusion. Branchless Banking Level -3 accounts have been merged with Level — 2
accounts for facilitation and operational ease of customers and the banks.

Level 1 Accounts shall be opened either through traditional account opening process or
through Biometric Verification System. Further, State Bank has also allowed opening of
remote accounts for Level O customers to promote financial services among all segments of
society.

State Bank has also introduced Person to Inter Bank Funds Transfer (IBFT) service with and
without biometric system. The limit for Person to Person (non account holders) transactions
conducted through biometric verification system has also been increased.

State Bank of Pakistan has always promoted financial inclusion in the country by expanding
outreach of banking services to all segments of the society. In this regard, SBP has launched
NFIS in 2015 wherein a target of 50% growth in bank accounts by adult population by the
year 2020 has been set out to enhance the outreach of basic financial services to
unbanked/underserved population. Branchless Banking is the main driver and most effective
tool for achievement of targets set in NFIS.

Availability of SBP Helpline for customers of banks and public warning against fraudsters calling for
personal information citing situation under COVID-19

SBP has taken additional measures to facilitate bank customers that are faced with extraordinary
challenges arising out of COVID-19 situation in the country. They can now approach SBP through its
helpline service in case their queries or complaints are not being responded by banks. SBP also
encourages public to use digital payment services as much as possible to help banks providing their
services with minimal staff to ensure their safety.SBP has taken notice of phone calls to
banks’ customers by fraudsters seeking personal information taking advantage of the current
conditions. Following are the details of measures taken.

Availability of Helpline: To facilitate banking consumers, SBP has advised all banks to ensure that their
call centers/helplines are available 24/7 for instant customer support. Banking consumers are
encouraged to approach banks through helpline for queries orlodging complaints. In
case complainants do not get an appropriate response from banks, they mayapproach SBP
helpline at 021-111-727-273, which will remain available during office hours. To cater to the needs
of the public for facilitation and guidance, SBP has enhanced its helpline capacity by deploying more
agents at its call center.

Implementation of safety measures: The general public is encouraged to take appropriate safety
measures in the context of the Corona Virus and use alternate delivery channels where possible. SBP
recognizes that the employees of banks and other financial institutions are providing services amid the
difficult working conditions arising due to COVID-19. For the protection of bank employees and
customers, work place safety and to meet the operational challenges in serving the bank
customers, banks have been advised to implement guidelines issued by World Health Organization, the
Government of Pakistan and the Provincial Governments in letter and spirit. Nevertheless, bank
employees and customers still facing difficulties or having concerns over arrangements may bring this
to the notice of SBP. For this purpose, queries, concerns, complaints may be emailed to SBP

at cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk.

Beware of fraudsters calling to collect personal information. SBP has time and again advised the
general public through various channels of communication not to disclose or share any personal
information about their bank accounts or credit/debit cards including CNIC number, debit or credit
card number, passwords, PINs and one-time password (OTP), etc. on incoming phone calls or
messages. It has been brought to the notice of SBP that fraudsters, imitating as officials of SBP, bank
or any other government agency, have been attempting to seek personal
information from the public on the pretext of verification of account due to emergency conditions
under COVID-19 pandemic. It is reiterated that SBP, banks or any other agency are not collecting
information from banking customers regarding their bank accounts or cards. SBP never asks for any
personal information directly from bank customers. The general public is, therefore, advised again not
to disclose personal information on incoming calls. Details of any such call or message received by the
public may also be reported to SBP Helpline at 021-111-727-273 or
emailed at cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk

Branchless Banking network expands by 16 percent
to 22,512 in second quarter of FY12: SBP publication

The Branchless Banking (BB) network in Pakistan expanded by 16 percent in the second quarter
(October- December 2011) of the current fiscal year (2011-12) to reach 22,512 agents covering the
entire length and breadth of the country, says State Bank’s ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’ released
today.

According to the publication, the number of Branchless Banking accounts increased by 40
percent to 929,184 in October- December, 2011 period as compared to the previous quarter. The total
Branchless Banking deposits jumped by 169 percent to Rs 503 million in the quarter under review as
compared to the previous quarter, it said, adding that the number of Branchless Banking transactions
during the second quarter surged by 30 percent to 20.6 million while the value of transactions showed a
growth of 35 percent to reach Rs. 79,410 million.

The average size of branchless banking transaction was Rs. 3,855 while the average number of
daily transactions was 228,855. This shows that mobile phone technology and agent-based banking are
helping access to financial services by the hitherto unbanked poor, the Newsletter said, adding that by
the end of December 2011, more than 929,000 customers have been registered as m-wallet users.

The Newsletter said that innovative branchless banking models have been penetrating in all
areas of payments such as utility bills, Government-to-Persons (G2P), Persons-to-Persons (P2P)
payments while scaling up other services relating to deposits and loans.

Bills payment & top-ups remained the dominating activity in the quarter under review with 53
percent share in total numbers, followed by fund transfers and deposits with share of 39 percent and 8
percent respectively, it said and added that the P2P payments remained the most popular mechanism
with 74% share in the total funds transfer. Initial high concentration in P2P transactions suggests that
the industry needs to develop a viable value-proposition for registration and activation of mobile
accounts, it added.

The ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’ covers chronology of Branchless Banking developments in
Pakistan, a detailed BB growth analysis, snapshot of the major models - Easypaisa and Omni, and
important BB events/ initiatives. The BB Newsletter can be accessed at the following web link of SBP

Initiative to Enhance Efficiency of SBP BSC Operations

The SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP-BSC) was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of
State Bank of Pakistan in January, 2002, under the SBP Banking Services Corporation Ordinance 2001.

As a subsidiary SBP (BSC) caters to primarily operational and logistic work and its functions are being
managed through a network of 16 offices, spread across major cities, and Head office in Karachi. The
corporation has been entrusted with operational responsibilities related to currency distribution,
Foreign Currency Operations, and Banker to the Governments, as also dissemination and
implementation of policies on behalf of Development Finance Group (DFG) of SBP alongside provision
of non-core services to SBP that include, Medical, Engineering and Security.

An analysis of the existing work quantum of SBP (BSC) reflects that performance of SBP BSC at times
is affected due to the fact that majority of its operations requiring immediate decision making by
senior management are being performed at field offices located in Central and North Regions.

As an initiative to improve organizational performance, enhance effectiveness of internal controls,
ensure consistency in decisions and bring about efficiency in operations, the management of SBP BSC
has decided to carry out some of its functions from Central and North Regions. Accordingly out of 11
departments of Banking Services Corporation five departments, dealing with currency management,
government banking, internal audit, Foreign Exchange operations and implementation of DFG related
policies are being partially relocated to these regions for greater operational efficiency and logistic
ease.

Here, it may be added that the work of Currency Management is already being performed through
Issue Offices at, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta in addition to Karachi. Likewise, Foreign Exchange
Operations and DFSD both have their units functioning at these offices. Further, a sizeable
proportion of these departments shall be retained at Karachi to meet the needs of southern market.

It would be pertinent to mention here that State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will continue to function from
Karachi and none of its department is being shifted to any other city.

Over 800,000 Branchless Banking accounts
have been opened: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has disclosed that over 800,000
Branchless Banking accounts have so far been opened while the average number of transactions per day
is around 180,000 and the average ticket size per transaction stands at Rs 3,700.

Speaking at a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing ceremony held between the State
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) at a local hotel in Karachi
today, he said that the agent network under Branchless Banking umbrella has exceeded 20,000 agents,
who have helped to channelize 50 million financial transactions worth more than Rs 190 billion while the
number of bank branches at present is only ten thousand (10,000), he said, adding that these agents
outlets/touch points are spread across several cities, towns and smaller villages in Pakistan.

The SBP Governor said that the Branchless Banking has also proved to be an effective
instrument in channelizing the Government to Persons (G2P) payments in trying times like serving
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and the people affected by devastating floods and rains for the last
two years. The Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) beneficiaries are also being served effectively
through this mechanism, he said, adding that this channel is expected to continue playing an important
role towards promotion of financial inclusion and the management of Government to Person (G2P)
programs like salary disbursements, pensions, BISP, Watan Cards, Pakistan Cards and tax collection
services, etc. ‘The existing Branchless Banking deployments can cater to the needs of over 10 million
potential beneficiaries of G2P payments in Pakistan’, he added.

Mr. Anwar said the technology has made it possible for banking industry to offer a wide menu of
services such as e-Banking, Branchless/Mobile Banking, Electronic Clearing Systems, Electronic Funds
Transfer, Smart Cards, plastic cards of various forms etc.

Appreciating the initiatives of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the Ministry of
Information Technology (MOIT) to promote and develop the emerging field of branchless and mobile
banking in the country, he said that it is also heartening to note that PTA is also playing an important
role by encouraging it’s regulatees to play their due part in provision of smooth and efficient Branchless
Banking services.

‘It should be a matter of great comfort and satisfaction for banking and telecom industries that
their respective regulators i.e. SBP and PTA share the vision and working in tandem to provide an
enabling regulatory environment for provision of mobile / branchless banking services’, SBP Governor
added.

Keeping in view the importance of interconnectivity for promotion of Branchless / Mobile
banking, he said that SBP and PTA are working very closely in developing an appropriate Regulatory
framework for Third Party Solution Provider (TPSP). Currently, a joint regulatory Committee of SBP and
PTA is considering issuance of Regulations for TPSP, he said, adding that the core objective of TPSP

SBP enhances scope of its Renewable Energy Refinance Scheme to encourage
production of clean energy

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the scope of its Refinance Scheme for Renewable Energy by
allowing financing under category III of the scheme to solar and wind based energy sale companies. In
light of the feedback received from stakeholders, the size of the project established by vendor/
supplier/ energy sale company has been enhanced from 1 MW to 5 MW. Accordingly, the cumulative
financing limit has also been increased from Rs.1 billion to Rs.2 billion. Details are provided in the
circular at:

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL23.htm

SBP Financing Scheme for Renewable Energy was announced in June 2016 with an aim to help
addressing the challenges of energy shortages and climate change in the country. The scheme
comprised of two categories: Category 1 allowed financing for setting up of renewable energy
power projects with capacity ranging from 1 MW to 50 MW for own use or selling of electricity
to the national grid or combination of both. Category II allowed financing to domestic,
agriculture, commercial and industrial borrowers for installation of renewable energy based
projects/ solutions of up-to 1 MW to generate electricity for own use or selling to the
grid/distribution company under net metering. Later, in July 2019, SBP introduced a new
Category III for facilitating financing to vendors/suppliers for installation of wind and solar
systems/solutions of up to 1 MW. SBP also launched a Shariah complaint version of the scheme
in August 2019.

Since the introduction of the scheme, total outstanding financing under the Scheme has
reached to Rs.15.6 billion for 217 projects having potential of adding 292 MW of energy supply.
This revision in the scheme is expected to not only attract fresh local and foreign investment
in the sector but also facilitate production of clean energy in the country, helping in managing
climate change.

Agricultural Credit Disbursement Surpasses Target
To Reach Rs168.3 Bln In Fiscal Year 2006-07

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan informed the
Agriculture Credit Consultative Committee that commercial and specialized banks have
surpassed the target of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector in the fiscal year
2006-07. Total disbursements reached Rs 168.3 billion — representing -22.4% growth
over the preceding year disbursement of Rs137.5 billion and exceeding the actual target
of Rs160 billion.

While chairing the annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee
held in Karachi today, Dr Akhtar commended all those banks that played a significant
role in achieving the target.

The big five commercial banks namely Allied Bank Ltd., Habib Bank Ltd., MCB
Bank, National Bank of Pakistan and United Bank Ltd. as a group disbursed a total of
Rs80.2 billion, against the full-year target of Rs80 billion. Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd.
(ZTBL), Punjab Provincial Co-operative Bank Ltd. (PPCBL) and domestic private banks
(DPBs) disbursed Rs56.3 billion, Rs7.9 billion and Rs23.8 billion, respectively against
the target of Rs48 billion, Rs9 billion and Rs23 billion.

The Committee noted the significant rise in credit and its absorptive capacity in
Punjab as its provincial government has created a good enabling environment and
developed proper institutional arrangement for promoting credit delivery. Other
provinces can draw some important lessons from this province in setting a supportive
credit delivery environment.

For FY2007/2008, the Committee recommended the target of Rs200 billion for
credit disbursement to farmers. This assumes combined lending of Rs132 billion from
commercial banks and Rs68 billion for specialized institutions i.e. ZTBL & PPCBL. The
Committee also recommended province-wise allocations of disbursements, based on the
cropped area and absorption capacity of each province, Azad Jammu & Kashmir and
Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

During the meeting, Dr Akhtar constituted following Committees to lay down
additional ground work critical to be supportive of transformation of Pakistan’s rural
development. These Committees would focus on

(i) development of agricultural data base in conformity with international
standards and development of methodology for proper estimation of the
agriculture and rural credit requirements of the country in conformity with the
overall agricultural production as set by the respective ministries;

(ii) preparing a holistic development strategy for enhancing rural financing
whereby the development programs launched by federal and provincial
ministries would be supportive of facilitating effective intermediation of
agriculture and rural credit delivery; and

(iii) to develop guidelines for lending technology and supportive credit
enhancement mechanisms.

SBP takes measures to support exporters affected by loss of demand due to COVID-19

SBP has a strategic objective to support exports for sustained improvement in Pakistan’s balance of
payments and growth. To this end SBP provides refinance to banks to provide cheap credit at interest
rates that vary between 3 to 6 percent to exporters for working capital and new projects under
Export Finance Schemes (EFS) and Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) schemes. The total subsidized
credit to exporters outstanding under both these schemes is currently approximately Rs. 660 billion.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Pakistan’s exporters are facing declining demand in overseas markets
and problems in executing existing orders. To support exporters in these circumstances and to
prevent current liquidity problems from turning into solvency problems amongst exporters, SBP has
announced following several measures today.

Relaxation in matching amount. Availing cheaper credit under EFS is linked with the export
performance. Currently, exporters are required to export twice the amount of borrowed funds. In
case of failure in meeting the requirement penalties are imposed and the credit limit for the next year
is also reduced accordingly. SBP has reduced the performance requirement from twice to one-and-a-
half times that will be effective for the current year as well as for FY21.

Extension in time period to meet performance requirements. Exporters were required to show
performance under the EFS schemes by end-June 2020. This period has been extended by 6 months
to end Dec. 2020. Since the additional period will also be counted towards setting new limits, this will
help the exporters in availing higher limits for FY21.

Extension in time period to ship goods. Exporters availing the subsidized credit schemes are required
to ship their goods within 6 months of availing credit under EFS. In case of failure, penalties are
imposed. This period has been extended from six to twelve months. Therefore, exporters will not be
liable to pay penalties due to breach of this condition during January to June 2020.

Relaxation in conditions for Long Term Financing Facility. Exporters who want to avail credit under
Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) are required to have exports worth 50 percent, or USD 5 million,
of the total sales to become eligible. This limit has been reduced to 40 percent or USD4 million for all
the borrowings under LTTF during the period January 01, 2020 to September 30, 2020. Moreover,
under the requirement of annual projected exports performance for four years to avail LTFF for new
or BMR projects has been extended by another one year. Now the projected exports performance
will be measured in 5 years.

Other relaxations. Another major relaxation has been provided to the exporters on foreign exchange
side. Keeping in view the difficulties faced by the exporters, SBP has also allowed banks to enhance
the time period for realization of exports proceeds from existing requirement of 180 days to 270
days on a case by case basis where the delay is related to COVID-19. This would help exporters to
provide extended time to their buyers in making payment due to above pandemic. Likewise, to

SBP introduces a transparent mechanism with complete delegation to banks for remitting
disinvestment proceeds to facilitate foreign direct investment

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a new mechanism to enable companies in Pakistan to
conveniently remit out disinvestment proceeds to their foreign shareholders. The goal of this initiative is
to make Pakistan a more attractive place for investment by increasing investors’ confidence and support
ease of doing business. The new mechanism also incorporates feedback received from investors and other
stakeholders.

As per the previous mechanism, a designated bank required prior approval of the State Bank for
remittance of disinvestment proceeds above market value, for listed securities and, above breakup value,
for unlisted securities. This requirement presented numerous constraints for investors.

Under the new mechanism, the bank designated by the company has been delegated the authority to
remit the entire disinvestment proceeds to non-resident shareholders, upon submission of required
documents, by following a convenient mechanism without referring the case to SBP. The number of
required documents would be in accordance with the size of the transaction.

e For disinvestment proceeds not exceeding the market value / break-up value, the required
documents would include copy of Share Purchase Agreement, broker’s memo in case of quoted
shares/break-up value certificate of a QCR rated practicing Chartered Accountant in case of
unlisted shares, latest audited financials of the company, signed M-Form, and an undertaking
from the buyer that in case the transaction is between related parties, the same has been
concluded at an arms-length basis.

e For disinvestment proceeds exceeding the market value / break-up value, the additional required
documents would include a detailed valuation/ transaction due diligence by the buyer showing
basis, methodology and key valuation metrics used for valuation. In case the total remittance of
disinvestment proceeds exceeds US Dollar 50 million (or equivalent in other currencies) during a
span of six months, the applicant shall also submit an independent review of the buyer’s valuation,

Pakistan’s economy shows signs of improvement
but weaknesses remain: SBP Report

Pakistan’s economy continued to show macroeconomic stability in the third quarter of
the current 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9) as the Government focused on macroeconomic reforms
and the economy benefitted from a sharp decline in international commodity prices and other
favorable developments.

According to the Third Quarterly Report of the State Bank of Pakistan on the State of the
Economy released today, inflation began to decline, the current account deficit narrowed
substantially with a corresponding stability in the exchange rate, and fiscal discipline was
maintained with the fiscal deficit being reported to be 3.1 percent of GDP for July-March FY09.

However, the Report noted with caution: “while this improvement in macroeconomic
indicators is very encouraging, the economy is not out of the woods yet. Major macroeconomic
indicators show underlying weaknesses which, if not addressed, could hamper economic
recovery.”

The Report said that recent easing of inflationary pressures is indeed encouraging as the
headline inflation - measured by consumer price index (CPI) - dropped to 17.2 percent on year-
on-year (YoY) basis in April 2009 from its peak of 25.3 percent YoY in August 2008. In particular,
a sharp downtrend in food inflation is a welcome development as this component of CPI affects
low income groups the most. CPI food inflation fell from its peak of 34.1 percent YoY during
August 2008 to 17.0 percent in April 2009.

It said the downtrend in inflation owes to both, favorable international and domestic
developments, as well as a deceleration in domestic demand. The latter, in particular, reflects
the monetary tightening by the State Bank, as well as the complementary improvement in fiscal
discipline, especially after November 2008. It is worth noting that the acceleration in the fall of
inflation is becoming visible only after the monetization of the fiscal deficit was halted, the
Report added.

The Report projected that in FYO9 average CPI inflation in the current fiscal year is
expected to stay between 20.5 percent and 21.5 percent, whereas Gross Domestic Product
growth is likely to be 2.0 percent to 3.0 percent and fiscal deficit may hover between 4.0 and
4.5 percent of GDP.

SBP hosted SAARC Seminar on “Emerging Trends in Good Governance of Banking Sector in SAARC
Region”

Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan during his inaugural address in a seminar on
“Emerging Trends in Good Governance of Banking Sector” in SAARC countries highlighted the
importance of efficient and robust governance structure in the banking industry for sustainable
economic growth of a country. Besides Pakistan, the captioned seminar was attended by delegates from
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

While addressing to the participants from SAARC member countries at National Institute of Banking and
Finance (NIBAF), Islamabad, Dr. Baqir said that corporate governance is corner stone for the success of
any business entity. However, for financial institutions, the importance of corporate governance
becomes even more critical as banks are highly leveraged entities facing a wide range of risks in their
day-to-day operations. Therefore, the scope and approach to banks’ corporate governance requires a
different and specific regulatory framework not only because of their leveraged business model but
also due to diverse ownership and group structure.

Dr. Baqir emphasized that boards of the banks with more gender diversity or female representatives
and diversified experience in the fields of IT, risk management, finance and economics can play a
more effective role in achieving the organization’s overall strategic objectives. He also highlighted
that concentration of banks’ shareholding to a few families and their nominees on the Boards is
against the good governance practices and may adversely impact the effectiveness of the Board.

Dr. Baqir further added that independent directors play an important role in banks by exercising their
independent judgement and protect the interest of minority shareholders. He also mentioned that
corporate governance practices in public sector banks are generally weak and less transparent due to
likely political intervention in the affairs of these banks. Therefore, there is a need to rationalize the
shareholding structure of these banks to minimize the undesirable role of governments in their
affairs. Remuneration practices of Board members and compliance of AML/ CFT regime are also
significantly important areas where the Boards need to assume enhanced responsibilities to meet the
international best practices.

He also cited few of SBP's efforts such as Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of Board of Directors,
Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk Management Framework, Governance Framework for
Banks’ Overseas Operations, Compliance Risk Management and Internal Audit Function Guidelines
and Streamlining the existing regulatory requirements on remuneration of Boards and management.

In his closing remarks, he suggested that Terms of reference (ToRs) of SAARCFINANCE network may
be revisited to align the same with emerging challenges being faced by central banks in the region. He
further added that expanding business arenas, globalization of financial activities, emergence of new
financial products and increased level of competition have not only opened up opportunities but also
increased the potential risks from such developments. Therefore, such regional forums are very

Farmers reap benefit as banks’ credit disbursement grows

Pakistan’s farmers are benefiting as banks’ agriculture credit disbursement nears the annual target. During first

SBP Governor prods commercial banks to increase
credit disbursement to private sector

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has asked the commercial
banks to increase lending to the private sector in order to provide necessary stimulus to
the economy.

Presiding over a meeting of the Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) at
the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this afternoon, Mr. Raza urged the banks to take a
‘liberal view’ of the economy and play a role of a catalyst in the economic growth of the
country. “Liquidity in the banking system has never been as high as it is today,” he said
and added increased credit disbursement by banks will provide a stimulus to the
economy.

SBP Governor acknowledged that due to the current global and domestic
economic scenario the banks have become conservative and their terms of loans have
become stringent. But he said the growth in non-performing loans (NPLs) of banks has
slowed in the last quarter of 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9), which is a good omen.

He informed the meeting that overall private sector credit (PSC) after recording
the growth of 16.5 percent during FYO8 registered an increase of only 0.7 percent
during FYO9, mainly due to slowdown in economic activity coupled with the global
recession and rising NPLs etc.

Mr. Raza explained that PSC during July- December 2008 grew by 7 percent and
constituted 62 percent of total domestic credit. However, since December private
sector credit has witnessed a sharp fall, with an accumulative negative growth of 6
percent during Dec-June FYO9. “This behaviour is mainly due to slowing economic
activity, rising NPLs, partial settlement of power sector debt etc.,” he added.

Similarly, he pointed out that due to global recession country’s exports were
affected and on a cumulative basis (July-May FYO9) it declined by $202 million, thus
reducing the demand for credit. In addition to this, commodity prices reached a peak in
July 2008 and fell significantly thereafter, thus dampening the demand pressures in the
economy and hence the need for import related credit utilization, he added.

He disclosed that loans for working capital exhibited a decline of 7.6
percent during FYO9 mainly in the textile, manufacturing, commerce and trade sectors
while fixed investment financing increased by 26.4 percent mainly for investment in
manufacturing, electricity, gas & water and transport, storage & communication
sectors. On cumulative basis, credit for export finance has registered a disbursement of
Rs 15.4 billion as compared to Rs 19 billion last year, he added.

Mr. Raza pointed out that agricultural credit disbursement has shown a rising
trend as it increased by Rs21.4 billion or 10 percent during FYO9. Similarly,
infrastructure finance also grew by 43 percent mainly due to capital investment in
power generation and telecommunication sectors.

The banking sector has remained sound and stable
in Q3CY17, says the 3"" QPR of the Banking Sector

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 30""
September, 2017, has been released by SBP today. As highlighted in the report, less than normal
seasonal fall in advances along with improved liquidity and strong solvency — well above the
minimum benchmark — are the key highlights of the 3rd quarter of CY17.

Despite the seasonal net retirements in commodity financing and sugar sector, the overall gross
advances (domestic) to private sector have declined marginally; significantly lesser than the
established 3 quarter financing dip. Advances demand from textile and other sectors (agriculture,
automobiles, electronics etc.) have been promising. Noticeably, the share of fixed investment (long-
term) advances in overall advances is persistently rising. Banks have continued to invest in short term
MTBs while investment in PIBs and Sukuk have declined. The deposit mobilization has remained on
track, primarily, on the back of growth in saving and fixed deposits.

Asset quality has improved as Non Performing Loans (NPLs) to gross advances (infection) ratio has
moved down to 9.2 percent as of end September 2017 from 9.3 percent as of end June 2017.
However, profitability has moderated further with the banking sector earning profit (before tax) of
PKR 195.3 billion during Jan-Sep, 2017 (ROA of 1.6 percent and ROE of 19.1 percent). Encouragingly,
Net Interest Income (NII) has improved (Year-on-Year basis) on account of rising interest earned on
advances. Capital Adequacy Ratio of the banking sector at 15.4 percent is well above the minimum
required level of 10.65 percent and advocates that banks have enough buffers available to meet
additional financing need of the market.

The report is accessible at URL: http://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/q_reviews/qpr.htm

SBP introduces incentive and penalty mechanism for banks to promote housing and
construction financing

 

Building upon its earlier measure of setting mandatory target for banks to extend mortgage loans and
financing for developers and builders, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a mechanism to
incentivize meeting these targets. The mechanism also penalizes the banks for any shortfall in meeting
the target.

According to this mechanism, commencing from December 31, 2020, banks will find an incentive of
maintaining reduced Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) with SBP, in the next quarter, in case they
achieve or exceed the target of financing for housing and construction of buildings set for the quarter.
The amount of CRR to be maintained for the forthcoming quarter will be reduced by an amount equal
to increase in housing and construction finance from 30‘June 2020 to the end of the relevant quarter.
This incentive, however, will be subject to a ceiling of 1 percent of the total demand and time liabilities
based on which CRR is calculated. Further, the banks shall continue to maintain daily minimum CRR,
which is currently at 3 percent.

Conversely, if the banks fail to meet the target, they will be penalized by requiring to maintain extra
CRR by an amount equal to the shortage from the target. It would be pertinent to mention here that
banks do not earn any return on the amount of CRR maintained. Therefore, a decrease in amount of
CRR works as an incentive for banks, whereas an increase in amount of CRR serves as a penalty for
banks. Further details of the incentive mechanism are provided in the circular issued to banks and
available at: https://www.sbp.org.pk/dmmd/2020/CL3.htm

SBP has been actively working with banks to support finance for the promotion of housing and
construction of building activities in the country. The growth of the housing and construction sector is
vital for the economy, due to its linkages with a number of allied industries and potential for jobs
creation and Pakistan has lower private sector credit to GDP than many comparable countries. In order
to enhance the flow of financing towards this sector, SBP has required banks to achieve mandatory
targets, equivalent to 5 percent of their domestic private sector credit by December 31, 2021, to
finance the housing and construction activities. Accordingly, quarterly targets from December 31, 2020
till December 31, 2021 have been agreed with the banks.

SBP expects that this incentive mechanism, through changes in the CRR structure, will result in banks
increasing their emphasis on housing and construction finance.

Trend of Strong Workers' Remittances Continues in September

e Workers’ remittances remained above $2 billion for the fourth consecutive month in
September. They increased to $2.3 billion, 31.2 percent higher than the same month last year
and 9 percent higher than in August.

e Onacumulative basis, remittances rose to a record $ 7.1 billion in Q1-FY21, 31.1 higher than the
same period last year.

e The level of remittances in September was slightly higher than SBP’s projections of $ 2
billion. Efforts under the Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) and the gradual re-opening of
major host destinations such as Middle East, Europe and United States contributed to the
sustained increase in workers’ remittances.

Mobile Money is a viable channel for masses to access Financial services:
Wathra

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has said that mobile money
landscape has proved a viable channel for the un-served and underserved masses to access
financial services with minimum know-your-customers (K YC) requirements. He expressed these
views while addressing SBP-CGAP-DFID Workshop on Inclusion-Effective Interoperability
held today at a local hotel in Karachi.

Wathra encouraged the industry to develop interoperability solution in the market to catalyze the
take up of mobile wallets, increase choices for the customers, and expand the business of banks.

Governor SBP said that our objectives for financial inclusion are not only to reach out to poor
people, but also to contribute to banking stability and economic development. ‘In SBP’s vision,
‘Payment System’ and ‘Financial Inclusion’ are mutually-reinforcing, and their linkages are
expected to deepen further in future, he said, adding, ‘In line with this vision, digital financial
inclusion is going to be the cornerstone of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) that
is currently in the stage of formulation.’

Wathra stated that Pakistan mobile phone subscribers are almost 140 million. In contrast, the
banking accounts are only 37 million whereas number of borrowers is as low as 6 million. These
statistics indicate that there exist a large “financially-excluded” market, facing difficulties in
buying goods and services, paying utility bills, borrowing and saving, or investing in their future.
Registering this un-served market through mobile wallets should be our key objective.

It is encouraging to see that the branchless banking sector is proving to be a driving force to
penetrate into the unbanked geographies with an agent network of 168,000 agents, 4.2 million m-
wallets and Rs. 1,063 Billion worth of transactions for the last year. Despite the rapid growth, the
BB industry has however not been able to register mobile wallets massively in comparison to the
potential market.

A robust environment of interoperability in branchless banking shall benefit all participants in
the Payments ecosystem. End users, including consumers, merchants, governments, and other
types of enterprises would find it easier to make and accept payments. Providers to these end
users, including banks, networks and other service providers shall capitalize on each other’s
strengths in interoperable systems that they may not be able to achieve with closed loop (or non-
interoperable) systems.

Dr Akhtar announces Reforms Agenda for

Exchange Companies

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has announced the
blueprint of reforms being introduced in the Exchange Company Sector with a
view to (i) define more clearly the objectives and scope of exchange companies,
(ii) well capitalize the sector, and (iii) bring better market discipline through
enhanced transparency, disclosure and strong monitoring and supervision.
However, these measures will be introduced in a manner that promotes long-term
business interests in an effective and well-encompassing regulatory environment
while seeking to avoid potentially adverse near-term impacts on the service levels
of Exchange Companies for general public. This announcement was made by the
Governor during a meeting with the Heads of Exchange Companies held at the
State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today.

 

Dr Akhtar said that SBP has decided to change its approach from ‘bringing
financial discipline and corporate culture’ to ‘ensuring discipline and maximum
compliance’. In this respect SBP has reviewed the whole regime for exchange
companies with the objective of defining better role and responsibility of exchange
companies. On the enforcement side, the exchange companies should not expect
any leniency. SBP would not spare any company regardless of its market size to
establish the regulatory writ.

She announced that the State Bank is launching the second-phase reforms
for the exchange companies and will issue regulatory guidelines that will set in
motion corporate governance reforms for the exchange companies. A notice
regarding these reforms was issued to exchange companies in the last meeting
chaired by the Governor. “Our intention is to take you (exchange companies)
forward and to promote your businesses provided you abide by rules of business,”
she asserted. She also urged upon the exchange companies to seek mergers &
acquisitions so as to consolidate and strengthen the sector and increase its
efficiency.

While referring to recent speculative trends in the kerb market, Dr
Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has directed the exchange
companies to keep dollar-rupee parity differential between the Inter-Bank and
Kerb markets at rational levels, restrain from speculation and to focus on bringing
in home remittances into the country. “This differential should not be beyond
normal trends seen in the past,” she told exchange companies representatives.

AGRICULTURE CREDIT BY BANKS TO REACH RS. 100
BILLION IN FY05

The Agriculture Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) met at Karachi today under the
Chairmanship of Dr. Ishrat Husain, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan and reviewed the situation
in respect of agriculture credit in the country for July — December, 2004.

The Committee expressed its deep satisfaction that on the basis of the actual results of the
first six months it is most likely that the target for agriculture credit by the banks of Rs. 100
billion originally fixed for 2005-06 will be achieved by June 2005 — one year ahead of its
stipulated date. The banks have already disbursed Rs. 49.1 billion in the first six months against
the year end target of Rs. 85 billion recording an increase of almost 50 percent over the
corresponding period in the previous year. The Committee was gratified that the domestic private
banks had already exceeded their annual target while the big five commercial banks had achieved
63 percent of the target. Together the commercial banks have increased their share to 58 percent
of the total agriculture credit disbursements. It may be recalled that in 1999-2000 the commercial
banks were providing only Rs. 9 billion or 23 percent of the total disbursements to the agriculture
sector. The performance of commercial banks in recovery was also quite impressive as they had
already realized 83 percent of recoverable amounts from the agriculture borrowers.

Subsistence farmers (owning land less than 12.5 acres) received almost 65 percent of the
total agriculture loans followed by economic holding farmers (between 12.5 and 50 acres) whose
share was 20 percent.

The Committee also has begun tracking credit to livestock sector separately from the crop
sector. The disbursements for livestock, poultry and dairy have reached Rs. 4.5 billion or 9
percent of total loans.

Among the uses of credit, fertilizer purchase accounted for 42 percent of all loans in this

six month period. The banks also financed 10,318 tractors during this period.

Governor SBP announces commemorative coin of Rs 50 ina
condolence gathering for late Edhi

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has said SBP would issue a
commemorative coin of Rs. 50 in memory of Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi as a small token of appreciation to
remember him in the history of Pakistan.

He was addressing to a ‘condolence’ gathering to pay tributes to late Abdul Sattar Edhi today who
served the needy, the orphans, the widows and the destitute by rising above the considerations of
caste, color and creed.

The event was attended by senior management of the bank, son of late Abdul Sattar Edhi Mr. Faisal
Edhi, representatives of financial sector, philanthropists and notables of the society.

Paying tributes to late Abdul Sattar Edhi Governor State Bank said social welfare is no ordinary feat
nor it is impossible to achieve. He said developing countries generally face lack of welfare facilities
and private sector in such countries fills the void. He complemented late Abdul Sattar Edhi for being
among the first ones to come forward for the cause of humanity in the country.

Governor further added, ""though there is no dearth of welfare organizations in this country but late
Edhi stands apart with the rest of organizations as he did not seek elaborate gatherings for fund
raising, rather he depended upon common people of Pakistan for this purpose”. He went on to add
that this approach is symbolic of the philosophy of ‘help yourself’ and understanding pain and
anguish of each other.

Governor recalled that services rendered by Mr. Edhi have been recognized locally as well as
internationally. He felt proud of being a member of Jinnah Society when it conferred upon an award
to Mr. Edhi for his outstanding services. He urged upon the members of financial services, presidents
of commercial banks and other high ranking officials present there to come forward and fully
cooperate with Edhi Foundation and other social welfare organizations under Corporate Social
Responsibility thus enabling them to continue the work of social welfare.

Liaquat Merchant, President, Jinnah Society while recounting services of Edhi Sahab said he was at
the forefront to serve humanity in any eventuality. He added that late Edhi was legend in his life time
and perhaps people like him born in 100 years time.

Chairman, Pakistan Banks Association, Mr. Aftab Manzoor called late Edhi as the greatest
humanitarian and beacon of hope in face of every distress and calamity. He prayed Allah to grant him
the highest place in Jannah.

At the end, son of late Abdul Sattar Edhi, Mr. Faisal Edhi said though Edhi Sahab has gone but his
memories and mission is with us. He said the love extended by people from everywhere to us this
time has no example and prayed that this love and prayers remain with them for the successful
achievement of the mission of Edhi Sahab.

Mr. Faisal Edhi recounted that recently Sikhs, Christians, Hindus as well as Muslims belonging to
various sects were present at the residence/office of late Edhi and all of them prayed together for his
magfirat and success of his mission and said that after seeing them | am sure that his mission cannot
be stopped.

Statement on Keynote address by Governor SBP, Dr Reza Baqir at Pakistan Banking Awards 2019

 

The Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir while giving his keynote address, shared his views
in three areas: the outlook for Pakistan’s economy, areas where banks are doing well, and finally areas
where banks need to do more.

On the outlook for the economy the Governor emphasized that economic policies are addressing
previously accumulated external and fiscal sector imbalances. On the external side, he noted that
imbalances had arisen in the past because a fixed and overvalued exchange rate had widened the
current account to a historically unprecedented monthly deficit of about $2 billion. To address this
external imbalance, exchange rate flexibility and the shift to a market-based exchange rate system in
May 2019 had significantly reduced the current account deficit and led to a notable improvement in FX
reserves, net of borrowing. The Governor drew attention to the fact that Pakistan’s
history demonstrated that low and falling levels of reserves had been the leading cause of
Pakistan’s repeated need to seek financial assistance from international financial institutions and
therefore the best way to avoid such developments in the future was to build and preserve the
country’s reserves. Dr. Baqir noted that preserving the policies of a market-based exchange rate
system and zero lending of the State Bank to the government would help preserve reserves and
therefore strengthen the country’s financial sovereignty. Regarding fiscal imbalances, the Governor
opined that the government had recently demonstrated significant improvement in revenue collection
and was on course to reverse the trend of a growing primary fiscal deficit which would improve the
sovereign’s credit worthiness. The Governor noted that inflation had risen due to depreciation of the
rupee, increases in utility prices and one-off factors related to temporary food supply chain
disruptions. He expressed his confidence that monetary policy was appropriate to bring inflation
down in the coming months and noted that real interest rates were in line with other emerging
market markets and Pakistan’s history.

The Governor observed that there was growing recognition that economic policies are being
successful in addressing previously accumulated imbalances and as a result the outlook for the real
economy was beginning to improve. In this context he observed that due to the deprecation of the
exchange rate, Pakistan’s exports had become competitive viz a viz Pakistan’s competitors which
strengthened the outlook for the export sector. He also pointed to the significant increase in
government development spending outlays which were expected to feed into real activity in
construction and allied sectors in the coming months. Finally, he noted that the business confidence
surveys conducted by IBA and available on the SBP’s web site had shown that after a number of
months of decline, businessmen’s confidence was beginning to improve.

Turning to the performance of the banking sector, Dr. Reza Baqir said that it was encouraging that the
industry’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (17.1%), Leverage Ratio (4.9%), Liquidity Coverage Ratio (170%) and
Net Stable Funding Ratio (150%) are all better than local and international minimum benchmarks.

SBP’s Clarification on misleading press reports regarding
Written-off Loans Published on July 23rd, 2016

The State Bank of Pakistan hereby clarifies that the reports appearing in various sections of the press
on July 23, 2016 regarding “Loans written-off during last 30 years” by Banks/DFl’s are factually
incorrect and misleading.

It is clarified that during the aforesaid period, for amounts of Rs 50 million and above, the total
amount of written-off loans/waiver of mark-up/other charges amounts to Rs. 171 billion and not Rs.
430 billion as reported in the press.

Similarly, during the last 3 years, banks/ DFls written-off loans/ waiver of mark-up/other charges
amounted to Rs. 20 billion and not Rs 280 Billion. The written off amounts are Rs 5.91 billion for 2013,
Rs 4.518 billion for 2014 and Rs 9.815 billion for 2015, quite in contrast to the exaggerated amounts
stated in the press.

The press has reported the banks write-off’s in generic terms without delving into the details of
principal, mark-up and other charges waived off by the banks. Whereas in a large number of cases,
quoted by the press, the amount written off pertains to mark-up and other charges only.

It would be pertinent to mention here that more than 80% of the banking sector operating in Pakistan
is now owned by the private sector and the rest by the public sector which are both duly monitored
and guided by their respective board of directors. The financial institutions, despite their best efforts,
have to write-off some loans which are irrecoverable due to some bonafide business reasons i.e.
adverse business cycle, deteriorated economic conditions, changes in policy, global environment etc.
The writing-off of loans by the banks is a common practice all across the globe and Pakistani banks
are no exception. The banks have to provide for their loan losses under the State Bank of Pakistan
Prudential Regulations and more than 80% of the non performing loans are fully provided for.

Further, as a matter of transparency, banks / DFls disclose the details of written-off loans of Rs. 0.5

million and above in their published Annual Audited Financial Statements.

PRESS RELEASE
KASB BANK: SBP CLARIFICATION

The State Bank of Pakistan as part of its mandate is responsible for protecting the interest of
depositors and ensuring stability of the banking system. Fulfilling its mandated
responsibilities State Bank assesses fitness and propriety of every prospective investor in a
bank beyond a defined threshold (currently 5%), so as to ensure that the investor is capable
of fulfilling the fiduciary responsibilities and can be entrusted with the license to collect
public deposits.

Due to persistent losses for the last five years KASB bank’s equity had eroded significantly
and was much below the regulatory Minimum Capital Requirement, its Capital Adequacy as
of 30-09-2014 has also turned into negative thus technically rendering it insolvent. Because
of the weak financial health of the bank and inability of its sponsors to meet capital
requirement of State Bank, in the best interest of the depositors and other stakeholders, had
to request Federal Government to place the bank under moratorium. The Federal
Government imposed the moratorium on the bank and also directed State Bank to prepare a
scheme of reconstruction / amalgamation in accordance with the law.

The sponsors of the bank filed a writ petition against the State Bank of Pakistan and others at
Islamabad High Court; however, the petition was subsequently withdrawn unconditionally.

State Bank of Pakistan has noticed that post withdrawal of the petition rumors have been
spread that some Chinese investors have struck a deal with State Bank of Pakistan. State
Bank denies any such deal and clarifies that a Chinese investor approached State Bank
through the bank’s existing shareholders. SBP informed the prospective investor to establish
its bonafide and has to clear Fitness and Propriety criteria. They were also guided about the
position of the bank and information required to be submitted in order to assess their
request. However, they could not submit any of the required information. An entity whose
beneficial ownership is not clear cannot be entrusted with the license of a bank.

Although the prospective investor under discussion has indicated to bring in some
investment by May 13, 2015 but in view of the quantum of deposits of the bank and the
Minimum Capital Requirement the committed amount of investment is very meager.
Further, the prospective investor did not share any information about how and from where
the funds would be mobilized.

State Bank of Pakistan, always welcomes the Foreign Direct Investment, however, this can be
accepted only within the bound of laws and regulations prevalent in the jurisdiction. State
Bank of Pakistan reassures the public at large that it is committed to strengthen the banking
sector of the country.

Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra attends FSB meeting in London

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) met in London last week with Mr. Mark Carney, Governor of the
Bank of England, in Chair to discuss current vulnerabilities, ongoing policy work and its work plan for
2017. Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mehmood Wathra represented FSB-Regional Consultative Group
(RCG) of Asia as one of the Co-Chairs. Formed in 2011, the RCG Asia includes central banks and
financial authorities of 16 jurisdictions. Governor SBP (along with Chief Executive Norman Chan of
Hong Kong Monetary Authority) has been the co-chair of the FSB-RCG for Asia effective from July 1,
2015.

The meeting noted that financial system has continued to function well, despite bouts of uncertainty
and risk aversion. Further, the global financial system is more resilient as a result of the regulatory
reforms introduced following the 2008 financial crisis. The FSB emphasized the importance of
completing the implementation of the agreed reform programme, including Basel III.

The FSB, in consultation with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and national authorities, approved the 2016 lists of
identified global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and insurers (G-Slls), which was released on
Monday, November 21, 2016.

The Plenary discussed the implementation to date of the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
standard for banks, and reviewed progress of the work plan enhancing resilience, recovery planning
and resolvability of central counterparties (CCPs). It also discussed the responses received to its
public consultation on proposed policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from
asset management activities, published in June. The FSB will publish the final recommendations by
end-2016.

On correspondent banking (CB), members discussed the draft progress report on the
implementation of the FSB’s four-point action plan to assess and address the reasons for decline in
CB services. The report, which will be released by end-2016, will set out next steps for 2017 to
maintain momentum in tackling this important issue.

The FSB members reviewed updates from the various workstreams to address misconduct in the
financial sector. The Chair of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Michael
Bloomberg and his Special Advisor, Mary Schapiro presented an update to the Plenary on the
industry-led TCFD’s work. The presentation included a summary of the recommended voluntary
disclosures and guidance developed by the TCFD, which will be released for public consultation in
December 2016. The final report will be published by June 2017.

The FSB members, then, discussed the workplan for reporting on the implementation and effects of
G20/ FSB reforms. The FSB members also talked about arrangements for undertaking a
comprehensive review of the implementation and effects of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
reforms as part of this work. They also discussed an interim report by the Committee on the Global
Financial System (CGFS) and its study on repo market liquidity and the impact of possible drivers.
The main findings from both studies will be incorporated in the third annual report to the G20.

The FSB agreed to undertake, by July 2017, an assessment of progress in transforming shadow
banking into resilient market-based finance. This will include an assessment of the evolution of
shadow banking activities since the global financial crisis and related financial stability risks, and
adequacy of the policies and monitoring put in place by FSB members. The Plenary discussed the
preliminary high-level findings from this year’s annual monitoring exercise of the global trends and

SBP enhances loan size under its refinance scheme to support women entrepreneurs

To encourage women participation in the economy, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced
the financing limit under its Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women
Entrepreneurs from Rs1.5 million to Rs5 million. The decision has been taken in light of
feedback received from various stakeholders about current financing limit being insufficient to
cover the financing needs of women entrepreneurs.

This decision is in line with the Government of Pakistan’s policy to support and revive economic
activities in the country and SBP’s key objective of improving access to finance for priority
segments including women entrepreneurs. Initially in August 2017, State Bank had introduced
Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs in underserved areas to
promote financial inclusion and access to finance for women entrepreneurs in the country.
Subsequently, the scope of scheme was enhanced to cover whole of Pakistan. Under this
scheme, SBP provides refinance to participating financial institutions at 0% on their financing
to women entrepreneurs at maximum end user rate of 5%. Moreover, 60% risk coverage is
also available to the participating institutions.

The enhancement in financing limit under SBP scheme is expected to increase financial
inclusion of women since more women entrepreneurs are likely to be attracted for setting up
of new businesses or for expanding the scope of their existing businesses by availing
concessional financing under SBP scheme.

State Bank of Pakistan allows financing for BMR and expansion under its
Temporary Economic Relief Facility

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has opened up it subsidized Temporary Economic Relief Facility (TERF)
for Balancing, Modernization and Replacement (BMR) and expansion of existing projects. This measure
has been taken to provide further stimulus to the economy in the context of COVID-19’s impact on the
economy, to support investment in the country for modernizing or expanding manufacturing /
production units, and in response from feedback from stakeholders.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, SBP has taken several measures to safeguard economic activity in the
country. On March 17, 2020 SBP introduced TERF and its Shariah compliant version to stimulate new
investment in manufacturing sector. Under this scheme, SBP provides refinance to banks for their
onward extension of financing at maximum end-user rate of 7 percent for 10 years. The maximum
financing for a single project under the Scheme is Rs. 5 billion. The objective of this facility is to boost
economic activity through investments in manufacturing units.

While allowing BMR and expansion of existing projects, SBP has allowed financing for purchase of new
imported and locally manufactured plant and machinery against foreign LC and inland LC. The funding
under the facility cannot be used for procurement of second-hand machinery, land or carrying out civil
works. Further, SBP has also introduced additional internal and external checks and controls to ensure
proper utilization of funds. Further details on this measure are available in the SBP circular available at:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL9.htm

With expansion in scope of the facility, SBP expects that existing businesses will avail this subsidized
funding to improve productivity of their business projects leading to higher economic activity and
employment generation.

A complete list of the measures taken by the SBP to support the economy and public health since the
outbreak of COVID-19 is available at: http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp. If end-users would like
further information on these SBP measures in the context of COVID-19 or if they are experiencing issues
with commercial banks in benefiting from these measures, they can contact a dedicated COVID-19 SBP
team by email at covid19.stimulus@sbp.org.pk or by phone at 111-727-273. End-users are encouraged
to review the material available at the above webpage including relevant circulars and any available
FAQs before contacting the SBP for further information.

State Bank, IBA launch

Consumer Confidence Survey Website

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Yaseen Anwar has said that information provided by consumer
confidence survey brings him in touch with the ground realities of Pakistan. He was speaking at the
occasion of the official launch of the IBA-SBP consumer confidence survey website.

Introducing the audience to the IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey, he said that in January 2012,
together with Dr. Ishrat “we inaugurated the Centre for Survey Research (CSR), housed on the 2""
floor of SBP LRC building. In this centre, students and teachers from IBA and SBP officers have
been meeting every other month to collect data on households’ views about various economic
propositions.”

Mr. Anwar said that consumer confidence and inflation expectations reflect the confidence of the
households in the economy. These “expectations regarding inflation, interest rate, stock prices, and
employment are important for policy formulation, which explains why many developed and
developing countries are using consumer surveys for policymaking and research purposes.”

He added that results from these surveys help us study not only the expectations of consumers but also
their reaction to different economic and policy shocks. The information gathered from this exercise is
expected to help in the process of designing a forward-looking monetary policy in the country.

Referring to the moving stories of households suffering from gas shortage and loadshedding, Mr.
Anwar said that the “project provides me an opportunity to get a glimpse into the thought process of
Pakistani households as well as their livelihood.”

According to Mr. Anwar, the impact of the project is indeed much wider in scope than keeping the
policymaker informed about the ground realities of the economy. “We have been increasingly using
the concepts of consumer sentiments and inflation expectations in our flagship publications of annual
and quarterly reports as well as most recently in our Monetary Policy Statements,” he added.

He informed the audience that twelve waves of the survey had been completed. “In each wave, we
surveyed in excess of 1800 households. The sample of households is spread all over Pakistan and
households are chosen randomly from the PTCL directory. Furthermore, the sample is stratified on the
basis of population.”

Mr. Anwar said that the project had been developed in-house but “we have benefitted from our
colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, CIMS at University of Surrey and Yale
University in the form of theoretical background, development and implementation.”

Press Release

Revision of FE-25 Export Loans Policy

The existing foreign exchange regulations allow Authorized Dealers (banks) to use foreign
currency deposits for extending foreign currency trade loan facility to exporters and
importers. These regulations, however, allow settlement of such loans against exports only
through realization of export proceeds or remittances from abroad.

In cases where export proceeds were not realized for any reason including non-performance
of export contracts or circumstances leading to cancellation of export contracts after partial
performance etc., such loans remained unsettled. Resultantly, Authorized Dealers were
constrained to retain the above foreign exchange liabilities on their books of accounts.

In order to address these difficulties and to facilitate exporters/Authorized Dealers, the State
Bank has relaxed the existing policy regarding settlement of subject outstanding loans
against exports by delegating powers to Authorized Dealers to settle outstanding export
loans valuing upto USD 50,000/- (or equivalent in other foreign currencies) themselves
through interbank market. The settlement of outstanding loans exceeding the above limit
shall, however, require prior approval of the State Bank.

Strong Growth in Digital Financial Transactions in the country in Q1 FY2020/21
Key Highlights

e During Q1-FY21, the number of registered mobile phone banking users reached 8.9 million
showing an increase of 41% over Q1-FY20 and the number of internet users of bank websites
reached 4.3 million with a growth of 26% over the same period

e Mobile banking transactions increased to 36.4 million amounting to Rs. 908.7 billion, marking
an increase of 139% by volume and 211% by value when compared with the same period last
year

e Internet banking transactions increased to 18.9 million, valuing Rs. 1.1 trillion during Q1-FY21,
registering a growth of 55% in volume and 89% in value, in comparison to the same period last
year

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Quarterly Payment System Review (QPSR) for the first quarter,
July — September 2020, of the fiscal year 2020-21 today, which shows strong growth in the pace of
digital financial transactions in the country.

Promoting digital financial services is a key goal of the SBP. According to the data reported in the
review, digital payment transactions in Pakistan have increased significantly during Q1-FY21, largely
due to the impact of measures taken by SBP creating incentives for customers. Growth in digital
payment infrastructure as well as emergence of new payment aggregators have also been a
contributing factor in this growth. Moreover, it also reflects the changes in consumer’s preference for
digital transactions amid Covid19 situation.

According to the Q1-FY21 QPSR, 253.7 million e-Banking transactions were conducted by customers
valuing Rs. 19 trillion. E-banking transactions comprise Real-Time Online Branches (RTOBs)
Transactions, ATM Transactions, Internet Banking Transactions, Mobile Phone Banking Transactions, e-
commerce, POS, and Call Center/ IVR Banking. Although, RTOB transactions have a major share of e-
banking transactions in terms of value, about 80%, other types of transactions are more than 83% of
the e-banking transactions in terms of volume. During Q1-FY21, the most promising uptake was seen
in internet banking and mobile banking transactions as the number of registered mobile phone banking
users reached 8.9 million showing an increase of 41% over Q1-FY20 and the number of internet users
touched 4.3 million with a growth of 26% over the same period. Accordingly, the mobile banking
transactions increased to 36.4 million amounting to Rs. 908.7 billion, marking an increase of 139% by
volume and 211% by value when compared with the same period last year. Similarly, internet banking
transactions increased to 18.9 million, valuing Rs. 1.1 trillion during Q1-FY21, registering a growth of
55% in volume and 89% in value, in comparison to the same period last year.

Another major avenue of e-banking transactions is through Point of Sale (POS), whereby people make
transactions using credit or debit cards typically for shopping at markets. The number of transactions
through POS machines that declined sharply during Q3 and Q4 of FY20, owing to the closure of markets
amid Covid19, recovered significantly in Q1-FY21. The number of transactions through POS were
recorded at 16.8 million amounting to Rs. 92.3 billion, showing an increase of 47% in terms of volume
and 49% in value during Q1-FY21 over Q4-FY20. In addition to POS based transactions, card based

Governor SBP Welcomes Change in Moody’s Outlook and Recent Market Developments

Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, welcomed Moody’s change in outlook on Pakistan from
negative to stable. He noted that this positive development reflects the recognition of tough
decisions taken by the economic policymakers over recent months including the step
devaluations of the exchange rate that culminated in the change in the exchange rate regime
to a market based system since May 2019. These steps have made our exports competitive,
curbed expensive imports and given an incentive to domestic industries to compete with
imports, and resulted in a sustained improvement in the current account which has been the
key driver of the increase in SBP’s reserves net of liabilities. The increase in the stock market
is also a reflection of the improving market sentiment and a growing reflection that the
country’s finances are on a sustainable footing.

The Governor also emphasized that while such market developments are welcome, it is
critical to ensure that the emerging financial improvements are translated into real gains for
the middle and lower income classes. These sections of the society have borne the bulk of
the burden of adjustments from higher income taxes deducted at source for salaried
workers, higher indirect taxes, and higher inflation. Rising inflation has partly been the result
of the need to restore competitiveness in the exchange rate, increased administered prices
to reduce fiscal deficits in the public sector, and unforeseen food supply disruptions. The
structural constraints on private investment, as reflected in ease-of-doing business
indicators, have to be addressed further to stimulate private job creation and eventually
raise incomes. Furthermore, it is equally important to address food supply disruptions and
curtail hoarding in food markets to bring down prices. The Governor emphasized that
coordinated work in these areas is critical to ensure that the strengthening market sentiment
translates into improving the livelihood of the people, particularly in the middle and lower
income brackets.

STATE BANK ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO
FURTHER STRENGTHEN CAPITAL BASE OF BANKS

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to raise the Minimum Paid up Capital of
Banks and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) in a phased manner over next four
years from the existing Rs. 2 billion to Rs. 6 billion by 31° December, 2009 to
strengthen the solvency of Pakistani banks. The banks will be required to raise their
Minimum Paid up Capital (net of losses) to Rs.3 billion, 4 billion, 5 billion and 6 billion
by 31% December, 2006, 2007, 2008 & 2009 respectively.

The State Bank has also replaced the existing uniform requirement of Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) with the variable CAR to be based on risk ratings of the banks
determined by the State Bank annually. While the minimum required CAR for category 1
& 2 banks will continue to be 8%, the banks in category 3 will have to meet the CAR of
10%, those in category 4 CAR of 12% and Category 5 banks 14% by December 31,
2006.

The new minimum capital and capital adequacy ratio requirements of banks/DFIs
have been finalized in consultation with the Pakistan Banks Association. These changes
which will be effective from 31° December, 2005 have been introduced to prepare the
banks/DFIs for implementation of Basel-II as also to further strengthen the soundness and
stability of the banking system.

The branches of foreign banks operating in Pakistan will also be required to
increase their assigned capital to Rs 6 billion within the above timelines prescribed for
the locally incorporated banks/DFIs. However, those branches of foreign banks whose
Head Offices hold a minimum paid up capital of US $ 100 million (net of losses) and
have a CAR of 9% (determined as per Basel-I or Basel-II Accord) can be allowed to
continue to maintain the minimum assigned capital of Rs 2 billion (net of losses). All
such branches of foreign banks shall, however, be required to seek specific permission
from the State Bank to maintain the minimum assigned capital (net of losses) of Rs 2
billion effective from 31st December, 2005.

The required minimum paid up capital as well as CAR can be achieved by the
banks/DFIs either by fresh capital injection or retention of profits.

Any bank/DFI that fails to meet the minimum paid up capital requirement or CAR
within the stipulated period shall render itself liable to the following actions:

* Imposition of such restrictions on its business including restrictions on acceptance
of deposits and lending as may be deemed fit by the State Bank.

¢ Descheduling of the bank, thereby converting it into a non-scheduled bank.

¢ Cancellation of the banking license if the State Bank believes that the bank is not
in a position to meet the minimum paid up capital requirement or CAR.

SME finance by banking industry achieves historic high of over half-a-trillion rupees

SME financing by banks in Pakistan has first time crossed the milestone of Rs 500 billion. SME
financing was recorded at Rs 513 billion at the end of CY 2018 compared to Rs 450 billion in
the corresponding period last year, exhibiting growth of 14 percent. The growth in SME
financing was even more prominent in the last six months of CY 2018 (July-Dec, 2018) wherein
it registered an increase of 25 percent.

This increase in SME financing attracts greater significance keeping in view the fact that SBP
policy rate during CY 2018 witnessed a rising trend. Due to continued focus of State Bank for
facilitating SMEs access to formal sources of finance, SME financing increased significantly
during CY 2018. The substantial increase in SME financing is mainly attributable to
implementation of the policy for promotion of SME finance issued by the State Bank of
Pakistan in December 2017.

The SME policy ensured provision of enabling regulatory environment for SME finance,
prescribing SME financing targets for banks/DFls, sensitizing banks to adopt SME financing as
a viable business proposition, advising banks to provide non-financial advisory services for
making SMEs bankable, simplifying procedures for SME financing and introduction of new SBP
refinance schemes for SMEs through banks/DFls. Under the policy so far more than 2,500
bankers have been trained through focused trainings by the training institute of the central
bank. Similarly, awareness has also been created among more than 20,000 stakeholders
including SMEs through special programs held by SBP and SBP BSC all across the country.

The impact of SBP interventions resulted into significant rise in outstanding SME finance by
banks/DFls coupled with 2.3 percent decrease in non-performing SME portfolio of banks over
last year. It is pertinent to mention that Government of Pakistan is also providing all out
support to promote SME sector. The substantial tax incentives to the banks on their
incremental financing to SMEs announced in recent economic reforms bill is in line with
measures identified in government’s 100-day agenda for development of SME sector. This will
continue to encourage banks to fulfill the financing needs of SMEs.

It is worth mentioning that SME sector is contributing 30 percent towards country’s GDP,
employ more than 80 percent of non-agricultural workforce and generate 25 percent in export
earnings. Thus, SME sector has huge potential for employment generation and poverty
alleviation.

Monetary Policy Statement
April 09, 2016

After bottoming out in September 2015, both the Year-on-Year (YoY) headline CPI and
period average inflation are on a rising trend. While the YoY inflation rose from 1.3
percent in September 2015 to 3.9 percent in March 2016, the period average inflation
increased from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent during this period. Similarly, the YoY core
inflation measures kept their increasing trends; Non Food-Non Energy increased for the
fifth consecutive month and the Trimmed Mean for the third month. Nevertheless, this
rise in inflation was anticipated and the benign inflation outlook for the remaining
months of FY16 remains largely unchanged.

However, these trends in inflation indicate pickup in aggregate demand, amid both
improved security situation and real incomes. This is reflected in rising demand for
consumer durables, acceleration in construction activities, and expansion in services
sector. Further, uptick in credit to private sector, mainly owing to lower cost of
borrowing, also supports this. Continuing increase in fixed investments for the fifth
quarter remains noteworthy. With positive consumer sentiments and incremental
lending rates at considerably lower levels, the uptake in credit to private sector is
expected to end FY16 on a higher level than that of FY15.

At the same time, with improved business sentiments, lower input prices, and better
energy availability, supply conditions have improved as well. Largely contributed by
automobile, cement, and fertilizer sectors, large-scale manufacturing grew by 4.1
percent in Jul-Jan FY16, compared to 2.5 percent growth in Jul-Jan FY15. The improving
large-scale manufacturing and industrial growth trends are expected to continue
despite sector specific issues in steel, paper and board, and sluggish textile sector.
Furthermore, excess stock of major food items and the February 2016 pass-on of lower
oil prices to domestic consumers are expected to keep downward pressure on inflation.
This is also corroborated by a decline in inflation expectations in the latest wave of IBA-
SBP consumer confidence survey.

In line with these developments, both money and foreign exchange markets exhibited
relative tranquility in recent months. The cushion provided by decline in oil prices,
inflow of remittances, and calmer international capital markets improved sentiments in
the foreign exchange market. As a result, in post January 2016 monetary policy period,
PKR has remained stable in the interbank market.

SBP allows Sindh Microfinance Bank Limited
to commence its operations in the Sindh Province

The State Bank of Pakistan has allowed Sindh Microfinance Bank Limited to
commence microfinance banking business at provincial level in the Province of Sindh.
Earlier, the SBP had issued a license to the Microfinance Bank.

Sindh Microfinance Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sindh Bank Limited, now
becomes the 11"" Microfinance Bank to operate in the country. In Pakistan, nine (9)
Microfinance Banks are already operating on nation-wide basis whereas one MFB is
operating at province level.

The commencement of business of Sindh Microfinance Bank Ltd. will result in a
significant increase in the market share of regulated microfinance banks (MFBs) within the
overall microfinance sector. This will also lead to the increased provision of inclusive micro-
finance and related financial services to the less-privileged and unbanked segments of the
society. It is expected that Sindh Microfinance Bank Ltd will contribute towards poverty
alleviation as per the mandate under the Microfinance Institution Ordinance, 2001.

Consumers’ confidence on Pakistan’s economy improves: CC Survey

 

The results of the latest Consumer Confidence Survey, conducted during September 5 to 9,
2017 show that, in general, consumers’ confidence on Pakistan’s economy has increased. The
overall Consumer Confidence Index increased by 5.07 percent compared to the previous
survey, held in July 2017. The improvement in consumer confidence is reflected in the increase
in Current Economic Conditions Index as well as Expected Economic Conditions Index.
Moreover, the index, showing inflation expectations also increased by 2.6 percent during this

period.

It may be recalled that State Bank of Pakistan is regularly conducting Consumer Confidence
surveys through telephonic calls to consumers that are selected randomly across the country.
These surveys are conducted after every two months and provide information on “what people
are thinking” about current and future economic conditions, future trends in inflation, interest
rates, unemployment, and their household income. Such information are helpful in the

monetary policy formulation.

For complete report of the survey, please access SBP website at:

Pakistan ranked among top five countries in the Global Index on Financial Inclusion 2015

Pakistan’s financial inclusion ranking has been elevated to number 5 in the Global Index on Financial
Inclusion, two notches up from the 2014 ranking as revealed by the Economist Intelligence Unit’s
(EIU) Global Microscope 2015 Report.

The EIU Report attributed the improvement in Pakistan’s ranking to the top level commitment,
consistency, and major financial inclusion initiatives implemented by State Bank of Pakistan during
the year. It particularly pinned Pakistan’s financial inclusion progress on a very well documented and
articulated National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), policy on Asaan Accounts, passage of Credit
Bureau Act, membership of global Better Than Cash Alliance, and Financial Literacy Initiatives. The
report also highlights some key challenges facing Pakistan in NFIS implementation including the
constrained supply of credit to underserved markets, deficiency in land titling and registration, the
absence of a secured transaction framework and electronic collateral registry for movable assets, and
lack of capacity in both financial institutions and clients. It is important to mention that NFIS has
already prioritized these challenges and will build momentum to push forward reforms to achieve
universal financial inclusion in an integrated and sustained manner.

The Global Microscope Report 2015 assesses the regulatory environment for financial inclusion across
12 indicators and 55 countries. The country rankings are based on their progress and commitment to
financial inclusion, regulatory and supervisory environment, market infrastructure and financial
stability etc. Microscope 2015 is directed towards practitioners, policymakers, investors, and other
stakeholders in the area of financial inclusion to help drive financial inclusion through their respective
roles.

Finance Minister visits SBP and addresses Banks Presidents

Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue, Economic Affair,
Statistics & Privatization, has stated that economic parameters have recorded significant
improvement over the last three years and it is time to accelerate the growth momentum of the
economy. He was addressing the Presidents of Banks in a meeting held at State Bank of Pakistan,
Karachi. He highlighted that the foreign exchange reserve position of the country has improved
significantly over the last three years and appreciated the role of SBP and banks in this improvement.

He mentioned further that going further reserves will improve further and by the end of the fiscal
year may touch US dollar 23 billion. “We are expecting another USS 1 billion from IFls in the coming
week,” he said. Appreciating the contribution of home remittances, the Minister lauded the role of
banks in it. He disclosed that with respect to the reimbursement of TT changes, the government will
release Rs 3 billion from the budgeted allocation of 2015-16.

The Finance Minister that it is the first time Pakistan will complete IMF Macro-economic Stabilization
Program. Despite several hurdles it is the first time in the history of Pakistan that the country has
completed maximum reforms under the program, he said. Adding further he said that Pakistan is not
intending to go to another IMF program.

While elaborating the fiscal improvements, he stated that the budget deficit has improved to 4.3%
from 8.8% three years ago without compromising on development budget. The process of fiscal
consolidation continuous to lower the deficit going forward. “As a consequence government’s
borrowing requirements from the banking system are reduced and therefore creating space for the
banks to lend to the private sector, the Finance Minister remarked.

He urged banks to take advantage of this space and increase credit to the private sector particularly
to the SME and microfinance sectors as well as to the housing sector. To promote mortgage financing
in the country, he stressed importance of having foreclosure law and said that without such laws
housing finance could not be promoted.

FM lauded SBP efforts in the financial sector. He said monetary policy has played a great role in
achieving economic turnaround. Further, he said SBP efforts with regard to financial inclusion have
earned international recognition.

Earlier, the Governor SBP, Ashraf Mahmood Wathra welcomed the Finance Minister. “We are
grateful that you took time out of your busy schedule, as we all know that Dar sb. has been
shouldering various other responsibilities besides his own portfolio in recent times.

SBP Eases Cash Margin Restriction on Imports

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has eased 100 percent cash margin requirement on the import of
certain raw materials to support manufacturing and industrial sectors and further enhance their
capacity to contribute towards the recovery of the economy in post COVID-19 era.

The cash margin condition was initially imposed in 2017 on 404 HS Codes and later in 2018 ona further
131 items, with a view to contain the import of mostly consumer goods and to allow room for the
import of more growth-inducing items.

Considering the challenges posed by the COVID-19 to the manufacturing sector and other economic
segments, and on the representations made by various businesses and associations, the SBP re-
evaluated the cash margin requirements and decided to remove this requirement on 106 items/HS
Codes. For details: https://www.sbp.org.pk/bprd/2020/CL43.htm

The removal of the cash margin requirements on these items will support businesses’ cash flows and
liquidity, by freeing up funds previously held with the banks under cash margin against imports, and
route these funds towards avenues of growth and development that will benefit the economy.

The SBP remains committed to facilitate industries and businesses in contributing to the growth and
development of the country, and is ready to take any further actions required to support the overall
manufacturing and industrial activity.

Monetary Policy Statement
Match 17, 2020

1. At its meeting on 17 March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the policy rate
by 75 bps to 12.50 percent. The decision reflected the MPC’s view that the outlook for inflation has
improved in light of the recent deceleration in domestic food prices, significant decline in consumer price
expectations, sharp fall in global oil prices, and slowdown in external and domestic demand due to the
Coronavirus pandemic. Average headline inflation is expected to remain within the SBP’s 11-12 percent
forecast in FY20, before falling to the medium-term target range of 5-7 somewhat earlier than previously

forecast.

2. In addition to its decision on interest rates, the MPC noted that the SBP’s new “I'emporary Economic
Refinancing Facility (TERF)’ for businesses—that provides SBP refinancing for bank lending for plant and
machinery for new projects at 7.0 percent fixed for 10 years—should provide important additional support to
investment in response to the anticipated slowdown in activity due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

3. ‘The MPC emphasized that it stood ready to take further actions if and when needed as more information
becomes available on the outlook for inflation and growth.

4. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

5. The MPC noted that the dominant development since the last meeting on 28"" January 2020 has been the
outbreak of the Coronavirus, which has taken a significant toll on human life around the world. The outbreak
has reduced external and domestic demand, while increasing risk aversion and uncertainty about the future.
At the same time global oil prices have plummeted which, if sustained, should help lower domestic inflation
and improve the current account. Heightened global risk aversion has recently reduced demand for emerging
market assets across the world, and has led to some volatility and depreciation in the domestic foreign
exchange market in the past few days, as in other emerging markets. The MPC emphasized that the current
market volatility is externally driven and the strengthening in the fundamentals of Pakistan's economy that
drove the improvement in Pakistan markets before the Coronavirus outbreak remains intact. As a result, they
viewed that the volatility in the domestic markets would likely subside once global tisk aversion reduces and
country-specific fundamentals regain importance. The MPC also noted that a staff-level agreement with the
IMF on the second review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) was successfully reached, which will
support investor sentiment.

Real sector

6. Recent high-frequency indicators re-affirmed that the decline in most economic sectors was bottoming-
out before the Coronavirus outbreak. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) rebounded strongly in December
2019, moving into positive growth (9.7 percent y/y) for the first time in the last six months, and indicated
strengthening in a growing number of industries, especially export-oriented ones. Notwithstanding some
improvement relative to last year, agricultural growth is likely to be lower than previously forecast.

Seminar on Managing Crises in Emerging Markets

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) hosted a seminar on “Managing Crises in Emerging Markets” in
collaboration with the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) in Karachi yesterday. The seminar was
attended by policy makers, financial sector specialists, researchers, government officials, heads of
commercial banks, eminent business persons, academics, and the media.

In his welcoming remarks, the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, stated that the objective of holding the
seminar was two-fold. First, to demonstrate that, in addition to its mandate of formulating monetary,
exchange rate and financial stability policies, SBP endeavors to facilitate constructive debate on
economic issues and is open to diverse points of view. Second, to highlight that Pakistan is not unique
and there are many other emerging economies that have also faced economic crises and undergone
difficult adjustments.

Mr. Athanasios Arvanitis, Deputy Director of the International Monetary Fund, delivered the keynote
speech. His speech was followed by a panel discussion in which Mr. Ehsan Malik, CEO of PBC, Mr.
Sakib Sherani, CEO of Macro Economic Insights and Mr. Khurram Husain, a renowned journalist at
Dawn, participated. The seminar ended with a question and answer session with the audience.

In his address, Mr. Arvanitis highlighted some of the main similarities of crises across emerging
markets, notably the role typically played by elevated levels of debt, high public and external deficits,
inflexible exchange rates, lack of competitiveness, low saving and investment, and maturity and
currency mismatches. Despite these similarities, he emphasized that there was no one-size-fits-all
model for managing crises. Instead, the IMF focuses on different dimensions while assisting a country
in developing a homegrown stabilization program. The approach emphasizes the need to diagnose
the roots of a country’s crisis, trends and developments in the balance sheets of various economic
agents and their interconnectedness, and country-specific dynamics that affect the political economy
of reforms. In terms of designing stabilization programs, Mr. Arvanitis stressed the importance of
country ownership and measures to provide support for vulnerable segments of the population. He
also drew parallels for Pakistan from the experiences of managing crises in other emerging countries.

Referring to the IMF program with Pakistan, Mr. Arvanitis remarked that it is important for the
government to focus on meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the UN’s 2030
Agenda. He noted that ongoing fiscal reforms will not only put Pakistan’s public debt path ona
sustainable footing but also build the foundation for providing crucial funding to meet these targets.

In the panel discussion, Mr. Ehsan Malik presented the business community’s perspective on
prevailing economic conditions and policies in Pakistan. While complimenting SBP’s adoption of a
market-based exchange rate mechanism and the improving security situation in Pakistan, he
highlighted the skewed tax burden on the manufacturing sector and the need to put in place a
national tariff policy that prioritizes industrial promotion in the country instead of revenue
generation. Mr. Malik also highlighted the business community's concerns about the level of interest
rates in the country.

Mr. Sakib Sherani highlighted various factors that he felt explained why Pakistan’s economic growth
has historically not been steered towards a balanced trajectory despite the implementation of
multiple IMF programs. In particular, he drew attention to the under-appreciation of initial conditions
and negative feedback loops while designing these programs. He agreed with the idea of adopting

Exchange rate likely to remain stable in inter-bank market

SBP computations indicate that there is no fundamental misalignment of the real effective
exchange rate of the rupee and therefore, consistent with recent trends, the exchange rate
will remain stable in the inter-bank market. The SBP believes that stability in the
exchange rate has proved to be, and will remain, important to ensure macroeconomic
stability and to attract investment in the country.

This view is based on the substantial improvement in the country’s economic

performance and better investment climate. This has boosted investor confidence (leading
to higher non-debt creating flows into the economy, including remittances and FDI) as
well as the country’s ability to borrow from international markets at relatively favorable
terms. As a result, Pakistan’s external financing prospects will remain favorable for
several years. This is also acknowledged in the recent IMF Report on Article IV
Consultations with Pakistan in 2006.

Consistent with its stance, the SBP believes that it is important for macroeconomic
stability to contain excessive demand growth in the economy, and therefore remains
committed to maintaining a tight monetary posture. A decline in domestic inflation,
consequent to the tight monetary policy, will be crucial in improving the competitiveness
of Pakistan’s exports and reducing current account imbalances.

State Bank sets Rs 250 Blin agri credit target for FY09

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan said today that the central
bank has set an indicative credit disbursement target of Rs 250 billion for the agriculture
sector for the current 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9) which can be further enhanced after
having a detailed analysis of the rising input costs of the sector.

While chairing a meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi, Dr Akhtar commended the performance of
banks that played a significant role in surpassing the target set for the last fiscal year.

Dr Akhtar informed the meeting that in 2007-08 banks have surpassed the
agriculture credit target of Rs 200 billion and disbursed Rs 212 billion to the farming
community which is higher by Rs 43 billion or 25% than the last year’s disbursement of
Rs 169 billion.

She said that keeping in view the growing requirements of the sector, the State
Bank has proposed an indicative target of Rs 250 billion for 2008-09, which is higher by
Rs 50 billion or 25% than last year’s target and Rs 38 billion or 18% higher than the
actual disbursements of FY08.

Dr Akhtar appreciated the fact that sector-wise agriculture credit disbursements
during the last fiscal year showed diversification of the credit to non-farm sector as its
share in the total credit disbursement increased to 25% in FY08 from 17% in FYO7. She
pointed out that recoveries of agriculture loans have shown significant improvement
during FY08 and banks recovered 92% of their recoverable amounts as against 83%
recovered during FYO7.

While responding to questions posed by representatives of three less developed
provinces on lower disbursement of agriculture loans to their respective provinces, the
SBP Governor said that the banks are making efforts which have resulted in increase in
the disbursements during the last couple of years. Delegates pointed out that there are
issues of credit absorption in these provinces because of low productivity, water salinity,
lack of good farming practices by the farmers and other issues that need to be
addressed by various provincial agriculture and extension services departments to
create enabling environment for banks to increase their outreach.

Dr Akhtar urged the representatives of the three provincial governments to take
necessary steps to address these issues and improve the coordination between
respective departments on fast-track basis to increase the flow of agriculture credit to
the less developed areas of the country.

Banks surpass Agricultural Credit Target: Rs.516 billion disbursed in FY15

Banks have surpassed the agricultural credit disbursement target set by SBP’s Agricultural Credit
Advisory Committee (ACAC) for the year ending June 2015. Against the indicative target of Rs 500
billion (which was 28% higher than the actual agri credit disbursement of Rs.391 Billion in FY14),
banks have disbursed Rs 515.9 billion, which is Rs 15.9 billion in excess of the target set for FY15 and
31.8% higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs 391.4 billion. Growth was also recorded in the
agri. outstanding portfolio which stands at Rs 335.2 billion at end June, 2015 showing an increase of
Rs.45 Billion (up 15.5%) compared with the last year position of Rs 290.3 billion.

The agri. credit target of Rs.500 billion in FY15 (28% growth) was ambitious by any standards, given
the higher risk perception of banks about agri. financing and volatility in the prices of agri. produce.
Nonetheless, SBP adopted a multipronged strategy for achieving the target which included;
sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing as a viable business line, diversification of agri. lending
portfolio of banks, increase in per acre credit limits and extending the scope of eligible items,
development of new product eco-system including value chain financing, and inclusion of
Microfinance and Islamic banks for small and faith sensitive clients. Further, for deepening agri.
financing outreach, Fast Track Lending Program was launched during the year for farm and non-farm
activities in selected districts of the country. In addition, farmers’ awareness and financial literacy
programs were conducted at grass root level.

It is pertinent to mention that the agricultural credit targets have continuously been surpassed since
FY 2011-12 with an average real growth of 10.8% as compared with 3% growth in agriculture GDP for
the same period.

In addition to achieving the indicative agri credit target, SBP implemented all the budgetary
initiatives and projects in collaboration with banks during the year. These include enhancement of
the scope of Crop Loan Insurance up to 25 acres, rollout of Livestock Insurance for small farmers,
launch of Credit Guarantee Scheme for small and marginalized farmers, introduction of Warehouse
Receipts Financing and loans for solar tube-wells, etc.

These achievements were made possible because of the support of government and leadership of
the Governor, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Deputy Governor, Mr. Saeed Ahmad through
conducting regular meetings of ACAC and performance review of banks.

A detailed review of banks’ performance for 2014-15 reveals that five major banks collectively
disbursed agri. loans of Rs 262.9 billion or 104.1% of their annual target of Rs 252.5 billion which is
higher by 34.5% from Rs 195.5 billion disbursed during the corresponding period last year. Amongst
the five major banks, HBL has achieved 113 % of its annual target, MCB achieved 102.6%, UBL
101.4%, ABL 101.2% and NBP achieve 100.1 % of its individual annual target. Among specialized
banks, ZTBL disbursed Rs 95.8 billion or 106.5% of its annual target of Rs 90.0 billion while PPCBL has
disbursed Rs 10.5 billion achieving 91.2% against its target of Rs 11.5 billion during FY 2014-15.

Fifteen Domestic Private Banks as a group achieved 94.1% of its target. Within this group Faysal
bank, Bank Alfalah, JS bank, Bank of Khyber, Bank of Punjab and Standard Chartered Bank were the
top performers surpassing their allocated annual targets. However, Summit bank achieved 99.6%,

Monetary Policy Statement
May 20, 2017

Real GDP growth in FY17 is provisionally estimated at 5.3 percent representing a 10 year high.
Specifically, the revival of domestic demand has been instrumental in the current upturn. The major
thrust has come from the ongoing public and private investment particularly in infrastructure and
power sector. Furthermore, consumer spending has also expanded with a stable inflationary
environment and banks’ renewed interest in consumer financing. On the supply side, recovery in
major crops from last year, better energy supplies, and a broad based increase in Large-scale
Manufacturing have facilitated this expansion.

With further improvement in economic activity along with pass through of the recovering global oil
prices to domestic motor fuel cost, headline CPI inflation has also edged up in recent months. Going
forward in FY18, current trends of rising income, surge in imports, and accelerating credit to private
sector are expected to increase the CPI inflation; however, it is likely to remain within the target.

The upbeat economic sentiments and low interest rates have encouraged the private sector to
undertake capacity expansions. Private sector credit posted a net expansion of Rs 503 billion during
Jul-Apr FY17, which is significantly higher than the uptick of Rs 334 billion in the corresponding
period of last year. This was led by an increase in both the working capital and fixed investment
loans; whereas, consumer financing also maintained the uptrend seen in the past few months.
Notably, the credit flow to private businesses remained broad-based with major impetus from textile
& garments, chemicals, sugar, construction, and power sectors. In tandem with the expansion in the
economic activity, private sector credit uptake is expected to continue in FY18.

The supply of credit remained at ease because of the healthy growth in bank deposits and
government's reliance on central bank financing along with net retirement to commercial banks.
Also, calibrated open market operations by the SBP to manage residual liquidity demand played its
part, besides keeping the overnight repo rate generally close to the policy rate. Reflecting these
developments, money supply (M2) grew by 13.8 percent (YoY) in Apr FY17as compared to 13.0
percent (YoY) during the same month last year.

The expansion in economic activity has led to a concomitant surge in import payments during Jul-
Apr FY17. On the other hand, exports have posted only a marginal recovery; whereas, workers’
remittances also slowed down this year mainly owing to the changing labor market dynamics in the
GCC region. All these factors led to a sharp widening of the current account deficit during Jul-Apr
FY17, compared to the same period last year. As the financial inflows did not entirely cover the
current account imbalance, the overall balance of payments turned into deficit from a surplus in the
same period last year.

Going forward, official inflows are expected to provide support to foreign exchange reserves. A
sustained increase in other private inflows - foreign direct investments and export earnings in
particular - is required to fully finance the surge in imports. In this regard, accompanied with
expected improvements in global demand, the current composition of imports, mainly machinery,
bodes well for the future economic activities. Furthermore, the current growth momentum led by
CPEC related investments is likely to boost foreign direct investment inflows.

Keeping these factors in view, the Monetary Policy Committee of SBP has decided to keep the policy
rate unchanged at 5.75 percent.

Governor SBP visited Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Dr. Reza Baqir visited Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry
(LCCI) today on the invitation of the Chamber. Governor SBP chaired asession with the officials and
members of the chamber in which he talked at length about initiatives & efforts of SBP to promote
economicgrowth inthe country and provide liquidity and other support during COVID. The Governor
was accompanied by Deputy Governor Sima Kamil and other senior officials of SBP.

Governor’s address traversed many themes. From the outset he thanked the President LCCI Mr. Tariq
Misbah for inviting him to visit LCCI. He then went on to talk about the COVID — 19 challenges and the
need for rapid response especially to protect the vulnerable segments of the society. He said that SBP
tooka number of steps to mitigate the impact of COVID — 19 on economicgrowth. Since the onset of
pandemic-related economic pressure, SBP reduced policy rate from 13.25 percent to 7 percent, he

SBP Governor explains Currency Swap Agreement
with Peoples Bank of China

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar today issued the following
press statement to explain the Currency Swap Agreement with Peoples Bank of China:

‘On December 23, 2011, the undersigned signed a landmark Currency Swap Agreement
(CSA) with the Peoples Bank of China (PBC) in Islamabad in the presence of the Prime
Minister of Pakistan and the State Councilor of the Peoples Republic of China. This
agreement represents a significant achievement for both governments in promoting and
enhancing not only bilateral trade, but also the opportunity to significantly increase
investment in Pakistan going forward.

Given the numerous questions or misconceptions one might have and the potential of not
realizing the significant direct and indirect benefits of this lamdmark agreement, I would like
to highlight the features of the CSA and its modus operandi.

The CSA has been executed for a tenor of 3 years in respective local currencies, Pakistan
Rupee 140 Billion and Chinese Yuan 10 Billion. This is the second Currency Swap
Arrangement that State Bank of Pakistan has signed, the first one being with the Central Bank
of Turkey on November 1, 2011.

While these are strictly bilateral arrangements, the precise terms and conditions of each of
these CSAs are confidential between the two Central Banks; however, a close scrutiny of the
information available in the public domain indicates that the principal objective of these
swaps is to promote the use of regional currencies for trade settlement purposes and
specifically in the case of China, it is to enhance the role of the Chinese Yuan in international
trade and investment. China’s concurrent Yuan local currency settlement program is also
consistent with the underlying currency swap objectives. The latest CSA between Pakistan
and China also reflects similar objectives of promoting trade and investment in bilateral
currencies.

Objectives & Structure of CSA:
The objective of the swap is to 1) promote bilateral trade, 2) finance direct investment

between the two countries in the respective local currencies of the two countries and 3) any
other ‘purpose’ as mutually agreed between the two central banks.

Since the CSA is a bi-lateral financial transaction, all terms & conditions apply equally to
both countries and the pricing is based on standard market benchmarks which are widely
acceptable in the respective domestic markets of the two countries. The following are more
details on the structure of the transaction:

1. Both Central Banks will have the ability to draw on the swap line any time during the
tenor of the swap.

2. SBP can purchase CNY from PBC against its local currency (PKR), and repurchase its
local currency with the same CNY on a predetermined maturity date and exchange rate.
Similarly PBC can also purchase PKR against CNY. Standard market pricing will apply

SBP Governor forms Special Committee to devise
strategy for growth of agricultural credit

Mr. Shahid H Kardar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has constituted a Special
Committee which will devise a strategy in consultation with the Federal and Provincial
Governments and other stakeholders for the growth of the agricultural credit in the country.

While chairing a meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held at
the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this morning, Mr. Kardar said that the Committee would
consist of representatives from the State Bank, commercial banks, agri. chambers and
associations. He said that the Committee would hold meaningful discussions at the Federal and
Provincial level to formulate a holistic strategy for the development of agricultural credit with
the consensus of all the major stakeholders.

The Committee will be headed by Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Executive Director,
Development Finance Group of SBP while Mr. Mansoor Hassan Siddiqui, Director SME Finance
Department of the State Bank, Mr. Ziaullah Khan, Senior Executive Vice President, Agriculture
Group, National Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Abid Sattar, Head Retail and Consumer Group, Habib
Bank Limited, Mr. Farooq Abid Tung, Executive Vice-President and Country Head, Agriculture,
Askari Commercial Bank, Mr. Mansoor Arifeen, CEO Icepak Ltd., Mr. Sultan Barg, Chief
Executive Specialists Group Inc./farmer and Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar of Sindh Agriculture
Chamber would be members of the committee.

Mr. Kardar urged the banks to understand the needs of the economy and improve their
penetration in the sector, as it is commercially viable offering attractive potential cash flows
and extensive backward and forward linkages in the value chain. “Banks need to develop a
comprehensive agricultural finance policy, dedicated human resource, simplified procedures
and other prerequisites for building lending portfolios and timely provision of credit to
farmers,” he added.

He said that the Federal & Provincial governments, revenue departments, farmers’
associations and other stakeholders also need to contribute to value addition of the sector
through automation of land records, marketing & storage channels, introduction of latest
farming techniques, efficient extension services, water management, etc. to facilitate the banks
in their endeavour to expand agri. finance as a viable business line.

The SBP Governor informed the participants that the agriculture sector was not only the
largest sector of the country’s economy, it was also the source of livelihood for at least 45 % of
the total employed labour force in the country, and added that adequate availability & access

SBP issues Framework for Branchless Banking Agent Acquisition and Management

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued the Framework for Branchless Banking Agent
Acquisition and Management for the banks and microfinance banks. This Framework is
complementary to Branchless Banking (BB) Regulations already in place.

According to this Framework, the Board of Directors of banks would be responsible for
providing the strategic direction and an oversight of branchless banking agent acquisition
and management while senior management will institute necessary internal controls and
ensure adherence to applicable laws and regulations. Banks have been advised to develop
and enforce overall Central Agent Management Policy, covering minimum agent selection
criteria, agent due diligence, business experience, financial position, integrity, personal
qualities, reputation, credit profile etc.

BB Regulations allow banks to deploy agent-based banking by involving non-banking
channels for distribution of basic banking services. The neighborhood agents - owners of
small businesses, retail stores, franchises etc. — can carry out basic banking operations for the
customers on behalf of the banks.

Currently, there are over three hundred thousand agents across Pakistan, creating a large
grid of human ATMs or touch points for cash in, cash out, fund transfers and bill payments
etc. Therefore, the effective management of delivery of services via this channel is crucial for
both better services to the customers and mitigation of risks arising from banks’ dependence
on third parties for provisioning of banking services.

It may be mentioned here that the framework also requires the banks to assess and mitigate
operational, liquidity, reputational, legal, money laundering/terrorist financing risks and
ensure consumer awareness and protection including the customer education, complaint
management and grievance redressal mechanism. Banks are also advised to ensure training
of branchless banking agents to manage the business of branchless banking.

MICROFINANCE OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE
WITHOUT SUBSIDIES: PROF. YUNUS

Microfinance operations can be run on sustainable basis without subsidies. This
was stated by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Prof. Muhammad Yunus, in an interactive
seminar held at State Bank of Pakistan today.

Prof. Yunus, who is the Managing Director of Grameen Bank, said that the
provision of financial services to the poor is doable as has been demonstrated by
Grameen Bank serving 7 million poor customers on sustainable basis. This requires
determination, imagination and hard work, he added.

Prof. Yunus shared Grameen Bank’s success story, the obstacles and constraints
faced, and the current outreach and sustainability numbers. He pointed out that a
commercial enterprise works on the principle of maximizing profits, while a social
business enterprise exists to serve a cause on the basis of cost coverage, reasonable rate
of return and retention of profits.

In order to provide financial services to the poor, enabling them to participate and
exploit economic opportunities, Prof. Yunus said that microfinance may be viewed as a
social business enterprise that serves a cause, covers the costs and also earns a reasonable
rate of return.

He said that in order to give necessary boost to the microfinance sector, the
commercial banks with their vast network, stable funding sources and handsome profits
may start microfinance subsidiaries and branches on social business enterprise principle.

Prof. Yunus also offered services of Grameen Bank on “Build, Operate and
Transfer” (BOT) basis, whereby Grameen Bank can establish model branches, systems,
procedures and make the business up and running before handing over to the initiating
bank.

Earlier, in his welcome address, the Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Mr. Mansur-ur-Rehman Khan said that the State Bank was playing a pro-active role in
setting up, nurturing and promoting microfinance institutions (MFIs). The microfinance
sector is the largest sector in Pakistan in terms of potential clientele base comprising
more than 25 to 30 million poor people, he added. Nevertheless, he pointed out that the
microfinance market in Pakistan is underdeveloped having less than 4% outreach, narrow
institutional base and limited retail capacity due to Pakistan’s late entry in the
microfinance sector.

“With the collaboration of microfinance stakeholders, we have developed a
National Strategy for Microfinance,’ he added. Mr. Mansur said that the number of
microfinance borrowers is likely to reach three million from existing one million within
next 2-3 years.

Mr. Azhar Iqbal Kureshi, Executive Director, Development Finance, SBP
presented the vote of thanks while Mr. Zulfikar Khokhar, Joint Director SMEs and
Microfinance Department, SBP presented an overview of microfinance sector in

Pakistan.

of agri. loans has increased by Rs 34 billion i.e. from Rs 261.6 billion to Rs 295.6 billion at end August
2014 as compared to same period last year.

It may be recalled that SBP has allocated agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs 500 billion to
banks for current fiscal year i.e. The target is 31.5% higher than the last year’s target of Rs 380 billion
and 28% higher than the actual disbursement of Rs 391.4 billion for 2013-14. Out of the total target, Rs

Guidelines on Standardization of Payment

Orders (PO) and Demand Drafts (DD)

State Bank of Pakistan has issued guidelines on Standardization of layout and Security
features of POs and DDs. The move is aimed at addressing the risk of fraud, forging in
Payment Orders (POs) and Demand Drafts (DDs) and to safeguard the interests of
general public by reducing the risk of counterfeiting.

The said guidelines mandate the use of “Minimum Security Features” in the paper
used in printing of POs and DDs comprising of Watermark, Anti-Forgery Ink, Ultraviolet
Fibers etc. In the area of layout, Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) line, name
of Drawee Bank Branch (in case of DD), maintenance of purchaser’s record by the
respective bank branch etc. have been introduced.

Moreover, to facilitate customers, Banks/MFBs have been advised to devise a
centralized mechanism for the verification of genuineness of POs and DDs.

In this regard, Banks are required to Set up 24/7 helpdesks / call centers, so that the
person in possession of instruments is easily able to verify the genuineness of the
instrument. Bank branch shall validate the genuineness of PO / DD if the holder of an
instrument approaches in person to any branch offering online banking services. Banks
are also required to arrange proper training of staff to examine / verify the security
features / genuineness of PO / DD.

It may be recalled here that last year SBP had issued instructions for standardization of
security features and layout of cheques. Now by standardizing POs and DDs, almost
96% of total financial instruments in clearing process will be standardized resulting in
uniformity and increased efficiency in the process as well as facilitation of general
public using them.

All the Banks and MFBs have been advised to issue POs and DDs as per the new
standard with effect from April 1, 2016.

LAUNCHING OF ELECTRONIC IMPORT FORM (EIF) MODULE

In order to effectively monitor imports into Pakistan, State Bank of Pakistan and Pakistan Customs
have successfully launched and implemented Electronic Import From (EIF) Module in WeBOC (Web
Based One Custom), the IT system of Pakistan Customs w.e.f. September 1, 2016. The said Module
has been developed in consultation with all the relevant stakeholders including the importers,

clearing agents, bankers, etc.

Well before the launch of EIF Module, a series of awareness sessions were conducted by a joint team
of SBP and Pakistan Customs at leading Chambers of Commerce throughout the country during the
last five months. During awareness sessions, it was mentioned at all forums that the importers shall
be filing the EIF using their existing IDs in WeBOC which they also use for filling the Goods

Declaration. Thus, no additional formalities on this account are involved.

It is worth mentioning that the Module was widely publicized by SBP and Pakistan Customs through
public notices, press release etc in the media. Further, comprehensive training sessions for
Authorized Dealers (ADs) have also been conducted by SBP to train the relevant bank staff of
southern, central and northern regions of the country. Thus, importers may contact respective
branches of ADs or Pakistan Customs’ help desks at various Collectorates around the country.

Similarly, a user manual to guide the importers regarding filing of EIF in WeBOC is also available at the

following link:

http://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2016/FEC5.

State Bank of Pakistan, however, remains available for clarification of any queries on the matter.

SBP making relentless efforts for the development
of country’s economy: Dr Akhtar

The State Bank of Pakistan, since its inception, has been making relentless efforts
with sincerity and honesty for the development of the country’s economy. The banking
industry has made significant progress in recent years and the State Bank has taken a
number of measures ensuring that people at large reap the benefits of economic
growth, sustainability of growth momentum and competitive environment.

This was stated by SBP Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, while speaking at the flag
hoisting ceremony held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today to mark the 61°
Independence Day. She said that the Independence Day provides the nation with an
opportunity to reiterate our commitment with our homeland.

Dr Akhtar said that despite several problems, Pakistan as a country has come a
long way since achieving Independence in 1947. She highlighted various unique features
and achievements of the country and said that “we all are proud to be Pakistanis.”

SBP Governor said being a leader of a national institution, she must admit that
still there are several impediments in our way to progress. “Partly we are also
responsible for that as we have not aligned ourselves with the requirements of the 21*
century,” she added. “We have yet to achieve self-reliance in all sectors, which is a
hallmark of a sovereign and vibrant nation,” she emphasized.

Paying rich tributes to forefathers of the nation, Dr Akhtar said that this Day
reminds us of our elders, who under the dynamic leadership of Quaid-e-Azam
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, scarified their lives and as a result of their unparalleled efforts,
Pakistan was created. She paid glowing tributes to the national heroes and tens of
thousands of unsung martyrs, who played a key role in the independence of the
country.

The ceremony was attended, among others, by Mr. Mansur-ur-Rehman Khan
and Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governors, senior executives, Directors, officers and

staff of the Bank besides families of the Bank employees.

RS. 130 BILLION TARGET ALLOCATED TO
AGRICULTURE SECTOR FOR 2005-06.

The annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
which was held in Karachi today under the Chairmanship of the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan, Dr. Ishrat Husain, has approved a target of Rs.130 billion for the disbursement
of agriculture credit to the farmers during the fiscal year 2005-06.

The Committee expressed its deep satisfaction that the total disbursement of
agriculture credit during the last fiscal year (2004-05) has reached the level of Rs. 108.6
billion which is 27.8 per cent higher than the target of Rs. 85 billion and 47.6 per cent
higher than the actual disbursement of the last fiscal year i.e. Rs. 74 billion. Five major
commercial banks disbursed Rs. 51.3 billion, Zarai Tariqiati Bank Ltd (ZTBL) disbursed
Rs. 37.4 billion, Punjab Provincial Cooperative Bank Ltd (PPCBL) Rs. 7.6 billion and
Domestic Private Commercial Banks (DPCBs) Rs. 12.3 billion. The five major
commercial banks jointly achieved their targets at 135 per cent and surpassed ZTBL, the
traditional lender for the agriculture sector. The DPCBs have surpassed their targets by
246 per cent. The Committee was pleased that 70 per cent of the total credit was made
available to the subsistence farmers i.e. those holding land below 12.5 acres.

The target of Rs. 130 billion for the disbursement of agriculture credit during the
current fiscal year is 53 per cent higher than the target of the last fiscal year which was 22
per cent higher than the actual disbursement during 2004-05.

The Chairman appreciated the impressive performance of commercial banks
particularly by DPCBs and five major commercial banks both in disbursements and
recoveries in agriculture credit. The Committee appreciated that the share of commercial
banks has tremendously been increased in agriculture credit from 23 per cent in 2000 to
59 per cent in 2005.

The Committee decided to replace the system of allocation of mandatory targets for
five major commercial banks namely, NBP, HBL, MCB, UBL and ABL with voluntary
targets i.e. purely in line with the targets of domestic private commercial banks. The
Committee also allocated these voluntary targets on provincial basis.

Fiscal discipline and restrictions on Govt. borrowing necessary

to contain inflation: SBP Third Quarterly Report

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that fiscal discipline and restrictions on Government borrowing
from SBP are necessary to contain inflationary expectations, which have become ingrained in recent months,
according to State Bank’s Third Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for FY11 released today.

‘In overall terms, although the post-flood hike in CPI inflation has largely dissipated, inflation is stubborn,
in excess of 13 percent. Possible reasons could include: (a) the lagged impact of government borrowings from SBP
during Jul-Sep 2010; (b) frequent upward adjustments in utility and POL prices; (c) increase in commodity prices;
and (d) the rising trend in the house rent index (HRI),’ the Report observed.

The Report said the Government is facing difficulties in containing the fiscal deficit. SBP Report stressed
that implementation of fiscal reforms still poses political challenges. ‘For instance, structural problems that require
difficult policy decisions for fiscal consolidation (e.g. expanding the base of GST through the withdrawal of
exemptions, tax on agri-income, and restructuring and privatization of PSEs) are pending resolution and awaiting
multi-partisan consensus,’ the Report added.

As far as financing is concerned, the Report observed that the Government has had little option but to
rely on domestic sources to finance a growing fiscal gap. More specifically, while borrowing from SBP was largely
contained at end-September 2010 levels, the abrupt change from April 2011 onwards (the Government borrowed
over Rs 350 billion from the central bank during 31* March — a"" May 2011) were largely meant to internalize the
growing quasi-fiscal expense (e.g. the circular debt in energy) into the budget. In other words, this borrowing is
actually financing the carry-over of quasi-fiscal deficits from previous years, according to the Report.

The SBP Report further said that the impact of the widening fiscal deficit is clearly visible in the sharply
rising domestic debt. Outstanding Government domestic debt reached Rs 5,594 billion (31.8 percent of estimated
GDP) which is more than double the stock at end-June 2007, the Report said and added that this sharp growth in
debt stock is fueling concerns about macro stability and monetary management.

‘In addition, the maturity profile of domestic debt reveals that the government has to rollover the entire
stock of Rs 2,854 billion of short term debt at least once a year. Any surge in credit demand from other sectors of
the economy could elevate rollover risk, and could also expose the government to interest rate risk,’ the Report
added.

In terms of fiscal management, going forward, desirable revenue generating measures (e.g. broadening of
the tax base, improving documentation of the economic system, gradual elimination of un-targeted subsidies and
curtailment of quasi-fiscal operations) are necessary to contain the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 percent of GDP in
FY12, the Report said, adding that these efforts need to be accompanied with better debt management to increase
the tenor of domestic debt and lower risks associated with debt re-pricing and rollover.

While emphasizing on significant improvement in the external sector, the Report said that the rising prices
of value added textiles and strong growth in remittances are main factors that pushed the current account into a
surplus of USS 748 million (Jul-Apr 2011) from a deficit of USS 3.5 billion in the corresponding period of the
preceding year. Textile exports managed to post strong growth despite efforts by competitor countries to hinder
concessionary access of Pakistani products in developed markets, the Report said and added that the steady
growth in remittances is a welcome development — for the first time in Pakistan’s history, monthly remittances
crossed the USS1 billion mark for two consecutive months (March and April 2011).

PRESS RELEASE

NAB investigation against SBP officials

The SBP Act 1956 mandates SBP to regulate the credit system of the country and empowers it through
the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 for this purpose. Using its authority and powers, SBP decided to
amalgamate KASB Bank into Banklslami in 2015 after a moratorium was imposed by the Federal
Government on its request to safeguard the interests of depositors and to ensure safety and soundness
of the banking system of the country. This step was taken due to poor financial condition of defunct
KASB bank and its inability to meet regulatory requirements despite opportunities being provided for an
extended period of time.

Since then a smear campaign was run in some quarters of media to dub this action by SBP against the law
and malign its staff for misuse of authority. Taking notice of these reports, the National Accountability
Bureau (NAB) initiated an inquiry into the matter and recently it has been learnt from its press release
that an investigation has been authorized against the officials of SBP for alleged misuse of authority in
terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into Banklslami.

SBP finds this decision of NAB to convert its inquiry into investigation disappointing since the inquiry
report available in the media does not appear to have incorporated all the detailed input provided by SBP
during the process and released through its communications to the general public. Such one sided views
lead to misjudgment about the authority of SBP as a guardian of the financial sector in general and the
interest of depositors in particular. Further, it negatively impacts the motivation of SBP staff to discharge
its duties without fear or favor.

All stakeholders of the defunct KASB Bank were well aware of the poor financial and operating conditions
of defunct bank, which was facing severe capital shortfall since 2009. As of September 30, 2014 Capital
(free of losses) of the defunct KASB Bank was only Rs 0.958 billion against requirement of Rs 10 billion.
Moreover, its Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was negative 4.63% against the required 10%. It was the only
bank which had a negative CAR.

Even the external auditors of the defunct KASB Bank in bank’s audited account as of 31° December 2013
also expressed concern over capital position of the bank. State Bank of Pakistan gave ample time and
opportunities to the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank to inject further capital into the bank so as to
make it capital compliant and viable bank. The sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank could not fulfill their
commitments for capital injection despite SBP’s consistent persuasion and instructions, nor could arrange
merger of the bank with any other bank. Besides capital shortfall, the bank and its sponsors were found
engaged in fraudulent practices and siphoning off more than Rs 3 billion from the bank, for which
separate complaints have been lodged with NAB.

Further, the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank introduced M/s. Cybernaut Investment Group of China,
as a potential investor. Following the procedure, SBP required documentation to establish their
credentials and proof of availability of funds worth USS100 million. Neither was provided. This left SBP
with no other option but to accept the offer of sole remaining interested party, i.e. Banklslami. No

Demonetization of Rs 500 Old-Design and Rs 5 Banknotes

Rs 500 bigger size and old design banknote and Rs 5 banknote will stand demonetized
with effect from 1 October 2011 and 1% January 2012 respectively. The State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) has, therefore, advised the general public to exchange Rs 500 bigger size old

from the field offices of SBP Banking Services Corporation (BSC) and branches of commercial
banks operating throughout the country.

The State Bank, for the benefit of public, has supplied posters in both the English &
Urdu languages regarding demonetization and exchange of banknotes of Rs 500 (old design)
and Rs 5 to SBP Banking Services Corporation and commercial banks for placement at
prominent visible places of their field offices and branches as well as at public places.

These posters and State Bank’s advice to commercial banks on banknotes are
available at the following links of SBP website:

It may be recalled that the Federal Government has already notified that old design
banknote of Rs 500 denomination (introduced on 1* April, 1986) will cease to be the legal
tender with effect from October 1, 2011 while banknote of Rs 5 denomination (introduced on

National Debt Retirement Program

It may be recalled that the Federal Government had launched National Debt Retirement Program
(NDRP) to pay off the ever increasing national debt in 1997. Funds in NDRP were accepted from
individuals, firms, companies and institutions etc. as Donations (NDRP-I), Qarz-e-Hasna (NDRP-II) and
Term Deposit (NDRP-III). A total of Rs.1.2 billion was received in local currency and USD 178 million

was received in foreign currency under the program.

The deposits under NDRP-I (Donations) were non-refundable whereas deposits under NDRP-II and
NDRP-III were for a minimum period of two years. The depositors were issued a receipt/certificate
against deposits under NDRP-II by banks whereas Special Saving Certificates (SSC) /Defence Saving
Certificates (DSC) were issued against deposits under NDRP-III by Central Directorate of National
Savings, Ministry of Finance. After the maturity, the depositors were able to encash their amounts at
par in case of NDRP-II and as per terms & conditions of SSC / DSC for deposits under NDRP-III. Out of
total receipts of Rs.1.2 billion in local currency, Rs.823 million were donations and Rs.408 million were
in the form of Qarz-e-Hasna and term deposits. As of now an amount of only Rs.12 million (approx)
has not been en-cashed/reclaimed by the depositors. Similarly out of total FCY receipts of USD 178
million, USD 28 million was donations and remaining USD 150 million was Qarz-e-Hasna and term

deposits. Almost all FCY deposits have been repaid.

While we have informed the public through a press release on 29"" March 2017 to approach their
respective banks to get their certificates en-cashed, there are still complains that the depositors are
facing difficulties in encashment of the certificates. While the term deposits (NDRP Ill) are en-
cashable from Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS), the Qarz-e-Hasna (NDRP II) certificates
can be en-cashed from the commercial banks where the amounts were deposited. All the depositors
are thus once again informed that they can approach their respective banks along with the original
receipt/certificate for encashment of their deposits under NDRP-II (Qarz-e-Hasna). The commercial
banks have also been advised to facilitate the claimants and encash the deposits after due verification
in accordance with respective rules & procedures. The banks after making the payments will claim

reimbursement from SBP against the deposit of paid documents and instruments etc.

Banking Sector’s performance and resilience remained satisfactory during H1CY20, says the
Mid-Year Performance Review of the Banking Sector

SBP has today issued the Mid-Year Performance Review (MPR) of the Banking Sector for the
year 2020. The review comprehensively covers the performance and soundness of the
banking sector for the period January to June 2020 (H1CY20).

The review suggests that—despite elevated economic stress driven by the COVID-19
pandemic—the assets of the banking sector witnessed a decent expansion of 7.8 percent
during H1CY20. Robust increase in investments, funded by surge in deposits, explains this
growth. Advances, on the contrary, observed mild downtick owing to the economic slackness
caused by the disruption in the business activities after the outbreak. Sans SBP supportive
measures, though, the contraction in advances could have been much higher.

The review also highlighted that the policy measures rolled out by SBP facilitated the banking
sector in conserving the capital, enhancing the lending capacity and increasing the loss
absorption ability. As a result, despite some increase in credit risk, banking sector
demonstrated improved profitability and enhanced resilience. The Non-performing loans
(NPLs) ratio increased from 8.6 percent as of end December 2019 to 9.7 percent as of end
June 2020. However, net NPLs to loans ratio, which is a better measure of credit risk,
increased only marginally from 1.7% to 1.9%. The earnings marked visible improvement as
profitability jumped by 52% on YoY basis. This improvement resulted from higher interest
income, deceleration in interest expenses and rise in non-interest income. With better
profitability, the soundness of the banking sector further strengthened as Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) increased to 18.7 percent in June-20 from 17.0 percent in December-19.

The review also includes the results of the 6"" wave of SBP’s Systemic Risk Survey (SRS)
conducted in July-August, 2020, which represents the views of the market participants. The
survey results indicate that—at present and for the next six months—the respondents
consider global risks and domestic macroeconomic risks to be important. Notably, the policy
measures taken by SBP to mitigate the implications of COVID-19 have been very well
received by the stakeholders.

Edhi commemorative coin unveiled at the State Bank of Pakistan

A Rs5O coin was unveiled at the State Bank of Pakistan Friday, 31° March, 2017 to commemorate the
services of late Abdus Sattar Edhi. Faisal Edhi, son of Abdus Sattar Edhi, was also present on the
occasion. Governor State Bank Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra presented the commemorative coin to
Faisal Edhi.

Governor SBP paid tribute to the late Abdul Sattar Edhi. He informed the audience that Pakistan had
issued only five commemorative coins highlighting personalities including Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad
Ali Jinnah, Shair-e-Mashrique Allama Muhammed Iqbal, Madar-e-Millat Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah,
Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed, and now Abdus Sattar Edhi. Edhi is the only social worker who
has been honored with a commemorative coin, he said. He said that in July 2016, the State Bank had
organized a condolence gathering to pay homage to Edhi, where the commemorative coin
announcement was made. On the recommendation of the State Bank, the Prime Minister had
decided to issue a coin to commemorate Edhi’s services at national level. The wide scope of Edhi
Foundation’s services reflects the late philanthropist’s deep insight into various social issues, he said,
adding that in rendering his services Edhi made no distinctions of geographical limits, color, race,
nationality and religion. The best way to pay tribute to Edhi Sahib is to espouse his cause and
cooperate in all philanthropic activities.

Mr. Faisal Edhi thanked the SBP and the Government of Pakistan for issuing the coin commemorating
Edhi’s services to the humanity. He said that Abdus Sattar Edhi would remain alive in the hearts of the
nation, his mission should continue forever for the benefit of people.

The ceremony began with Mr. Abid Qamar, Chief Spokesperson of the SBP, welcoming the
participants. Mr. Qamar told the audience that issuance of commemorative coins started on the
birth centenary of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah when three coins were issued. Twenty-seven
coins commemorating various personalities and occasion have been issued, including 100 and 150""
anniversaries of Islamia College Peshawar and Lawrence College. He informed the audience that
commemorative coins would be available from today at SBP field offices throughout the country.

The ceremony was attended by Deputy Governor Mr. Riaz Riazuddin, Managing Director SBP BSC Mr.
Qasim Nawaz, other senior officers of the Bank and Edhi Foundation volunteers.

SBP has appointed BOP as agent for collecting provincial receipt/taxes of GoP

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has appointed Bank of Punjab (BOP) as it’s agent for
collecting provincial receipts and taxes of Government of Punjab (GoP) in a signing
ceremony held today at SBP, Karachi. The appointment is a part of SBP’s strategy to
facilitate the Federal and Provincial Governments in improving their tax collection
systems. This will diversify tax payment options for the tax payers, introduce much
needed competition in Governments’ tax collection business and thus will improve

the service quality of banks engaged in government tax collection business.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Syed Irfan Ali, Executive Director, SBP said; “SBP,
being banker to the Federal and Provincial Governments, is fully committed to
provide efficient, competitive and state of the art banking services to the
governments either by itself or through its agencies across the country. He
expressed his optimism that inclusion of BOP will give a big boost to the provincial
government’s efforts to facilitate tax payers in payment of government dues and
taxes. He said, based on the experience of BOP, similar arrangements will be made
with other provincial governments to collect their taxes through banks of their

choice.

Mr. Naeemuddin Khan, President, BOP speaking on the occasion thanked SBP and
GoP for posing confidence for collecting the Punjab Government taxes. He said that
the agency agreement with SBP is a major milestone achieved and assured that the
customer facilitation and convenience will be the hallmark of the BOP’s agency

business, which will set new standards for the industry to follow.

State Bank’s fresh currency notes service 8877 receives
overwhelming public response

The SMS service launched by State Bank of Pakistan for issuance of fresh currency notes for Eid-ul-Fitr
2019 attracts a huge response.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) appreciates the interest shown by the general public in its 8877 SMS
service for obtaining fresh notes for Eid. This year service was launched on May 19, 2019 against
arrangements made at 1718 designated ‘e-branches’ in 142 cities as compared to 1535 branches in 132
cities last year. Furthermore, to facilitate maximum number of customers, the total booking limit was
also increased this year to 3 million customers as compared to 2.7 million customers limit last year.
However, the total capacity of this system is constrained by the number of customers that e-branches
can accommodate each day.

Accordingly, the new bookings have been closed as the service has exceeded its optimal limit of 3
million customers. However, the issuance of fresh currency notes against the already issued booking
codes will continue until the last day of the service i.e. May 31, 2019, subject to transaction code’s
validity.

It may also be noted that apart from this SMS service, banks may continue to provide fresh currency
notes to their customers from their branches and ATMs as sufficient quantity is being provided to them
by SBP.

SBP decides to implement International

Bank Account Number (IBAN) Standard in Pakistan

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to implement International Bank Account Number
(IBAN) standard in the country with a view to bringing about account code standardization and
efficiency in processing of payments for domestic as well as cross border transactions.

The IBAN guidelines issued by SBP today contain details for IBAN generation, validation and
implementation timelines. These guidelines have been developed in consultation with Pakistan
Banks’ Association (PBA) nominated committee on IBAN. All participants have been advised by
SBP to ensure implementation of IBAN as per given timelines.

According to the guidelines, the IBAN, an international standard (ISO 13616) for identifying
bank accounts across borders and will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, all
banks shall generate and notify IBAN to all their customers by December 2012. In the second
phase, IBAN account numbers will be operationally used (capturing, recognition, processing, validation,
transfer) both for domestic as well as for international financial transactions by June, 2013.

It may be pointed out that IBAN is made up of two components. The first component is
comprised of a country code and check digit and the 2™ component is called Basic Bank
Account Number (BBAN). The check digit mechanism in an IBAN compliant account number will
validate the accuracy of account number at the point of transactions entry at the remitting
institutions (domestic or international).

The benefits of IBAN are as under:

e A bank account standard across Pakistan will bring more efficiency in payment
processing by enabling the payments/clearing systems to electronically validate account
numbers and to decide the route a payment should take without manual intervention.

e Elimination of delays in credit transfers originating from IBAN compliant countries to
Pakistan as same are delayed, sometimes for several days due to manual intervention
required for sending credit transfers to non IBAN compliant account numbers.

e IBAN implementation will help in bringing more efficiency in remittance related
transactions as a significant percentage of these transactions are rejected due to
inaccurate account numbers information. Account validation at remitting institution due
to IBAN’s check digit mechanism will significantly reduce errors related to account
numbers.

The State Bank has asked the banks to generate and issue IBAN to its account holders. Banks
should encourage customers to use/quote their IBAN number in all financial transactions during

SBP, LUMS study to help increase lending to SMEs

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today launched an important study on fan industry in collaboration
with the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), which will help Pakistan’s banking sector
expand access to finance for the Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

The study covers important aspects of fan industry including historical growth trends in the
industry, composition, contribution to national economy, supply and demand side issues, SWOT analysis,
available growth opportunities, accounting practices, banking and financing needs of the sector, and
recommendations on increasing access to finance for the fan cluster.

According to the study, the most essential point for the sustainable development of the fan
industry in Gujrat and Gujranwala is to improve the capacity for independent innovation to help the
industry reach a higher place along the global value chain.

The study contains four patterns of innovation proposed by the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization -— product innovation, process innovation, function innovation and
interdepartmental innovation — and emphasizes the role of inter-organizational R&D departments,
research centres, new & advanced technology and universities.

The study also recommends for the setting up of an implementation committee, whose mandate
should be to develop an implementation plan with clear time-lines and targets based on the strategy

paper.

A dissemination seminar was held at SBP, Karachi today to share the major findings of the study
with banks and other stakeholders. Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Executive Director, State Bank of
Pakistan chaired the seminar, which was attended by senior executives of banks and other relevant SME
stakeholders.

Addressing the participants, Mr. Ashraf Khan commented that in Pakistan, reliable and credible
data on existing SME clusters is lacking, which hampers banks’ understanding of SME sub-sectors dynamics
and resultantly makes them shy of lending to the SME sector. In this backdrop, he said, the State Bank has
been collaborating with reputed research institutions/consulting firms to conduct research on key SME
clusters to facilitate financial institutions in better understanding of the sectors and accordingly come up
with improved products for these clusters.

‘Today we are here to unveil findings of research report on fan cluster and emphasize upon banks
to make maximum use of the study findings while designing banking products for the industry and fulfilling
their financing needs.’, he added.

Mr. Usman Khan, Project Consultant from LUMS, gave a detailed presentation to the participants
covering the important aspects of the study, which was followed by a question-answer session.

The study report on fan cluster is latest addition to the surveys of 10 important clusters recently
conducted by SBP in collaboration with International Finance Corporation (IFC). The booklets of these
surveys placed on http://www.sbp.org.pk/departments/ihfd-ifc.htm provide important guidance to banks
on increasing lending to SMEs through customized and low-cost product programs.

Automation of Form E----- SBP and FBR sign MoU

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Chairman FBR Mr. Tariq
Bajwa have shown optimism that automation of Form E will have manifold benefits to all
stakeholders and the country would reap advantages of increased inflow of foreign exchange.
‘The automation will reduce cost of doing business for exporters and will bring efficiency in
the system,’ the Governor said. The Chairman FBR remarked that automation of Form E will
also facilitate in efficient processing of duty drawback claims of the exporters as well as
preventing any fake/bogus documentation.

Governor SBP and the Chairman FBR were speaking at the signing ceremony of
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between State Bank of Pakistan and Federal Board of
Revenue (FBR) at SBP Headquarters today on October 26, 2015. In order to streamline
issuance of Form-E, State Bank of Pakistan and the Pakistan Customs had initiated a project
for the automation of the process of issuing Form-E. In this regard, an Electronic Form-E
(EFE) module has been developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and incorporated
in the Pakistan Customs’ electronic system called Web based One Customs (WeBOC).

The landmark development is expected to provide several benefits to stakeholders including
reduced cost of doing business for exporters, efficient processing of duty draw back claims of
exporters, elimination of fake/forged Form-E, improve repatriation of foreign exchange
besides bringing efficiency to the current system.

At present, most of the exports are processed through WeBOC but a small percentage of the
export cargo are being exported through the ‘One Customs’ system. Efforts are underway to
expand scope of the EFE module to export of such goods as well. Currently, Form-E is issued
manually by Authorized Dealers (Banks). The system will begin receiving applications for
EFE with effect from November 2, 2015, for exports taking place from November 11, 2015
onwards. The request for EFE will be submitted electronically by the exporter in WeBOC and
Authorized Dealer will approve or reject EFE electronically in WeBOC. Accordingly,
paragraph 36 has been added in Chapter XII of FE Manual 2002, which provides regulations
for issuance of EFE. However, for exports taking place through One Customs, manual Form-E
will be issued by Authorized Dealers as per existing instructions.

After electronic approval of Form-E by the Authorized Dealer, the exporter will attach EFE in
WeBOC with Goods Declaration (GD) Form to carry out export of goods for which Form-E
has been approved. The serial number of EFE for each Authorized Dealer will be generated by
WeBOC.

Authorized Dealer shall fill in relevant sections of Bank Credit Advice (BCA) for each EFE in
WeBOC, including the date of lodging shipping documents with Authorized Dealer,

Bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement signed
between the central banks of Pakistan and China.

A landmark bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement (CSA) has been signed between State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) and the People’s Bank of China (PBC) in a ceremony held on 23 Dec.2011 in
Islamabad, Pakistan by Governor SBP Yaseen Anwar and Deputy Governor PBC Mr. DU Jinfu.

The bilateral CSA has been concluded in Chinese Yuan CNY 10 billion and Pakistan Rupee
PKR 140 billion for the purpose of promoting bilateral trade and investment and strengthening
financial cooperation. The currency swap would expire in three years, but could be extended
with mutual consent.

We expect that bi-lateral Trade and investment will grow between Pakistan and China as a result
of this agreement, further augmenting the economic ties of the two countries. This agreement
will make a significant contribution in further strengthening the close and special relationship
between the two countries.

Announcement of the Currency Swap Agreement between the two Central Banks will give
positive signal to the market on the availability of liquidity of the other country’s currency on the
onshore market. As a result it will promote bi-lateral trade denominated in Chinese Yuan and

Pakistan Rupee.

Depositors of the former KASB Bank start transactions with BankIslami

State Bank of Pakistan is pleased to inform that the amalgamation of the defunct
KASB Bank into BankIslami Pakistan Ltd has been implemented smoothly. As a
result all the depositors which are over 150000 in number and have Rs 57 Billion in
deposits are free to operate their accounts. Many of them have already started
operating their accounts and more than 1200 employees have continued their jobs.

All the branches of the defunct bank, now taken over by BankIslami, remained open
for business on Friday, while the branches at major business centres also opened on

Saturday. The customers freely operated their accounts as per their convenience. So

far, no complaint of any sort has been reported and, in any such case, the customers

may contact their respective branches or call centre of BankIslami.

Regarding some apprehensions about the amalgamation of a conventional bank into
an Islamic bank, it is clarified that the process is in compliance of Shariah. The
Banklslami has planned to gradually transfer the defunct bank’s conventional
banking operations into Shariah based operations. The customers of the bank may
seek further clarifications from the bank management in this regard.

An important issue that is often debated in some quarters of the media is the
notional value at which the defunct bank has been handed over to BankIslami. In
this regard, it would be pertinent to mention that post due diligence, all the four
banks which had shown interest in acquiring the defunct bank had come out with an
estimated negative equity gap of Rs. 12 to 14 billion in addition to the shortfall in
Minimum Capital Requirement (Rs.10 billion). Following the international
practices, a notional value of Rs1000 was set for the defunct bank. There are many
examples of such international practices such as the sale of Barings Bank at a price
of 1 pound to ING group, Lehman Brothers Asia Pacific business taken over by
Nomura Holdings for consideration of only 2 US $ and Northern Rock taken over
by the government without any payment.

State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges the depositors' confidence in the regulator and
reiterates its commitment to safeguard the interests of depositors to ensure safety
and soundness of the banking system of the country. From now on it is business as
usual.

Governor SBP takes stock of banking and development
finance issues during his visit to Quetta

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra spent a busy day in provincial
capital Quetta and held meetings with CEOs of commercial banks and representatives of Quetta
Chamber of Commerce & Industry (QCCI).

Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, in continuation of his earlier engagements with Banking
Industry and different Chambers of Commerce & Industry, invited the Chief Executive Officers
(CEOs), of all leading banks for a meeting on Mondayat Quetta.These engagements are aimed at
understanding, at firsthand, issues faced by industries of specific area; assessing the efficiency of
intermediary function performed by banks, and addressing the limitations encountered by banks
in effectively performing their intermediary function.

Governor, SBP advised banks to take steps, which interalia included the following items: All banks to
prepare at least three years business plan to strengthen their presence in Baluchistan; take concrete
steps to increase number of branchless banking agents, branchless banking accounts and ATMs in the
province; open branches in underserved districts of the province; increase the financing, particularly,
in the concessional finance schemes of SBP/GoP, and, maintain continued focus on AML/CFT risks.

The aforementioned steps have been identified to increase the footprint of banking industry in
the province of Baluchistan for achieving the SBP’s strategic goal (2020) of enhancing the
Financial Inclusion in country:

State Bank of Pakistan is cognizant of fact that private sector lending is picking up, on account of,
improved security situation and better availability of energy; however, a lot needs to be done,
particularly, in areas which have remained marginalized, to ensure that economic growth is
inclusive and its benefits are shared by all stakeholders.

Governor, SBP sensitized the CEOs of the banks on continued improvement in security situation
in Baluchistan, realization of projects under CPEC, development of Gwader Port and untapped
natural resources, which together offer tremendous opportunities for growth and employment.
Banks were advised to promote the concessional financing schemes offered by SBP/GoP and take
concrete steps to increase financing under these concessional schemes to the promising
businesses in Baluchistan.

Later in the day, Governor also met with the President, Vice Presidents, other office bearers and
members of Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI). During the meeting, the
Governor informed business community about SBP’s efforts in promoting microfinance, agri-
credit and SME financing in Baluchistan. “Earlier this morning, we have gathered
Presidents/CEOs of all banks in Quetta to express our resolve to facilitate Baluchistan business
community. I have urged them to take concrete steps to increase financing to priority sectors in
the province”, said Governor.

The Governor told that in the light of Agriculture Credit Advisory Committee’s recommendation,
specific targets are being allocated to the banks for underserved/underdeveloped areas. Like-

State Bank Issues Instructions & Guidelines for
Shariah Compliance in IBIs

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued Instructions & Guidelines for Shariah
Compliance in Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) to further strengthen the Shariah
compliance framework in Islamic banking industry.

These ‘Instructions and Guidelines for Shariah Compliance’ have been finalized
in consultation with various stakeholders as well as reviewed and approved by the SBP
Shariah Board.

It may be pointed out that these Instructions and Guidelines for IBIs are in
addition to current Prudential Regulations, guidelines and other directives issued by the
SBP.

The ‘Instructions for Shariah compliance in IBIs’ cover various areas related to
appointment, removal and working of Shariah Advisors (SAs); conflict resolution in
Shariah rulings; Shariah compliant modes; use of charity fund, introduction of new
products and services and schedule of service charges etc. It may be pointed out that
essentials of Islamic modes of financing, issued by SBP in April 2005, have now been
augmented and made part of these instructions.

According to these instructions, every IBI will be required to appoint a Shariah
Advisor in line with a clear set of instructions issued by the SBP including that the
appointment of Shariah Advisor will be approved by the Board of Directors; Shariah
Advisor will be required to meet the ’Fit and Proper Criteria for Shariah Advisors’
notified by the SBP; the Fatawa and rulings of the Shariah Advisor in all financial
matters shall be binding on the IBIs etc.

In terms of duties & responsibilities of the Shariah Advisor (SA), the SA will be
responsible to review operations of the IBI on periodic basis in coordination with
officials responsible for Shariah compliance to ensure that all the products and services
being offered by the IBI conform to the injunctions of Shariah. If any income is declared
as non-Shariah compliant by the SA, the same shall be credited to Charity Account
opened for this purpose. According to the instructions, the SA will also be required to
prepare a report on the IBI’s annual financial statement in respect of its Shariah
compliance.

These instructions also deal with Conflict Resolution in Shariah rulings wherein
in case of any difference of opinion arising between the SA of an IBI and the State
Bank’s inspection staff or other SBP departments regarding Islamic Banking practices,
the State Bank may refer the case to the SBP Shariah Board and the decision of SBP
Shariah Board will be final.

The State Bank has also introduced a complete new set of Shariah-compliant
modes of Banking and Financing for IBIs that include Mudaraba; Musharaka;
Diminishing Musharaka; Equity participation in the form of shares in a corporate entity;
Tjarah or Ijarah wa Iqtina; Murabaha; Musawamah; Salam; Istisna; Tawarrugq; Qard;
Wakalah; Assignment of Debt and Kafalah.

State Bank holds special exhibition to celebrate Pakistan Resolution Day

State Bank of Pakistan celebrated Pakistan Resolution Day on 23"" March, 2019 by holding a special
exhibition “Art in Coinage” at SBP Museum, Karachi. The exhibition highlights the work of renowned
artist Mr. Abdul Jabbar Gul as well as history of coinage.

While inaugurating the exhibition, Mr. Jameel Ahmad, Deputy Governor, State Bank said, “it is an
honour for me to speak on this important day in Pakistan’s history when the resolution to create a new
homeland for Muslims of the subcontinent was passed in 1940 at Minto Park, Lahore”. Further, he said
“today we commemorate the efforts of those daring individuals of the subcontinent, who in the face
of adversity resolved to establish a separate homeland. The clarity of their vision and the depth of their
commitment is evident by the fact that Pakistan came into being within just seven years after the
resolution was passed.”

Referring to the exhibition, he said” “this exhibition is unique in the sense that history is told through
art by highlighting the artistry in coinage of Pakistan, which is usually overlooked due to small size of
coins”.

The Deputy Governor drew attention of the audience towards the mural installed on the facade of the
LRC Building in the compound of SBP, terming it as an iconic symbol within the premises of SBP and
appreciated the work done by Mr. Abdul Jabbar Gul, who was also present on the occasion. Mr. Abdul
Jabbar Gul was selected in 2004 to design and install a huge coin mural on the building of Learning
Resource Centre, State Bank of Pakistan. The mural is 18ft high and 24 ft wide containing 45 coins with
remarkable beauty. He completed this remarkable and unique project in just four months.

The exhibition displays models of these 45 coins used in the murals, which were replicated on actual
scale and put up on panels of 3ftx3ft. The technique used in creating murals is of model casting process
whereby design were made in MDF Lasani wood and then molding was done in plaster. Using the “cold
bronze casting” technique in which the bronze powder is mixed with resin to prepare the plaster.

Several periods of coinage starting from cowrie shell to the decimalization of coinage, table of
conversion, design process of coinage and a chronological history of coins of Pakistan from 1948 to

date.

The exhibition was attended by consul generals of Turkey and Japan, dignitaries of the city, State Bank
officials and people from different walk of life.

State Bank supporting SMEs for setting up business and its growth

To improve awareness about its SME finance policy and refinance schemes, State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) conducted meetings with manufacturers and exporters of cutlery, stainless
steel utensils, water pumps and ceramics belonging to SME sector in Gujranwala.
Representing SBP, Syed Samar Hasnain, Executive Director, State Bank of Pakistan said that
SMEs can avail a number of financial services such as setting up and expansion of their
business and working capital finance for specific sectors.

“All refinance facilities are available for end users at fixed rate of 6% per annum and that
banks are also incentivized to lend to SMEs,” said Mr. Hasnain. He elaborated on recent
measures including enhancement of maximum loan limit to Rs.1 million from Microfinance
Banks, simplification of loan application form and fixation of maximum turn-around-time
with the aim to facilitate small and medium enterprises.

Mr. Hasnain informed the participants that banks have been advised to promote non-
financial advisory services for hand-holding of SMEs. Adding further, he shared that in order
to better serve SMEs the National Institute of Banking and Finance, a wholly owned
subsidiary of SBP, has trained around 2,500 bankers last year.

Mr. Hasnain asserted that SME finance policy along with number of refinance facilities for
the SMEs will pave way to enhance current share of SME finance of 8.5% of the total private-
sector credit to 17% by 2023. He added that number of borrowers is also expected to rise
from current 180,000 to 700,000 by 2023. He informed the participants that to achieve these
objectives, banks have been given targets at national and provincial levels. He stressed upon
banks and SME associations to create regional and national level awareness campaigns.

Monetary Policy Statement
May 21, 2016

Towards the end of FY16, macroeconomic conditions continue to improve. Headline
CPI inflation, despite its continuous increase on Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, would
remain below its FY16 annual average target of 6 percent. Real GDP growth is set to
exceed its FY15 outcome of 4.2 percent, while remaining below its target of 5.5 percent.
Current account deficit is likely to shrink to the previous year’s level of around 1
percent of GDP and the expected surplus in balance of payments would be marginally
less than the FY15 level. Foreign exchange reserves are still projected to maintain
upward trajectory.

As expected, headline CPI inflation sustained its rising trend for the seventh
consecutive month and on YoY basis rose to 4.2 percent in April 2016 from the low of
1.3 percent in September 2015. In addition to the seasonal impact of perishable food
items and services, this increase owes to further waning of the base effect and second
round impact of decline in oil prices. Similarly, core inflation measures have broadly
followed a rising trend in this fiscal year indicating buildup of underlying inflationary
tendencies. Despite these trends and developments, the inflation outlook for FY16 is
low.

However, going into FY17 inflation is likely to attain a higher plateau.

Major sources that would determine this path are as follows. First, relatively faster
pickup in demand compared to its gradually improving supply dynamics could lead
inflation on a higher side. Second, rising global oil price along with modest recovery in
non-energy commodity prices will pass on to the domestic consumer prices. Third,
some risks, such as imposition of new taxation measures and increase in electricity and
gas tariffs, if realized would put upward pressure on CPI inflation.

Expansion in industrial activities and services sector would salvage some of the lost
momentum to GDP growth due to the losses from cotton and rice crops. Recovery in
Large-scale Manufacturing, which grew by 4.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY16 compared
to 2.8 percent in Jul-Mar FY15, is expected to continue further on account of improving
energy and security conditions. At the same time, buoyant growth in construction and
improved demand for consumer durables has persistently indicated revival in domestic
demand in the current fiscal year. This is also reflected in uptake in credit to private
sector which increased by Rs314.7 billion during Jul-Mar FY16 compared to Rs206.0

State Bank of Pakistan voted as the best central bank for promoting Islamic finance

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been voted as the Best Central Bank in promoting Islamic
finance for the fourth time by a poll conducted by Islamic Finance News (IFN), REDmoney
Group Malaysia, today. This is the second international award bestowed upon SBP for Islamic
Banking during FY2021. Earlier the Global Islamic Finance Awards (GIFA) has also declared SBP
as the Best Central Bank of the year in September 2020.

IFN while announcing the poll results stated, “It is always a closely contested battle for the top
spot, but 2020 was rather more of a runaway victory than we have seen in recent years. The
2018 winner, the State Bank of Pakistan, achieved a decisive win with almost three quarters of
the votes.” It was further stated by IFN that this year despite global pandemic, they have
received the highest number of votes for the poll in its 16 years history.

The Islamic banking sector in Pakistan continued strong growth momentum during 2020 and its
share in the overall banking industry’s assets and deposits stood at 16.0 percent and 17.3
percent respectively with a network of 3,303 branches in 122 districts across the country as of
September 2020.

Increasing financial inclusion by providing an enabling environment and promoting Islamic
banking in the country is an important component of SBP’s strategy. Further, Islamic banking
has been made an integral part of National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) of Government of
Pakistan to serve those who prefer Islamic products or who are voluntarily excluded or
underserved due to their religious belief. Under the enhanced NFIS 2023, market share of the
Islamic banking in the overall banking industry has been targeted at 25%.

State Bank of Pakistan has always shown its resolve and commitment towards building sound
foundations for sustainable growth of the Islamic banking industry in the country. With
particular reference to the testing times of last year, in the backdrop of COVID-19, SBP has
issued three major Shariah compliant Islamic refinance schemes. These include Islamic
refinance scheme for payment of wages and salaries to the workers and employees of business
concerns (Rozgar Scheme), Islamic Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and Islamic
Refinance Facility for Combating Covid-19 (IRFCC). These refinance schemes helped faith
sensitive clientele to take advantage of facilities offered by SBP that aimed at combating the
adverse effects of the pandemic. Another landmark initiative of SBP is launch of Shariah
compliant Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates under Roshan Digital Account for overseas
Pakistanis. Recently, SBP has also issued guidelines for Development Finance Institutions to
undertake Shariah compliant business.

Achieving four IFN awards of the best central bank since 2015 in addition to other international
accolades is the reflection of global recognition of the strategic measures that SBP is
undertaking to foster sustainable growth of Islamic banking in Pakistan.

National Financial Literacy Program milestones achieved: SBP

The National Financial Literacy Program (NFLP) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) completed
its third year at the end of FY20 with all the targets surpassing for the fiscal year, despite the
outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020.

In order to address the challenge of financial exclusion, the Government of Pakistan adopted
a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) in 2015. The NFIS aims to enhance formal
financial access to 50 percent of the adult population by 2020. Accordingly, with the core
objective to enhance access to finance in the country and encourage usage of formal banking
channels, the State Bank of Pakistan took the lead in implementing the measures suggested
vide the NFIS and incorporated the same in its Strategic Vision 2020. Among other measures,
one major initiative was the launch of NFLP.

NFLP is SBP’s flagship program that is focused on imparting basic financial education to
unbanked/underserved segments of population especially the women and youth. Keeping in
view the diversity and literacy level of target audience, the NFLP program has been segmented
into two components, National Financial Literacy Program for Adults (NFLP-A) and the National
Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y). The objectives of this program are to i) Provide
financial education to around 2.6 million beneficiaries over five years, 1 million through NFLP-
A and 1.6 million through NFLP-Y; ii) have gender mix of 50:50; and iii) to open bank or mobile
accounts of the beneficiaries.

Under NFLP-A, despite the prevailing pandemic of COVID 19, 250,000 participants were given
financial education during FY20 against the target of 226,000 beneficiaries, through almost
10,000 classroom sessions and 300 street theatre programs. This comprised of 70%
participants located in rural area with significant improvement in female participation (42% in
FY19 to 57% in FY20). The number of participants who opened a bank or mobile account at the
end of the session, also showed remarkable improvement from 53% in FY19 to 83% in FY20.
Since the initiation of NFLP-A in August 2017, more than 600,000 adults have been imparted
financial education.

Under NFLP-Y, since its inception in Oct 2018, around 300,000 students have been trained
against a target of 240,000 students by end March 2020. This program envisages to impart
financial education to three age groups 9-12 years, 13-17 years and 18-29 years across 45
selected districts of Pakistan.

In addition to the above and to supplement the message of financial literacy, various other
initiatives have been taken under NFLP which include: i) country-wide media campaigns to
sensitize the masses about the program; ii) setting up of a dedicated toll-free helpline for
public queries; iii) launch of dedicated website (financialeducation.pk) to provide information
on basic financial concepts, program schedule and other routine updates; iv) MoUs signed

Strengthening of the State Bank of Pakistan’s enforcement powers through
enactment of the Foreign Exchange (Amendment) Act, 2016

State Bank of Pakistan’s powers to regulate the foreign exchange business have been strengthened
through enactment of the Foreign Exchange (Amendment) Act, 2016.

The major amendment through the above Act in the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1947 is
the insertion of a new section 23K, which empowers SBP to impose monetary penalties on its
regulatees i.e. Authorized Dealers (Banks) and Exchange Companies on account of violation of foreign
exchange rules and regulations. The said section also provides that every director, manager, officer,
agent etc. of an entity shall be deemed guilty of violation if the violation was committed with his
knowledge or consent or if he did not exercise due diligence while performing his duties.

The above amendment was considered necessary in view of liberalization of foreign exchange regime
and significant increase of foreign exchange business since enactment of the original law. Thus, in
order to effectively regulate foreign exchange business of banks and exchange companies, SBP
needed to have corresponding enforcement powers. However, as the same were not available, it had
to follow a lengthy procedure of adjudication for imposition of penalties. Further, it could only
suspend or cancel the license of a bank or an exchange company on violation of any provision of the
Act which often became more severe than the violation warranted.

The newly inserted section also provides right to the person aggrieved by an order passed to prefer
appeal to the designated Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan.

Moreover, by carrying out some other related amendments in different sections of FERA 1947, the
role of Tribunal and Foreign Exchange Adjudication Court has been clearly bifurcated with respect to
handling of cases regarding FX violations by the persons other than regulatees of SBP.

Rs 358 billion will be available to exporters
under EFS during FY09

Funds amounting to Rs 358 billion would be available to exporters for the export of products
eligible under the Export Finance Scheme during FY09 as the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr
Shamshad Akhtar has decided to increase the overall quantum of export finance for banks under this
Scheme.

In order to ensure availability of adequate financing to the exporters under the Export Finance
Scheme (EFS) and to assist them in achieving the exports target, the State Bank of Pakistan would
allow limits of Rs 125 billion to the banks under the Scheme for the current year which are 25%
higher than the amount outstanding as on 30"" June 2008. As loans under the Scheme are allowed for
180 days, therefore, around Rs.250 billion would be provided during the year as refinance from the
State Bank at the rate of 7.5%. In addition to this, banks would also provide financing facilities to the
exporters under the Scheme from their own sources, to the extent of 30%, which comes out to Rs 108
billion, at the same rate of 7.5%. Commercial banks have been brought on board further on this
sharing mechanism.

Furthermore, in order to ensure timely availability of financing to exporters, the State Bank has
also advised the banks that in future, financing requests from exporters under EFS should not be
turned down, which otherwise are meeting the requirements of EFS and lending criteria of the
respective bank. State Bank would regularly monitor the behavior of banks in optimal utilization of
limits and if a bank is unable to fully utilize its allocated limit, its unutilized limit would be allocated
to other banks.

It may be added here that the State Bank of Pakistan and commercial banks have provided
export finance to the exporters during FY 08 at 7.5% which is substantially lower than ongoing 6-
month KIBOR (at present around 13.5%). Further, SBP has also provided refinance amounting to Rs 6
billion under its Long Term Financing for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP) Scheme to the
exporters during FY08, at a fixed rate of mark up of 7% for a period from 2 years to 7-1/2 years.
Moreover, during the period from January to June 2008, SBP and banks/DFIs have also provided an
amount of Rs 1.134 billion under the Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) to the exporters for a
period of up to 10 years at concessional rate of mark up.

All the above measures taken by SBP are aimed at ensuring adequate supply of financing to
exporters at concessional rates of mark up to enable them to compete in the international markets to

boost exports from the country.

State Bank forms committees to scale-up warehouse receipt financing mechanism, and
increase agri-credit in under-served provinces

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced formation of two
separate committees to scale-up warehouse receipt financing mechanism, and increased agri-credit in
under-served provinces and regions. He was addressing a Mid Term Review Meeting of the Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) for FY 2014-15 in Faisalabad today.

“During first seven months of FY 2014-15, banks have disbursed Rs.256 Billion of agricultural credit and
achieved 51% of the annual Agriculture Credit Disbursement Target which is Rs. 500 billion. This is an
increase of 35% compared to the disbursement made during the same period last year”. Mr. Wathra
shared with the participants. He congratulated the banks for their remarkable performance.

Mr. Wathra said that the performance of agriculture credit growth is on track, and sector is poised to
achieve over 53% of the agriculture credit demand in FY 2014-15 compared to only 39% in FY 2009-10.
Pointing out the gradual reduction of agri-credit demand-supply gap over the recent years, Mr. Wathra
urged up the banks to do more to further reduce this gap. He asserted that agriculture based growth has
positive and far-reaching influence on poverty alleviation, food security, export income and employment.

ACAC expressed the satisfaction over improvement in non-performing loans which has come down to all-
time low 11.4% alongside positive growth trends in banks’ agri-credit disbursements. ACAC was informed
that presently 33 financial institutions were proving agri credit in the country, compared with 20
Participating Financial Institutions in 2010. As a result, private sector banks including microfinance banks
are increasingly meeting financing needs of the agriculture sector.

Speaking to the audience, Mr. Wathra reiterated State Bank and government’s commitment in promoting
agriculture finance through inclusive and broad-based initiatives. He appreciated improving market trend
from being predominantly state-sponsored to being more open and market-led. He admired the
transformation brought about by diverse, strong, and forward-looking financial institutions. He also
appreciated the banks’ collective efforts in improving areas like product-mix, portfolio quality, and use of

ACAC REVIEWS THE DISBURSEMENT OF CREDIT TO THE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FY07.

The mid-term meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
was held in Karachi with Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar in the
chair, to review the disbursement of agriculture credit to the farmers during the first half
of the fiscal year 2006-07.

The Committee was informed that the banks during July-December, 2006
disbursed Rs 72 billion to the agriculture sector which is 16% higher than the
disbursements of Rs 62 billion during the same period last year. Bank-wise break-up
revealed that five big banks (NBP, HBL, UBL, MCB Bank & ABL) as a group disbursed
Rs 34.3 billion, ZTBL, Rs 24.2 billion, PPCBL Rs 3.0 billion and Domestic Private
Banks (DPBs) Rs 10.2 billion during the six months ended December, 2006 as against
Rs 33.5 billion, Rs 19.3 billion, Rs 2.0 billion and Rs 7.1 billion respectively during the
same period last year.

The Committee expressed its concern that the disbursement covered about 45% of
SBP targets for fiscal year 2006-07 as against 48% covered in the corresponding period
last year. The achievements of banks during July-December 2006 revealed that five big
banks as a group achieved about 43%, ZTBL 50%, PPCBL 33% and the Domestic
Private Banks as a group achieved 44% of their annual targets as against 53%, 45%, 22%
and 48% of the last year’s achievements respectively.

The ACAC noted that out of the total disbursements, farm sector got a share of
87% whereas non-farm sector had a share of only 13%. Livestock, dairy farming and
poultry having an important role in poverty reduction, received 12% of the total
disbursement as against the target of 15%.

The SBP Governor while expressing dissatisfaction over the slower growth in
disbursement of credit to the agriculture sector impressed upon the banks to take
necessary steps to accelerate the pace of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector
during the coming months so that the full year target of Rs.160 billion should be
achieved. She also expressed her concern over the dismal performance of some banks
regarding agriculture credit disbursements. She asked the heads of banks to submit their
action plans to her to overcome the shortfall and to meet their annual disbursement
targets.

Dr. Shamshad Akhtar stressed upon the banks to formulate a long-term vision and
strategy to develop agriculture finance as a viable business line. She stressed the need for
creating a conducive environment for increasing the credit outreach. She said that the
need for developing an enabling environment for increasing the flow of credit was

ERD/M&PRD/PR/01/2017-100 October 12, 2017

Economy continued to expand, posting a decade high real GDP growth of 5.3 percent

 

State Bank of Pakistan released its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for the fiscal year
2016-17 today. According to the Report, Pakistan’s economy continued to expand with real GDP
growing by 5.3 percent in FY17, the highest growth achieved during the last 10 years. A sharp recovery
in agriculture sector, healthy value addition in the services sector, and continued improvement in
manufacturing sector contributed to this broad based growth. From the demand side, the growth was
led by a surge in consumption followed by a moderate increase in investment.

The Report explains that the major impetus to economic activity came from an accommodative
monetary policy and consequent increase in private sector credit especially for fixed investment; tax
incentives for agriculture, exporting industries and investment; a steady increase in development
spending; and, continuing work on infrastructure and energy projects under CPEC. These factors led to
increase in domestic demand.

With the increase in domestic demand, imports also picked up pace. This, together with decline in
exports and remittances, resulted in current account deficit increasing to USS 12.1 billion in FY17
compared to USS 4.6 billion in FY16. The Report noted that higher official and private inflows helped to
partially finance the current account deficit.

While the Report recognizes that tax incentives and steady increase in development spending helped
economic activity, these led the fiscal deficit increasing to 5.8 percent of GDP in FY17 compared to 4.6
percent in FY16. Meanwhile, though inflation trended upward, it continued to be well anchored and
remained lower than the target for the third consecutive year in FY17. The average CPI inflation rose to
4.2 percent during FY17 after falling to 2.9 percent in FY16.

The Report also highlights the main challenges that need to be addressed to sustain the current pace of
expansion in the economy while keeping inflation low and stable going forward. It particularly
emphasizes on containing unnecessary imports and expanding export base in order to keep current
account deficit at manageable level. Moreover, to maintain the current pace of spending on
infrastructure and social development projects, the growth in revenue collection needs to be
accelerated. This can be achieved by deepening the reforms initiated at federal level and stepping up
efforts by provinces to enhance their own tax collection. The Report also suggests further improvement
in business conditions to strengthen recovery in investment and thus help switch away from current
consumption led to investment-cum-export oriented growth.

The SBP report also highlights the issue of growing water stress in the country amid erratic supply and
continuously increasing demand in the face of rising population, rapid urbanization and high wastage. It
further points out that quality of both the surface and ground water has deteriorated due to pollution
and excessive use of fertilizer and pesticides. It underscores the need for improvement in management
of water resources through minimizing losses and encouraging conservation to ensure smooth future
supplies for human consumption and its commercial use. The detailed Report is available at SBP website

www.sbp.org.pk.

State Bank releases Third Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy for FY19

While Pakistan’s economy moved along the stabilization phase led by demand management policies,
vulnerabilities in the external and fiscal sectors persisted during Jul-Mar FY19, according to the State
Bank of Pakistan’s Third Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy released today. This
implies that the current stabilization agenda needs to be reinforced with deep rooted structural
reforms.

The pace of economic growth slowed down considerably during FY19, mainly in response to policy
measures taken to curb the twin deficits. These measures affected the performance of the industrial
sector and dampened manufacturing activities in the country. Meanwhile, water- and weather-related
concerns, in tandem with the higher cost of major inputs, took a toll on crop production. The weak
showing by the commodity-producing sectors also constrained the output of the services sector.

Moreover, the fiscal deficit deteriorated further, as a steep fall in non-tax revenues and a slowdown in
tax revenue led the overall revenue collection to stagnate at last year’s level. On the other hand,
expenditure increased sharply during Jul-Mar FY19, specifically the current expenditure that more than
offset the decline in the development expenditure.

According to the report, inflation stubbornly kept an upward trajectory. Despite several rounds of
policy rate hike since January 2018, the average CPI inflation during Jul-Mar FY19 exceeded the full year
target. Although demand-pull pressures lessened in intensity towards the end of FY19, the Non-Food
Non-Energy component continued to climb due to second round impact of exchange rate deprecation
and increase in energy prices.

On the external front, the current account deficit (CAD) declined on the back of lower import payments
for both goods and services, and a decent growth in workers’ remittances. However, given the elevated
level of CAD and insufficient foreign investments to fill the financing gap, the country had to resort to
bilateral and commercial sources for external financing.

The report features a special section on power tariffs in Pakistan. The analysis explains the process of
power tariff determination in the country and assesses why tariffs have not softened despite the
decline in fuel cost. It suggests that capacity payments constitute the bulk of power tariffs in Pakistan,
and a sharp increase in these payments in recent years has completely offset gains from declining fuel
cost.

The report also contains another special section on the outlook of food security in Pakistan. The analysis
emphasizes the related challenges that the country may face going forward, such as a high population
growth and unfavorable water and climatic conditions, unless remedial measures are taken urgently.

RCG Asia conference--Governor SBP for expanding work done on resolution framework

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has outlined his outlook for the Regional
Consultative Group Asia (RCG Asia) and suggested that the RCG expand on the work done so far on
resolution framework as well as financial safety nets. “These initiatives will enable the member countries to
exchange fruitful ideas in order to get critical insight on these issues’, he added.

He was co-chairing the g” meeting of Financial Stability Board- Regional Consultative Group for Asia
(FSB-RCG Asia) alongside Mr. Norman T.L.Chan of Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The meeting was
held in Hong Kong SAR today on October 20, 2015.

In July 2015, Governor Wathra was appointed as the co-chair of Financial Stability Board- Regional
Consultative Group for Asia (FSB-RCG Asia) along with Mr Norman T.L. Chan of Hong Kong Monetary
Authority for a two-year term. The co-chairs are responsible for hosting RCG Asia meetings, conducting
workshops, coordinating with the FSB Secretariat, and attending FSB Plenary meetings.

FSB has been established to coordinate, at international level, the work of national financial authorities and
international standard setting bodies and to develop and promote the implementation of effective regulatory,
supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. In addition to its own
member countries, FSB through six regional consultative groups (RCGs) conducts outreach with another
approximately 65 jurisdictions. Formed in 2011, the RCG Asia includes central banks and financial
authorities of 16 countries.

During the welcoming remarks, the Governor also commented on sessions pertaining to retrenchment of
correspondent banking, wholesale market conduct, and deposit insurance.

During the meetings, the RCG Asia members discussed issues pertaining to vulnerabilities and financial
stability including global and regional developments. Further, they discussed market-based financing and
asset Management activities along with associated risks. Members also deliberated upon the potential
retrenchment of correspondent banking by large international banks in certain regions and for certain types
of clients. Moreover, members also considered fair and effective wholesale market conduct, wherein the
discussion focused on deficiencies in fixed income, currency and commodity markets practices.

Meeting was concluded with a session focusing on changes to deposit insurance systems (DISs) resulting
from the global financial crisis. The crisis resulted in greater convergence in practices across jurisdictions.

FSB has issued a detailed press release about the proceedings of the gh meeting, which can be accessed on
its website at www. financialstabilityboard.org

Relaxation in Foreign Exchange Regulations to Facilitate Imports Against Advance Payment
and Open Account Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

 

SBP has allowed all federal and provincial government departments, hospitals in public and
private sectors, charitable organizations, manufacturers and commercial importers to make Import
Advance Payment and Import on Open Account, without any limit, for the import of medical
equipments, medicines and other ancillary items for the treatment of COVID-19. Further, the banks
have been allowed to approve Electronic Import Form (EIF) for import of the equipments, donated by
international donor agencies and foreign governments to facilitate their seamless and speedy

imports.

Number of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan are increasing. An effective strategy to fight against
the menace of COVID-19 requires timely availability of needed equipments. In the backdrop of
unprecedented spread of the deadly virus, SBP has taken these measures to facilitate the import of
much needed equipment in a seamless manner. SBP has also accordingly revised its existing foreign

exchange regulations for import of goods against Advance Payment and Open Account.

State Bank as a responsible state institution would continue to provide its needed support in

nation’s drive to fight against the menace of COVID-19.

The State Bank of Pakistan/SBP Banking Services Corporation will neither exchange nor be liable
to pay any value of such banknote to any person or a bank after the above mentioned deadline as from

SBP Banking Services Corporation have been advised to prominently display the dates of demonetization
and acceptability of Rs. 500 old-design (bigger size) banknote at visible places in all their branches.

SBP’s instructions to all banks and other related material in this regard are also available at SBP’s
website. For creating awareness about the demonetization and exchange of Rs. 500 old design (bigger
size) banknote, a media campaign has already been started.

With a view to redressing the public grievances in exchange of Rs 500 old design banknote, SBP
BSC has also established a central Help Desk at its Head Office in Karachi which may be contacted at
telephone numbers: 021-99212491, 021-32455454 & 021-32455470. Complaints may also be lodged at

SBP rejects estimates of USS$4.9 billion remittances from Pakistan to India

State Bank of Pakistan has taken note of a report suggesting an outflow of USS 4.9 billion
from Pakistan to India as remittances. This number is given in Migration and Remittances
Factbook 2016 prepared by the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and
Development (KNOMAD).

At the outset, it must be noted that the Factbook data on bilateral remittance flows are
estimates (not the actual flows), which are based on a number of assumptions about migrant
stock, per worker income, etc. The methodology used to estimate these numbers is based on
a World Bank’s Working Paper by Ratha, Dilip, and William Shaw ( South-South migration and
remittances. No. 102. World Bank Publications, 2007). This methodology has serious issues,
particularly in case of Pakistan, as also acknowledged by the authors themselves stating that

“Interpreting the meaning of migrant stocks also presents some difficulties. Pakistanis in
India and Russians in Ukraine became migrants following partition of the original country.”
Thus the study is clearly flawed as the migrants at the time of Indo-Pak partition in 1947 had
become citizens of Pakistan. Therefore, SBP categorically rejects such estimates as these are

contrary to facts and do not make sense.

The actual Balance of Payments data shows that outflow of workers’ remittances from
Pakistan to India were USS 116 thousands in FY16 and the inflows from India to Pakistan
were USS 329 thousands. The value of Pakistan’s exports to India was US$425 million, while

imports from India amounted to USS 1,415 million, during FY16 .

SBP issues guidelines for banking services to visually impaired/blind persons.

State Bank of Pakistan has issued guidelines for banks to facilitate banking services to visually
impaired/blind persons. In order to provide equitable access to banking services, general guidelines
have been framed which contain instructions pertaining to opening and operation of bank account, cash
withdrawal/cheque book facility, Credit Cards, ATM/Debit Cards, phone/internet banking, lockers and
extension of loans.

According to the SBP, across advance global financial jurisdictions, it is illegal to discriminate against
anyone on the basis of disability. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities and Optional Protocol (UNCRPD), to which Pakistan is a ratified signatory since 2011, clearly
commits to the rights of persons with disability and their access to financial services. The Constitution of
Pakistan also provides that all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of
law. Accordingly, it is obligatory on the banks/Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) to make banking/financial
services accessible for people with disabilities especially those who are visually impaired/ blind.

To facilitate these services banks/MFBs have been instructed to arrange printing of all related
stationery, forms/documents etc. in Braille Script within the period of three months from the date of
issuance of the guidelines; make available related stock of stationery at least in a branch of
region/city/town from where the said stock may be procured as and when required by other nearby
branches. Banks are encouraged to collaborate with each other and ensure that in an area where
various banks/MFBs are operating , at least one branch is having Talking ATM for facilitation of visually
challenged persons;

Further details for banks/MFBs and other stakeholders have been provided at SBP’s website.

Agreement to initiate collection of Government taxes
and duties through internet banking and ATM

 

State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Board of Revenue and 1-Link have signed an agreement in
Islamabad today to develop a mechanism enabling public to pay FBR taxes and customs duty
using internet banking or ATMs. The signing ceremony was chaired by Finance Minister Mr.
Muhammad Ishaq Dar. The Advisor to the Prime Minister on Revenue, Mr. Haroon Akhtar
Khan was also present in the ceremony.

The facility would be available round the clock /7 days a week. As per the proposed mechanism
the banks will add FBR (Inland Revenue) and FBR (Customs) as Billers in the Billers Module and
develop necessary interface with 1-Link. After the system is made operational, the tax
payers/importers will fill their tax and custom duty payment details in the FBR (IRS) and
Customs (WeBOC) online modules to generate payment slip ID (PSID). The PSID will then be
used to access the tax/duty payment details on banks’ webpage or ATM as the case may be.
The tax payer or their agent will then pay the tax by debiting his/her bank account for onward
credit to the respective government account in SBP BSC. The whole process will be online and
fully automated.

The SBP has also advised banks to add FBR and Customs as Billers in the Bill Payment System
offered by 1-link and develop necessary integration with 1-link within 2 months i.e. by 5th
December 2017. The system will be made operational by 31st December 2017 after necessary
testing. The banks have been advised to demonstrate full ownership and commitment for
successful and timely implementation of this strategically important project, which will bring
huge efficiency gains besides facilitating the public in hassle free payment of government taxes
and duties.

The Finance Minister Mr. Muhammad Ishaq Dar on the occasion congratulated State Bank and
FBR for initiating such an important project, which would revolutionize the government tax
collection mechanism. He expressed hope that all the formalities would be completed at the
earliest and that the system would be operational by 31° December, 2017. The Governor SBP
added that the initiative is part of SBP Vision 2020, which envisages development of the robust
payment system and it’s primarily aimed at facilitating the tax payers and public at large in
payment of taxes. The Chairman FBR, Mr. Tariq Mehmood Pasha, on the occasion said that the
project is the result of collaboration and cooperation between FBR, SBP and the private sector
and will go a long way in further improving the government tax collection systems.

Record high workers’ remittances received in June 2020

Workers’ remittances rose by a significant 50.7% during June 2020 to reach record high USD
2,466.2 million compared with USD 1,636.4 million in June 2019. Similarly, on a cumulative
basis, workers’ remittances increased to a historic high level of USD 23,120.7 million during
FY20, witnessing a growth of 6.4% over USD 21,739.4 million during FY19. It would also be
pertinent to mention here that inflow of workers’ remittances registered an increase of a 7.8%
during March-June 2020 pandemic period compared with the corresponding period of 2019.

During June 2020, larger amounts of Workers' Remittances are received from Saudi Arabia (US $ 619.4
million), USA (US $ 452.0 million), UAE (US $ 431.7 million) and UK (US $ 401.0 million) recording an
increase of 42.0 percent, 7.1 percent, 33.5 percent and 40.8 percent respectively as compared to May,
2020.

The significant increase in remittances during June 2020 can be attributed to a number of
factors. Since many of the countries eased lockdown in June, overseas Pakistanis were able to
transfer accumulative funds, which they were unable to send earlier. Further, it is also
believed that they sent remittances to support extended families and friends due to COVID-
19,

In addition to these, efforts by the Government and SBP also played their role in the increased
inflow of workers’ remittances during FY20 in general and Covid-19 period, March till June
2020, in particular. Supportive government policies in terms of extension of Reimbursement
of TT Charges Scheme (Free Send Remittance Scheme) to small remitters by reducing threshold
from USD 200 to USD 100, as well as, broadening the scope of incentive scheme for marketing
scheme for financial institutions increased the incentives for sending remittances through
regular channels. Further, on-boarding of a large number of technology based money transfer
companies by SBP and PRI also helped absorb the shock of lockdowns. Financial institutions
were motivated to use effective marketing campaigns with particular focus on digital channels
for sending and receiving remittances to promote the use of legal channels.

State Bank issues guidelines
for uniform cheque printing standard

State Bank of Pakistan has decided to implement a uniform standard for cheque printing across
the banking industry in Pakistan and prescribed guidelines relating to the layout of cheques. June
30, 2014 has been set as the deadline for implementation of the standard.

In a circular, SBP has advised all banks and financial institutions to arrange new cheque books as
per the new standard upon the exhaustion of existing stock or by the deadline, whichever comes
earlier, and to issue only the new standardized cheque books after the said date.

Banks and financial institutions have further been directed to ensure that clearing stamps are
affixed on the reverse side of the cheque, not on the obverse, so that no material part of the
cheque is defaced. SBP advised banks to ensure that the size of stamp is in accordance with the
requirements of new standards.

The circular advises the banks and financial institutions to take all possible steps for creating
awareness and educating their customers and staff about the new standards and instructions, and
encourage their customers to replace their old unused stock of cheque with new standardized
cheque books.

The new cheque layout standards have been developed after extensive consultations with the
relevant stakeholders and are based on international standards.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has directed all commercial banks and the field offices

State Bank denies issuing any press note on fake currency

State Bank of Pakistan has categorically rejected the news item appearing in a section of press
relating to circulation of counterfeit currency notes of denomination of Rs 500, Rs 1000, and
Rs 5000 in the market by unscrupulous elements. In a statement issued to print and electronic
media SBP spokesman said the news item directly refers to a press note issued by State Bank
of Pakistan which is factually incorrect. The spokesman further said that SBP issues press
releases to all media organizations and also posts them on its website.

Spokesman has requested the media that they may like to check the factual position from State
Banks spokesman before publishing information relating to such matters having impact on
general public and sensitive economic matters.

Preliminary macroeconomic data signals a stable growth momentum
during the year — says SBP report

State Bank of Pakistan has today released its First Quarterly Report for FY17 on the State of Pakistan’s
Economy. According to the report, preliminary macroeconomic data signals a stable growth momentum
during the year.

According to the report, a strong growth in sugarcane and maize production, improved production of
cotton, and better supplies of minor crops suggest some recovery in the agriculture growth. While
acknowledging the subdued performance by large-scale manufacturing (LSM) in Q1-FY17, the report
expected that the growth would gain some pace going forward, on the back of supporting policies and
encouraging outlook for automobile, sugar, pharmaceuticals and construction-related sectors.

The report also noted the increase in the average headline CPI inflation from 1.7 percent in Q1-FY16 to
3.9 percent in Q1-FY17. According to the report, this increase was expected as inflation had already
dipped to ultra-lows last year; further push came from supply-side factors, which included a gradual rise
in international prices of some key commodities. For the full-year, the CPI inflation is expected to
remain within the target of 6 percent for the year.

According to the report, the large retirement of private sector credit in Q1-FY17 was commensurate
with an extraordinary off-take during the month of June 2016. Moreover, a few large corporates also
remained shy from borrowing despite the historic low interest rates. A positive development, however,
was the higher loan demand for fixed investment purposes, particularly for energy-related capital
expenditures.

The report highlighted the increase in fiscal and current account deficits in the first quarter, and pointed
out that this YoY increase was driven primarily by the absence of inflows under Coalition Support Fund
(CSF). In case of the current account, additional pressure came from a widening trade deficit (with rising
imports and declining exports) and a fall in workers’ remittances - the first such decline in the past 14
quarters.

On fiscal side, the report noted that the decline in non-tax revenues and lower than expected tax
collections, contributed towards a rise in the deficit during Q1-FY17. However, the report appreciated
the marginal decline in current expenditures following the cut down in subsidies by the government.
Interest payments remained unchanged as the gains realized from low interest rates were largely offset
by an accumulation of public debt stock. Furthermore, the report also positively views the increase of
12.4 percent YoY in development expenditures, especially by provinces that scaled up their
infrastructure spending during the quarter.

Finally, the report reiterated the role of private businesses for higher growth. In particular, fiscal
incentives announced by the government in the FY17 budget and a historic low policy rate offer private
businesses an opportunity to demonstrate that they can compete with their peers in other emerging
markets and contribute to the growth momentum of Pakistan’s economy.

SBP conducts a review of complaints against Banks/DFIs/MFBs from 2016 to 2019

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has conducted a four year (2016-2019) review of complaints against
Banks/MFBs/DFls. The objective of the review was to gain insights on effectiveness of complaint
management at banks. The salient features of the review are being published to emphasize SBP’s
narrative that responsible complaint handling is the core element of Fair Treatment of Consumer (FTC).

This review is conducted in addition to various regulatory measures to enhance consumer grievance
handling in the industry including the issuance of detailed guidelines on complaint management at
banks and self-assessment framework.

It is pertinent to mention here that responsible banking conduct and FTC is one of the key regulatory
agendas of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). SBP recognizes that effective and efficient consumer
grievance handling mechanisms are crucial elements of FTC regime, therefore, it considers consumer
complaints as an opportunity to improve banking services and increase customer satisfaction.

The review indicates that complaints against banks during past four years have increased from 774,656
in 2016 to 1,549,837 in 2019. This increase can be attributed to improved visibility and access of
dispute resolution mechanism coupled with enhanced consumer awareness. Further, this is also due
to the fact that number and value of banking transactions have increased substantially. For instance,
the volume and value of ATM/debit card transactions have increased by 101% and 110% respectively
over the reporting period. The number of deposit accounts per ATM and per branch shows increase of
62% and 81% respectively. Similarly, during 2016 to 2019, volume and value of E-banking transactions
have substantially increased by 112% and 152% respectively on account of 71% increase in E-banking
users. Moreover, credit card related transactions increased from 18 to 39 million showing an increase
of 118% over a span of 4 years. Accordingly, the increase in complaints over the same period can be
witnessed as concentrated in ATM/Debit Card, Account maintenance, E- Banking and Credit Cards.

In terms of addressing the complaints, the resolution rate over the period 2016-2019 remained above
97% at each year's end. The average time taken for resolution of complaints remained within regulatory
turn around times. However, delays were observed in sending acknowledgments, interim and final
responses.

It may be mentioned here that banks being the first forum of redressal, have been handling 97% and
above of the total complaints of the industry while less than 3% of complaints were escalated at higher
levels including State Bank of Pakistan, Banking Mohtasib, and Pakistan Citizen Portal established by
the Prime Minister Delivery Unit.

In order to boost performance of complaint handling at banks and promote competition, SBP plans to
further enhance the related disclosures which may include publishing of bank-wise complaint handling

Revision of Guidelines on Stress Testing of the Banking Sector

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has today released a revised suite of Guidelines on Stress Testing, which
replaces the earlier guidelines issued in 2012. Stress testing is a key tool used globally by banks for risk
management and capital planning. Accordingly, the revised guidelines will further strengthen the risk
management capacity of the banks, Development Finance Institutions (DFls) and Micro-Finance Banks
(MEBs), in line with evolving international best practices and changing local economic and financial
dynamics.

The scope of revised guidelines has been broadened to incorporate guidance on Macro-stress Testing
(MST), besides the Sensitivity Analysis (SA) with an enhanced number of shock scenarios. In terms of
coverage, besides banks/DFls, the Islamic Banks/Islamic Banking Branches (IBs/IBBs) and MFBs will also
perform SA exercise. Further, the Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) will be required to
conduct MST annually, which will facilitate in improving the supervision and monitoring of these large
sized banks. Moreover, the data submission requirements have been rationalized and financial institutions
will now be required to furnish data on a minimal number of variables.

The guidelines also envisage supervisory engagement with banks based on SBP’s in-house assessment to
ensure that appropriate risk mitigation measures are taken for strengthening the resilience of the
individual institutions and the banking system. The guidelines can be accessed at the following link:

SBP enhances scope of refinance facility to support health facilities

On 17° March, 2020, SBP introduced a refinance scheme, titled Refinance Facility to Combat
Covid-19 (RFCC), to support the hospitals and health sector for providing services to directly
fight against Covid-19. Under this scheme, banks provide concessional loans at a maximum
end-user rate of 3 percent for 5 years for hospitals and medical centers to purchase medical
equipment and set up isolation wards for developing capacity and supporting the health sector
in fight against COVID-19. Since its inception up till 2"" July 2020, Rs 6.4 billion of concessional
credit have been approved for hospitals and other eligible facilities to fight COVID-19.

Keeping in view the encouraging response and the potential to help developing the health
facilities in the country, SBP has now expanded the scope of this refinance facility further.
The scheme now allows manufacturers of protective gears and equipment, including items
such as masks, dresses, testing kits, hospital beds, ventilators etc. to avail financing under
RFCC. Moreover, to cope with the rising needs of the health facilities in general in the
country, SBP has allowed hospitals serving patients even other than COVID-19 to avail this
facility. Refinance facility will be available for setting up or expansion of the existing hospitals
fulfilling minimum specified standards. For setting up new hospitals under this scheme,
payments will be released by the banks on completing relevant milestones. Details are
provided in the circular at: http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL16.htm

RFCC is highly subsidized facility where SBP provides refinance to banks at 0% whereas banks
can keep a maximum margin of 3%. Some of the banks treating this as part of their CSR are
keeping margins very low.

Banks performance under SBP Rozgar Refinance Scheme supported by
Government of Pakistan’s Risk Sharing Facility

On April 10, 2020 State Bank of Pakistan introduced a refinance scheme to provide
concessional credit at 3% interest rate and generous repayment terms to any business that
commits to not lay off workers for 3 months. The goal of the scheme was to provide an
incentive to businesses to protect jobs. On May 06, 2020 SBP complemented this scheme with
a 40% percent risk sharing facility (RSF) on first loss basis from the Government of Pakistan for
utilization of this scheme for SMEs and small corporates (defined as business with annual
turnover not exceeding Rs. 2 billion). As of June 12, 2020 there has been significant take up in
the scheme. Banks have approved loan applications worth Rs. 107.5 billion of which Rs. 23.5
billion is for SMEs and small corporates under the risk sharing facility.

Amongst the banks there is considerable difference in the extent to which they have provided
credit under the RSF. Some have been more active than others. This note provides to the public
bank-level information on two key areas: (a) total amount of loans provided by the bank under
the scheme to SMEs and small corporates and (b) the loan amount approved by the bank in
percent of the loan amount applied (acceptance ratio). The goal of this note is to promote the
use of this scheme and to recognize banks that have been most active in providing credit to
SMEs and small corporates under this scheme. The public may find such information useful.

It should be noted that this note provides information only on the data related to credit to
SMEs and small corporates. The rankings of the banks may be different when also using the
data for lending to large corporates as some banks may be more focused on serving those
segments of the market. It should also be noted that these figures focus only on lending under
the Rozgar Refinancing scheme. Some banks may be more active in other forms of SME lending
which would not be reflected in the figures below.

Performance of Banks w.r.t Approved Financing Amount

Review of data indicates that five banks (Top Performing Five Banks) together constitute more
than 61 percent share of overall approved financing amount under the Risk Sharing Facility
(RSF) with JS Bank Limited at the top, followed by HBL and Bank Al-Habib. The chart of Least
Performing Five Banks depicts the bottom pyramid of banks that have lagged other banks in
extending financing under this risk sharing scheme. This list includes two big banks.

SBP and WB ink agreement on Technical Cooperation for achieving SBP's Strategic Goals

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the World Bank (WB) inked an agreement on Technical Cooperation
for achieving the Strategic Goals under SBP’s Vision 2020 on January 28, 2017. This is the first such
agreement signed by the World Bank on Reimbursable Advisory Services(RAS) with any country in
South Asia Region. The signing ceremony was held after a meeting between Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf
Mahmood Wathra and CEO World Bank Ms. Kristalina Georgieva at a local hotel in Karachi.

SBP Strategic Plan (2016-2020) has been framed and built around to focus on resolution of
strategically important issues facing Pakistan’s economy and financial sector. While Pakistan has
made significant improvements in its economic fundamentals in recent years, the SBP Strategic Plan
has been developed against a backdrop of continuing challenges and a need to foster a greater
intermediation role for the financial sector.

The six strategic goals of SBP aim to Enhance monetary policy; Strengthen the financial system
stability regime; Improve the efficiency, effectiveness & fairness of the banking system; Increase
financial inclusion; Develop robust payments systems; & Strengthen SBP’s organizational efficiency
and effectiveness.

The World Bank’s engagement in the financial sector is a combination of financial, advisory,
knowledge, and convening services, and is complemented by investments and private sector
engagement by International Finance Corporation (IFC). Under the agreement, SBP and the World
Bank have agreed on a well-defined work program, including specific outputs.

The technical cooperation program is anticipated to have several components such as Development
and implementation of a Risk Based Supervision framework; implementation of an Enterprise Risk
Management framework; strengthening of cybersecurity etc. The program will have an initial
duration of three years, with yearly reviews to discuss overall effectiveness of the program, monitor
deliverables and the achievement of results.

SBP releases Second Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its Second Quarterly Report for FY20 on the State of
Pakistan’s Economy. According to the report, the stabilization efforts and regulatory measures yielded
notable improvements during the first half of FY20. The current account deficit contracted to a six-year
low, foreign exchange reserves increased, the primary budget recorded a surplus, and core inflation
eased. Importantly, export-based manufacturing showed signs of traction and construction activities
picked up, indicating that the economy was on the path of recovery. Progress under the IMF program
remained on track and the credit rating agencies maintained their stable outlook for Pakistan during
the review period. Further improvements will require deep structural reforms to put the economy on
a firm path towards sustainable growth.

In case of balance of payments, the report noted that the improvement in current account mostly
stemmed from a reduction in the import bill with some contribution from export earnings. Depressed
international commodity prices had partially offset the gains in export volumes offered by a
competitive exchange rate. With the exception of the telecommunications sector, foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows were also about the same level as last year. The report emphasized that
reforms needed to be prioritized to attract and sustain higher FDI inflows into the country.

Regarding the fiscal sector, the report noted that the primary budget recorded a surplus, while the
fiscal deficit was contained during H1-FY20 compared to the same period last year. This was due to a
significant growth in revenues despite a slowdown in the economy and the compression in imports.
The reversal of earlier tax concessions and implementation of new levies helped increase the revenue
collection. Nonetheless, the overall revenue target was missed, highlighting the scope for greater
efforts to broaden the tax base and increase documentation in the economy.

The report further highlighted the challenges pertaining to the agriculture sector. The sector appears
less resilient to challenges like constrained water availability and climate change. The cotton crop, in
particular, was hit by unfavorable weather, pest attacks and low water availability. Though the
prospects for the wheat crop and livestock are encouraging, the decline in cotton production is likely
to undermine the agriculture sector’s performance in FY20.

On the inflation front, the report noted that the inflationary pressures continued to build up throughout
the first half of FY20. While the non-food-non-energy (NFNE) inflation exhibited stability amid subdued
demand conditions in the economy, food inflation surged steeply in both the quarters. Given that the
surge in inflationary pressures was mostly an outcome of supply disruptions, which are typically
seasonal and temporary and core inflation did not rise by a commensurate amount, the SBP’s
projections for the average headline inflation for FY20 remained broadly unchanged at 11-12 percent.
This was one of the major reasons the Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate
unchanged during both its September and November meetings during the first half of FY20.

To ensure that the stabilization measures lead to a sustainable growth path for the country, the report
emphasizes that the ongoing efforts must be complemented with further structural reforms. In this
regard, the Special Section of the report identifies the state of competition in the domestic economy
as an area needing attention of the policymakers. It assesses the current state of competition in the

SBP allows use of message type MT 102 in Pakistan
Real time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM) system

In order to ensure timely interbank domestic transfer of home remittances under the
arrangement of Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) SBP has decided to allow the use of
message type MT 102 in Pakistan Real time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM)
system, free of charge.

Remitting banks availing this facility shall ensure that For remittances received in Pakistan on
a working day from 9 am till 3 pm, the payment is transferred to the beneficiary bank via
PRISM within two hours of the receipt of advice from abroad.

For remittances received in Pakistan after 3 pm till 9 am next working day, the payment shall
be transferred to the beneficiary bank by 11 am via PRISM. In case of holiday, the same shall
be credited on the next working day before 11am.

After receiving funds via PRISM, beneficiary banks shall ensure that their customers’
accounts are credited within 2 hours. Further, in case of any discrepancy or dispute, the
beneficiary bank shall inform the Remitting bank about the discrepancy, within two hours.
The remitting bank shall rectify the discrepancy by the next working day.

To ensure that full benefits of this facility reach the beneficiaries of home remittances, banks
are also advised to take all necessary steps for implementation of the subject mechanism
including, but not limited to Implementing Straight-Through-Processing (STP) with the PRISM
system for automating the process of crediting beneficiaries’ accounts in real-time and
launching awareness campaigns for the use of IBAN in remittance-related messages for both,
foreign tie-ups and customers to reduce transcription errors in payment messages.

Banks shall ensure the compliance of all legal and regulatory guidelines including compliance
of AML/ CFT and exchange regulations.

Banks are advised to make necessary arrangements to comply with the instructions on
priority basis by March 31, 2016.

PKR -USS exchange rate adjusts in the interbank market

Today, the PKR-USS exchange rate in the interbank market closed at Rs 107 per USS. During the day,
PKR depicted high and low of Rs.109.50 and Rs.105.55 respectively

Almost half way into the current fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy is well positioned to achieve the real
GDP growth target of 6 percent in 2017-18. This positive outlook is supported by a broad-based 8.4%
growth in Large Scale Manufacturing during the first quarter of the year, and encouraging assessment
of major crops, while services are likely to benefit from the positive spillovers of the growing
commodity sector. Strong growth in private sector credit, particularly in fixed investment loans, also
reflects the dynamism in the real economic activity. Moreover, inflation continues to remain low and
stable, and stood at 3.6 percent during the first five months of the year.

On external front, exports recorded a double-digit growth during Jul-Oct FY18; Foreign Direct
Investment reached a nine-year high; and workers’ remittances posted a modest growth. However,
the continuation of high growth in imports led to a widening of current account deficit, and
consequently to depletion in the country’s foreign exchange reserves. These pressures have
persisted leading to the adjustment in inter-bank exchange rate. This movement in the exchange rate
is based on demand and supply of foreign exchange in the interbank market.

SBP is of the view that this market-driven adjustment in the exchange rate will contain the imbalance
in the external account and sustain higher growth trajectory. The exchange rate will continue to
reflect the demand and supply conditions; and SBP stands ready to intervene, in case speculative
and/or momentary pressures emerge, for smooth functioning of the foreign exchange markets.

The macroeconomic imbalances have impacted some segments

of the financial sector, says the SBP’s Financial Stability Review for CY18

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued today its flagship annual publication viz., Financial
Stability Review (FSR) for the calendar year 2018. The Review presents performance and risk
assessment of various segments of the financial sector including banking, non-banking financial
institutions, financial markets, exchange companies, non-financial corporates and financial market
infrastructure. In addition, it discusses the possible implications of the appraised risks to the overall
stability of the financial sector.

FSR suggests that the CY18 has been a challenging year for the financial sector of Pakistan. The
macroeconomic vulnerabilities emerging from twin deficits and elevated inflation level have
necessitated the stabilization measures that have slowed down the pace of economic growth. The
financial markets, particularly, the forex and equity markets have trended downwards with increased
volatility. Accordingly, the growth of the financial sector has moderated to 7.5 percent in CY18.
Similarly, the financial depth, as measured by financial assets to GDP ratio, has subsided to 73.0
percent in CY18 from 74.5 percent a year earlier. However, the financial institutions and financial
market infrastructure have largely remained resilient and performed steadily during the year under
review.

Among the financial institutions, banking sector has remained resilient, with strong Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) of 16.2 percent—well above the minimum regulatory level of 11.9 percent—and high
fund-based liquidity. Among various factors, rise in rating culture in the corporate sector has
facilitated enhancement in CAR. The financial intermediation has improved with a rise in advances to
deposit ratio to 55.8 percent, highest in the last eight years. Growing advances have helped reduce
the gross loans to NPLs ratio, but other asset quality indicators have slightly deteriorated due to rise
in the quantum of NPLs during CY18. The banks have posted reasonable profits; however, higher
provisioning expense along with rise in administrative cost and one-off extra ordinary expense has
kept the profitability slightly below the last year’s level. Encouragingly, increase in the share of
interest income from financing activity has improved the Net Interest Margin (NIM), which has been
falling for the last 3 years.

The FSR has also highlighted few challenges facing the banking sector. The deceleration in deposit
growth that is continuing over the last few years may pose funding risk for asset expansion. The
concentration of banks’ exposure to public sector, though reduced due to net retirement in PIBs in
CY18, remains significant. Further, the risks related to AML/CFT and cyber security need continuous
attention for mitigation. Encouragingly, resilience analysis indicates that the banking sector has the
capacity to absorb adverse domestic and global stress in the medium-term.

The Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) have maintained fast growth trajectory and now constitute 13.5
percent of the total banking sector assets. This growth is, primarily, driven by broad based financing
activity to various economic sectors, with majority of financing extended under profit and loss sharing
modes of Musharika and Diminishing Musharika. While financial health of IBls remains sound, they
continue to face dearth of Shariah compliant investment avenues that limit their ability to effectively
manage their liquidity as well as mobilize deposits.

SBP calls meeting of Chambers of Commerce to seek input
on Automation of Tax Refunds Project

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir held an online meeting with the business
community today to seek feedback on an ongoing project of automation of payment of tax
refunds by SBP. The meeting was attended by the office bearers of Pakistan Business Council
(PBC), Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FPCCI) and Chambers of
Commerce and Industries of various cities.

Governor SBP in his opening remarks introduced SBP’s Automation of Payment of Tax Refunds
Project saying that after automation of government’s revenue collections, efforts are
underway by SBP to automate the government’s payments to ensure transparency, efficiency
and public convenience. He said that improving ease of doing business is one of the shared
goals of the government and SBP for its significant potential impact on boosting economic
activity in the country. Governor Baqir remarked that Automation of payment of Tax Refunds
Project is a part of SBP efforts in this direction in collaboration with FBR and Pakistan Customs.
Adding further, he said that since the project is ultimately going to benefit the businesses, it is
important that the system is developed in consultation with all the stakeholders including the
businesses. He emphasized that, in this regard, feedback of businesses is very important since
they are the key stakeholders.

A senior SBP official gave a detailed presentation on the project elaborating that the project
constituted two broader components, automation of payment of duty drawback claims and
the automation of payment of sales tax refunds. After highlighting the issues in the existing
mechanisms he explained that how the automation will simplify the processes and bring
efficiency in terms of time saving and human resources. He highlighted that there will be
minimal human intervention in processing and payment of refund claims as the system
generated payment messages will be sent to SBP on real time basis through an interface
between FBR/Pakistan Customs and SBP for crediting the funds in the claimants’ account.

The representatives of Chambers of Commerce appreciated the initiative of SBP and provided
valuable feedback. They also assured their cooperation to SBP in the development of this
project of national importance.

SBP organizes lecture on State Capacities for Delivering Higher
Economic Growth

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) organized the 21° Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture at a local hotel in
Karachi on December 12, 2016. Professor Timothy John Besley the W. Arthur Lewis Professor of
Development Economics and Political Science at London School of Economics (LSE), UK, delivered
the memorial lecture titled, “State Capacities for Delivering Higher Economic Growth”.

In his lecture, professor Besley shed light on the role of state capacities stimulating economic growth.
He defined the state capacities as “the forms of capital which make the government work more
effectively”. He discussed three types of state capacity namely fiscal capacity, legal capacity and
collective capacity. He argued that these capacities are built up over time, co-evolve and complement
each other. He explained the process the fiscal capacity supports legal capacity; the legal capacity
supports collective capacity and then collective capacity supports fiscal capacity completing the loop.

The lecture also explains what stops incumbent government investing in its capacity building. One
reason is that benefits can only be harnessed in the long run, while their tenures are short. He showed
those countries having established strong constraints on the executives end up with political peace and
coherence of the society. Thus by reducing the cost of investment on capacity building achieved higher
development level. Strong executive constraints can provide insurance against poor decisions by the
executive, electing low quality executive policy makers and reduce the downside risks. He argued that
countries with strong executive constraints have long historical struggle to reach there. In this regard
the supportive norms and values are also important along with establishment of rule-based governance.
At the end of his lecture professor Besley provided a frame showing the future trajectory of Pakistan.

Earlier, in his inaugural address Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra
introduced the guest speaker and recounted his achievements in the field of economic research and
policy making. Governor emphasized the role of strong and quality institutions, efficient allocation of
resources, promotion and protection of new knowledge and infrastructure development in furthering
the growth agenda of the state. He also highlighted the role of State Bank of Pakistan in solidifying
state efforts to achieve a higher and sustainable economic growth in Pakistan. “In fact, SBP is one of
the few central banks having economic development as part of its mandated act”, said the governor.

It may be mentioned here that on the occasion of silver jubilee of State Bank of Pakistan in 1973, the
Central Board of Directors decided to institute an annual series of lectures delivered by eminent
economists and financial experts and to name the series after the bank's first Governor Zahid Husain.
In 21"" lecture of the series, high officials of the government of Pakistan, faculty members of various
universities and bankers also attended the lecture.

Justice (retd) Mr. Nasir Aslam Zahid, son of (late) Mr. Zahid Husain graced the occasion as chief
guest. A short video in the beginning was also shown to the audience that familiarized them with the
achievements of (late) Zahid Husain and his role in providing foundation and nurturing a vibrant
financial system in Pakistan.

SBP Governor discusses Banking Sector Strategy with bankers

The State Bank Governor, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar called upon Presidents of all commercial banks
to make concerted efforts to increase access to financial services in the country. She was
chairing a meeting in which she launched the future banking sector strategy paper.

The strategy paper for banking sector reforms over the next decade has been formulated by the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) after intensive consultation with the stakeholders including
valuable feedback from the foreign reputable experts. The Banking Sector Strategy (BSS) is
centered on reforms involving the SBP and the banking sector, which constitutes not only the
core of the financial system in Pakistan but is also central to the monetary and financial stability
responsibilities of the SBP. The BSS focuses on reforms that the SBP has the power and
resources to implement or substantially influence and highlights a set of priority areas in which
progress needs to be made in the next ten years. The ten key priority areas for the BSS are to:

(i) Implement a financial inclusion program for banks to meet the needs of underserved
economic subsectors, including outreach programs to meet the requirements of the
agriculture, housing, SME and microfinance sectors.

(ii) Strengthen consumer protection through new legislation, codes of conduct and new
institutional arrangements and improve financial education through educational
outreach programs.

(iii) Strengthen competition and efficiency in the banking sector with more transparency,
more diversification with new products and delivery channels as well as measures to
reduce the market distortions created by the large banks in rural areas.

(iv) Further strengthen and consolidate the banking sector by continued efforts to raise
governance and risk management standards, higher capital requirements and resolution
of underperforming commercial and specialized banks.

(v) Strengthen prudential regulations and supervision by updating banking legislation and
regulations, methods of supervision, and stricter enforcement of prudential rules for all
banks, including state-owned ones.

(vi) Introduce a framework for consolidated supervision and reorganize the regulatory
architecture to allow better regulation and supervision of financial groups and
conglomerates.

PAKISTAN TO ACHIEVE 28 bn. DOLLARS EXPORT
TARGET BY 2010: DR. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar has said that
Pakistan would be able to achieve its target of 28 billion US dollar exports in the year
2010. ‘In view of the past performance shown by Pakistan in exports (exports
increased by 8.6 billion in the past 5 years), a target of 28 billion US dollars in year
2010 was very much possible’, she added.

She made this observation while addressing the Expo 2006 Investment
Conference on ‘Pakistan Export Trends and Structure and Issues of Competitiveness’
which has been jointly organized by the State Bank of Pakistan and the Export
Promotion Bureau at a local hotel in Karachi today.

Dr. Akhtar stressed that export potential is high in areas such as, food
processing and milk processing, seafood, gem stones and software and IT services.
She also said that Pakistan has developed special export zones and clusters. If these
segments are effectively exploited, Pakistan will be able to realize its 2010 target.
She supplemented her optimism by pointing towards the continued foreign flows,
increased public investment for improvement in infrastructure, and greater trade
liberalization in the form of Preferential Trade Agreements. She emphasized that the
Pakistan has a road map for further deepening of reforms and addressing any policy,
legal and regulatory distortions which would ensure the continuation of recent strong
economic performance well into future.

She pointed out that Pakistan’s export structure in terms of share of value
added goods, both in the textile and non-textile sectors, has improved. However, she
also stressed that there is a further room for improvement. She also emphasized on the
importance of diversifying the international export markets of Pakistani products.

The Governor told the conference participants that the effectiveness of macro
economic reforms and the trade policies at the micro level (on firms operating in the
economy) is linked to strengthening of export competitiveness. However, a host of
other factors also impact competitiveness such as: a good business environment;
comparative advantage which a country has in various sectors; elimination of anti
export bias due to preference given to import substitution policies; and whether the
firms can actually combine the various factor inputs in a sophisticated and efficient
manner to come out with high quality products.

SBP to achieve the desired goal of
‘Banking for All’: Kazi Abdul Muktadir

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Kazi Abdul Muktadir has expressed his
resolve to provide banking services to all segments of the society. Addressing the journalists
during his visit to Karachi Press Club this afternoon, he said that with the concerted efforts of

all, we will be able to achieve the desired goal of ‘Banking for All’.

Emphasizing the need for an efficient and thriving banking system, he said that the State Bank is
providing regulatory environment to financial institutions to enhance financial inclusion in the
country. ‘Providing people with access to finance is a challenging task, not just for the central

bank but also for all the stakeholders,’ he observed.

State Bank of Pakistan is trying to make the banking services available at the door step of the
people, he said and added that promoting access to banking services is the corner stone of
SBP’s policy framework. He said the State Bank under its Branch Licencing Policy has made it
compulsory for banks to open at least 20% of their new branches in rural and under-served

areas.

He pointed out that Branchless Banking is helping in reaching out to the low income, unbanked
people through more than 30,000 access points throughout the country. Nearly 30 million
transactions worth Rs.115 billion have been processed during the fourth quarter of the last

fiscal year through branchless banking and the average daily transactions have been reported

SBP DENIES RUMOURS OF FREEZING OF FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTS

The State Bank of Pakistan has categorically denied rumours regarding
the freezing of foreign currency accounts and sealing of lockers at banks.

pointed out that foreign currency accounts are already enjoying protection under
Foreign Currency Accounts (Protection) Ordinance 2001. The general public is,
therefore, requested not to pay any attention to such rumours and continue their
business normally, the spokesman added.

PAKISTAN’S BANKING SYSTEM REMAINS UNHURT
BY RECENT FINANCIAL MARKET TURMOIL: DR AKHTAR

The banking system of Pakistan has escaped the major ravaging effects of recent financial
market turmoil emerging from US and engulfing the developed European economies. This
was stated by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar while speaking at
The Asian Banker Dialogue on “The Banks We Like and the Impact of the Global Financial
Crisis on Pakistan’s Banks” at a local hotel in Karachi today.

However, she observed: ‘In my assessment, Pakistan’s economy to date has been affected
mainly by the indirect impact of global events which led to the rise in the global commodity
prices.’ Pakistan is perhaps the worst hit economy by the surge in global commodity prices
as it has been a predominant factor in derailing the macroeconomic fundamentals, she
remarked. Citing an example to explain this situation, she said that almost 80% of the
external current account deficit in FY08 is equivalent to the import oil bill which shot up to
over $11 billion in FY08 as compared to below $3 billion a few years back. Similarly, a
large increase in FY08 fiscal deficit is on account of delay in pass through of the
international price hike at retail level, she observed.

Dr Akhtar said the financial markets in Pakistan have not been hit by the subprime markets
or the associated contagion directly as Pakistan’s banking system from July 2007 to
September 2008 did not face any liquidity problems. With the strong regulatory oversight,
we have seen significant enhancement of capital and capital adequacy ratio supported by
high provisioning requirements. The Governor said that in July 2008, the State Bank of
Pakistan has launched far reaching financial sector reforms to lay foundations for further
enhancing the robustness of the financial system to cope with the emerging challenges.

Elaborating further, she said that the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system is strong
ie. 12.1 percent (in June-08) — well above the internationally acceptable minimum
requirement of 8 percent. Also, core capital constitutes about 80 percent of the total capital
and Tier 1 to risk weighted assets ratio of the banking system is at 9.7 percent — well
exceeding the 4 percent minimum international standard.

As of October 4, 2008, the balance sheet footing of our banking system is around Rs5.1
trillion while loans and deposits of the banking system are around Rs2.8 trillion and Rs3.8
trillion respectively, she added.

In its communications to the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA), the State Bank has advised
the banks to act prudently in sharing the liquidity in the system and ensure that call rates
reflect the fundamentals in the money market, she added. Dr Akhtar said that SBP on its part
has injected regular liquidity in the financial system and since August 2008, conducted

IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey - SBP inks agreement with IBA

The signing Ceremony of Consumer Confidence Survey between State Bank of Pakistan and Institute
of Business Administration (IBA) was held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today. Governor State
Bank Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Director Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Dr Ishrat
Hussain oversaw the signing of the agreement on behalf of their respective organizations.

It may be recalled here that in January 2012, SBP inaugurated the Centre for Survey Research (CSR),
in collaboration with the IBA. This inauguration was followed by the launch in Jan 2014 of a dynamic
web portal [http://dsqx.sbp.org.pk/ccs/index.php] at SBP’s website containing the necessary
information on the survey and the latest data. In this centre the teams from IBA and SBP meet every
other month to collect data on households’ views about various economic propositions.

Shedding light on the importance of the project for SBP and its stakeholders, the Governor stated
that consumer confidence and inflation expectations reflect the confidence of households in the
economy which in turn reflect the state of the economy.”The expectations regarding inflation,
interest rate, stock prices, and employment are important for policy formulation, which explains why
many developed and developing countries are using consumer surveys for policymaking and research
purposes,” he added.

Referring to the flagship Annual, Quarterly Reports and Monetary Policy Statements, the Governor
said “Increased attention to these concept developed therein reflect the maturing of the consumer
confidence project.” The Governor also acknowledged the value addition to the understanding of
inflation in the country by the development of Administered Price Index (API) by the Pakistan Bureau
of Statistics (PBS).

It is worthwhile to mention here that scientific and dependable evidence on the expectations channel
in Pakistan has been rare. Being the Central Bank the SBP enhanced efforts to collect information on
these expectations, in order to undertake meaningful research, which is well-supported by the first-
hand knowledge of the prevailing situation in the country. Important results are available on CCS
web portal in the working paper by Abbas, Beg and Choudhary (2014), ‘Inflation Expectations and
Economic Perceptions in a Developing Country.

The Governor also spoke on the choice of IBA as partner in this project and said that SBP wanted to
partner with a reputable institution to ensure and address any possible Central Bank bias. “I am glad
that we were able to collaborate with a reputable public institution like the IBA in the
accomplishment of this task,” said the Governor adding, “Today we will further solemnize this
partnership.”

Dr. Ishrat Hussain, Director IBA, in his address said that the renewed partnership between SBP and
IBA showed that IBA’s team was able to deliver the project up to the standard required by the Central
Bank. He said that in a country like Pakistan project completion is a novelty because there is general
lack of know-how about successful ‘implementation’ of projects. He said that this project is also a
good example of an educational institution meeting the demands of a policy-making organization,

SBP Launches Videos and Smartphone Application
on Banknote Security Features

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today, as a part of its campaign “Rupay ko Pehchano”, launched Videos
and Smartphone Application on security features of currency notes in a ceremony attended by high-
rank officials of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and presidents and senior executives of
commercial banks. The videos and Smartphone application are aimed at enhancing public awareness
and understanding of the currency notes’ security features thus enabling the public to easily
differentiate between the genuine and fake notes. A total of 5 videos have been developed, one each for
Rs.5000, Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes, one for Rs. 10, 20, 50 and 100 and the fifth highlights the
security features of all the currency notes in circulation. The smart phone application, downloadable
from both Apple and Android platforms, gives information on security features of currency notes both

in descriptive and pictorial forms.

The Governor SBP, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, while launching the videos and Smartphone
application said that SBP has adopted a three pronged strategy to combat counterfeiting which
involves: i) enhancing the security features of our currency notes to make counterfeiting even more
difficult; ii) automation of cash processing function in the banking system to ensure that no fake note
passes through the banking system; and, iii) creating awareness amongst general public about security

features of the currency notes to help them differentiate between genuine and fake notes.

He said that under the strategy some advanced security features are being added in the higher
denomination currency notes of Rs.500 and above and that the higher denomination notes with
enhanced security features, after approval by the Federal Government, would be available for issuance
by third quarter of Calendar Year 16. Further, in order to ensure that no counterfeit currency passes
through the banking system; a comprehensive cash management strategy has been issued to automate
banks’ cash processing functions by January 2017. SBP itself is in the process of installing state-of-the-
art high-speed banknote processing machines at SBP BSC Karachi and other important regions across

the country, he added.

Emphasizing the importance of the videos and Smartphone application the Governor said that the key

deterrent against currency counterfeiting is the public awareness about the security features of currency

Pakistan’s Banking Sector is resilient: Dr Akhtar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has said that Pakistan’s banking
sector is quite resilient and has been and will be able to withstand different types of market
shocks and adverse macro economic conditions. This capability has been achieved through
continuous financial reform process distinctively pursued during the past few years. There
should not be any cause for concern about the stability of the banking system in the coming
days, she added.

In a press statement issued today, she pointed out that the banking system shows strong
performance and holds a promising outlook, the investors maintained their confidence in the
banking system and injected additional capital of around $500 million since 2006 that coupled
with retained earnings improved the capital base of the banks.

Dr Akhtar said that the banking sector has strong capital adequacy well above the minimum
requirement. The capital adequacy ratio of the system is 12.1% as of June 08 that is well above
the international benchmark. The nonperforming loans ratio and the ratio of non-performing
loans to capital are also quite low and within acceptable ranges. “The infection ratio (net) in June
2008 has improved to 1.1% from 1.6 % in Dec-2006, signifying that the banks set aside more reserves
out of their earnings to cover the increase in non-performing loans. Accordingly, the NPL coverage and
capital impairment ratios have also improved,” the SBP Governor added.

SBP Governor said that Pakistani banks largely focus on conventional lending and are not
exposed to subprime credit instruments in the international market. The lending and
investments of the banks are subject to the stringent prudential regulations of SBP that prohibit
the banks from clean lending and investment in low quality assets. Further, the banks are
required to recognize the loan losses and provide for these losses in line with the established
best practices. State Bank of Pakistan through its on-site inspection and off-site supervision
wings keeps a close watch on the state of each bank as well as the banking system in entirety
for any risk to the stability of the banking system.

In 2007, SBP made loan provisioning requirements more stringent in order to create adequate
cushions to withstand any potential credit adversity. Stress testing analysis of the system
suggests that the system is capable to withstand variety of plausible shocks in major risk factors
without losing its solvency, Dr Akhtar added.

She said that Pakistan’s banking system has been showing steady growth, satisfactory operating
performance, strong resilience towards major risk factors, and efficiency; reflecting upon the
strong fundamentals that the system has developed during financial sector’s reform process.

Governor SBP emphasizes ongoing dialogue between the business community and policy
makers during his visit of Sialkot Chamber of Commerce & Industry

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, paid a visit today to the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (SCCI) on the invitation of its President, Mr. Qaisar Iqbal Baryal. The purpose of his visit was
to seek firsthand knowledge from the businesses community, particularly the exporters, on the economic
challenges faced by them in the face of global slowdown amid covid-19 pandemic. At the outset of his
visit, the Governor thanked the President of SCCI saying that an ongoing dialogue between the policy
makers and business community on the economic measures and their effectiveness is key to combat the
prevalent domestic as well as global economic challenges. In this regard, the Governor acknowledged the
proactive role played by SCCI in raising awareness about the issues and their potential solutions with the
policy makers. Deputy Governor, Ms. Sima Kamil, MD SBP BSC, Mr. Muhammed Ashraf Khan and other
members of the senior management were also accompanying the Governor during this visit.

Dr. Baqir’s address on the occasion encompassed many topics and answered most of the questions
prevalent amongst the business community prior to his visit. He said that the effects of COVID-19 had
taken a heavy toll on economies all over the world and Pakistan was no exception. While elaborating the
proactive steps taken by SBP since the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, as early as March 2020, the Governor
elaborated that the overall objective of these measures was to minimize the negative fallout of the
slowdown in the economy on businesses and employment in the country. Overall, the SBP measures
aimed at ensuring increased and affordable financing to the businesses to help them manage their cash
flows and financial costs effectively. In this regard, SBP reduced policy rate from 13.25 percent to 7
percent in a very short span of time that is historically unprecedented, he said.

Shedding more light on the measures to keep the wheel of economy rolling, the Governor elaborated
some other key steps taken by SBP in addition to reducing interest rates. The Governor shared the details
of Deferment of Principle Amount and Restructuring of Loans Package to facilitate the borrowers in a bid
to preserve the solvency of the borrowers and enable them to combat temporary economic disruptions.
Under this scheme, over 1.5 million borrowers benefitted with over Rs655 billion loans deferred and about
Rs200 billion restructured. Another major step by SBP to offset the sudden impact of economic shock
was to prevent layoff of workers. SBP introduced its Rozgar Scheme that aimed at preventing layoff of
workers by financing wages and salaries of all kinds of employees for private sector businesses. During
the availability of this scheme, almost 3,000 businesses availed refinancing of over Rs237 billion
benefitting over 1.6 million employees or workers.

The Governor contended that in the backdrop of COVID-19, SBP provided a number of relaxations under
Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and Long Term Finance Facility (LTFF). These included additional period of

SBP Issues Draft Framework on IT Governance & Risk Management for Financial
Institutions

 

State Bank of Pakistan has issued draft Framework on IT Governance & Risk Management for
Financial Institutions for comments/feedback from interested parties. The draft framework is
available on SBP’s website www.sbp.org.pk.

The framework is based on international standards and recognized principles of international
practice for technology governance and risk management and shall serve as SBP's baseline
requirement for all Financial Institutions (Fls). It aims to provide enabling regulatory environment
for managing risks associated with use of technology.

The framework will apply to all Fls which includes commercial banks (public and private sector
banks), Islamic banks, Development Finance Institutions (DFls), and Microfinance Banks
(MFBs). The framework is not ""one-size-fits-all"" and implementation of the same shall be risk-
based and commensurate with size, nature and types of products and services and complexity
of IT operations of the individual Fls.

The instructions are focused on enhancing the proactive and reactive environments in Fls to
various facets and dimensions of the information technology, security, operations, audit and
related domains and to create overall safe and secure technology operations in Fls which will
benefit and enhance the confidence of all the stakeholders. The Fis are expected to assess and
conduct a gap analysis between their current status and the guidelines and draw a time-bound
action plan to address the gaps and comply with the guidelines.

SBP invites the interested parties, institutions or individuals, from banking sector, IT industry,
academia and other stakeholders to review the proposed draft framework and provide
comments/feedback, if any, at the following email address: EITGF@sbp.org.pk

The draft framework is open for comments/feedback from interested parties till March 31, 2017

PRIMARY DEALER SYSTEM RULES REVISED TO ATTRACT MORE
PARTICIPATION BY EMPLOYEES PENSION AND RETIREMENT FUNDS

The State Bank of Pakistan today revised the rules governing the Primary Dealer
System in order to bring about more flexibility, higher competitiveness and transparency
into the auctioning of Government Securities.

Under the revised rules, non-competitive bidders (NCBs), who are primarily
employees pension, provident, retirement funds, and other corporates will now be
allowed to bid to a maximum of Rs. 25 million or 0.25% in the Government Securities
auction target, whichever is higher. This is a significant relaxation over the previous fixed
ceiling of Rs. 10 million, which was not linked to auction target. This relaxation is
expected to result in higher participation of NCBs and benefit the employees and pension
funds and trusts, who have an appetite for longer term Government Securities.

The revised rules will raise the level of competitiveness by the introduction of
minimum targets to be met by each Primary Dealer as under:-

1. Meet 5% of the NCB auction target for the year.

2. Underwrite a minimum 3.5% of Pakistan Investment Bond (PIB) auction target.

3. Achieve 5% of overall secondary market turnover in both Market Treasury Bills
(MTBs) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) during the year.

4. Attain at least 1% of short-selling against “when issued” PIB traded annually.

In future PIB auctions, short selling against “when issued” trading will only be
entertained when an auction is accepted. Primary dealers will also be allowed to short sell
upto a period of 14 days in case of MTBs and 3 months in case of PIBs.

Brokerage Houses will be able to witness the auction proceedings of Government
Securities in future.

The changes in the Primary Dealers rules are expected to generate much needed
interest in PIBs by the pensioners/retirees. This will allow them to create a consistent
stream of income from risk free securities and adequately match their future liabilities
calculated on an actuarial basis or otherwise.

It may be recalled that the State Bank of Pakistan introduced the rules governing the
primary dealer system in June 2000, which were subsequently revised to bring these in
line with the international market practices and a new set of rules was introduced in July
2003. Based on the feedback from the Primary Dealers, these rules have now been further

revised.

State Bank enhances scope and financing limits under its Rozgar Scheme

Since its launch of Refinance Scheme to Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers, called
Rozgar Scheme in common parlance, State Bank has been constantly receiving feedback from various
stakeholders, making the scheme more facilitative for businesses and creating incentives to prevent
layoff of employees under current COVID Pandemic scenario. Many of the changes in the scheme were
carried out to ensure that the benefits of the scheme particularly reaches to the SMEs that offer
employment to a large number of people. In this regard, recently announced Government's risk sharing
facility and allowing corporate guarantees as collateral are expected to incentivize banks in extending
loans to collateral deficient SMEs. Now taking another step further to facilitate middle and large
businesses, which employ large numbers of people, to ensure payment of wages and salaries under
this scheme, SBP has decided to enhance its refinance limits announced earlier.

Hence, State Bank will now finance up to 100% of wages and salaries of businesses with average 3-
month wage bill of up to Rs500 million (see table below). This can be used for the onward payment of
wages and salaries for the months of April, May and June, 2020. Earlier, 100% financing was available
up to a wage bill of Rs200 million only. Similarly, for businesses with 3-month wage bill exceeding
Rs500 million, State Bank will now finance of up to 75% with maximum financing of Rs1 billion. Earlier,
75% financing was available up to a maximum of Rs375 million and 50% up to a maximum of Rs500
million. The above changes are applicable with immediate effect. However, businesses that had earlier
availed lower financing due to applicable limits can now avail additional financing on the basis of
revised criteria. Further details on this measure are available in the SBP circular available at:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL10.htm

A comparison of previous and new financing limits is given in the following table:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Category | Wages and Salaries Bill for Previous Loan Limit New Loan Limits
3 months
(1) (2) (3) (4)
A Less than or equal to Rs. | 100% of 3 months wage bill | 100% of 3 months
200 million wage bill
B More than Rs. 200 million | Rs. 200 million or 75% of 3 | 100% of 3 months
and less than or equal to | months wage bill, whichever | wage bill
Rs.500 million is higher subject to a
maximum cap of Rs 375
million
Cc More than Rs.500 million Rs. 375 million or 50% of 3 | Rs.500 million or 75%
months wage bill, whichever | of 3 months wage bill,
is higher subject to maximum | whichever is higher
cap of Rs. 500 million subject to maximum
cap of Rs. 1 billion

 

 

 

 

 

This increase in financing limits along with Government's risk sharing facility for collateral deficient
SMEs and small corporates will enable the full array of businesses to benefit from SBP’s Rozgar Scheme

Press Release
No question of refusing details of written off loans arises

Apropos debate on written off loans that arises intermittently in print and electronic media,
certain facts need to be put on record that will enhance quality of such debates thus enabling

viewers/readers to analyze things in true perspective.

State Bank has never refused to furnish information about written off loans of banks to the
parliament. In fact, this information is always available publicly as it is mandatory for banks to
disclose, as a part of their financial statements, the names of persons and amounts written off

of Rs.500,000/- and above every year.

The recent demand of information by the Senate (upper house of the parliament) was about the
names of borrowers of Rs. 5 million or more who obtained loans from a bank during the last

five years along with the number of cases recovered and waived off.

SBP clearly responded that none of the loan was waived off by the concerned bank out of the
loans of Rs. 5 million or more disbursed during the aforesaid period. Further, information
about number of loans disbursed by the bank during the last five years and recovery of loans

was also furnished to Senate in consolidated form.

However, the names of individual borrowers of that bank, who availed loans during last five
years and no write off involved in these cases, were not shared due to legal provisions of
Section 33-A of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 and Section 9 of Protection of

Economic Reforms Act 1992 which bar sharing of customers’ individual information.

Section 33-A of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, titled as Fidelity and secrecy,
stipulates that—(1) Subject to sub-section (4), every bank and financial institution shall,
except as otherwise required by law, observe the practices and usage customary among
bankers and, in particular, shall not divulge any information relating to the affairs of its
customers except in circumstances in which it is, in accordance with law, practice and usage

customary among bankers, necessary or appropriate for a bank to divulge such information.

Press Release on Workers’ Remittances

 

Workers’ remittances maintained their strong momentum in November, remaining above
USS 2 billion for a record 6th consecutive month.

Workers’ remittances rose to $ 2.34 billion in November, 2.4 percent higher than in October
and 28.4 percent higher than last November.

During the first five months of FY21, workers’ remittances have reached an unprecedented
level of USS 11.77 billion, 26.9 percent higher than the same period last year. On average,
workers’ remittances have been about half a billion (USS 499 million) higher in each month of
FY21 as compared to the same period last year.

Remittance inflows during the first five months of FY21 have mainly been sourced from Saudi
Arabia (S 3.3 billion), United Arab Emirates ($ 2.4 billion), United Kingdom ($ 1.6 billion) and
United States ($ 1.0 billion).

Continued government and SBP efforts to formalize remittances under the Pakistan
Remittances Initiative (PRI), rising use of digital channels amid limited cross-border travel,
orderly exchange market conditions, and some improvement in global economic activity are
some of the important factors behind the sustained improvement in workers’ remittances.

State Bank’s Fresh Currency Notes Service 8877 Receives
Overwhelming Public Response

In order to meet the public demand for fresh currency notes on the occasion of Eid ul Fitr 2017, the
State Bank of Pakistan Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) re-launched the SMS Short Code based
service (8877) for issuance of fresh currency notes on the occasion of this Ramzan as well from June
12, 2017.

The service has been made available through a network of 1002 e-branches of banks in 120 cities and
16 field offices of SBP BSC across Pakistan. This service has once again attracted overwhelming
response of the general public. SBP is pleased to inform the general public that so far around 1.6
million individuals have obtained booking code out of which around 40% have received fresh cash
from the above branches against surrender of exchange value. Given the capacity of the bank
branches to handle customers, we expect that the service will reach its maximum limit of bookings in
few days and further bookings will be not possible thereafter.

The general public is apprised that the booking service will be closed after reaching its maximum
limit, expected by end of June 20, 2017 and as such no booking code will be issued thereafter.
However the member of general public who would have obtained booking code for issuance of fresh
cash shall be eligible to draw the same up to close of business on Friday the 23 June 2017 subject to
validity of the booking code.

It would be pertinent to mention that apart from this SMS service banks may continue to provide
fresh notes to their customers from their branches and ATMs as sufficient quantity is being provided
to them by State Bank.

These are (i)prospective sponsors desirous of setting up renewable energy power projects with
capacity ranging between 1 — 50 MW and (ii) consumers willing to install facility using renewable
energy source for generation of electricity ranging between 4 KW — 1 MW for own use and/or for

SBP Deputy Governor, Mr. Kamran Shehzad stresses
upon banks to improve their service standards

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed
upon banks to focus on improving their service standards and serve the people and their
customers in an efficient and professional manner. ‘The banking is actually peoples’ confidence
and it is necessary for ensuring soundness of our banks and banking system,’ he added.

Inaugurating a new corporate branch of Bank of Khyber (BoK) in Karachi today, he said
that over the last few years, the State Bank has brought about major changes in its Branch
Licensing Policy to allow menu of options to banks for expanding their outreach to all nooks and
corners of the country; the incentive build in the policy aimed at expanding financial services to
unbanked and rural areas.

‘The policy allows opening of branches for conventional banking services as well as
segments specific branches like microfinance services, Islamic banking branches and smaller
limited service banking set ups like sub-branches and permanent booths,’ he said, adding that
banking rules and regulations have been so designed in order to provide an even playing field to
all banks.

SBP Deputy Governor said that the branchless banking is the new avenue for expanding
financial outreach in a more cost effective and efficient manner. Keeping in view its importance,
the State Bank had introduced Branchless Banking Regulations in 2008, he said, adding that as a
result, Branchless Banking is expanding steadily with the increasing participation of stronger as
well as new players.

‘Lam quite positive that this new vista will not only bring about efficiency but also
accelerate the provisions of financial services to a large population which is currently not able
to tap the modern day banking facilities,’ he said, adding that all these efforts are aimed at
facilitating banking sector to provide better services to their customers, convenience to general
public and ultimately contributing in the economic development and growth of Pakistan.

Mr. Kamran Shehzad said the Bank of Khyber is continuing its journey of healthy growth
in assets during the last few years. ‘It is actually one of the few middle tier banks which have
improved their performance despite tough operating conditions. The Bank is also playing its
due role in promotion of Islamic Banking through Islamic branch network of twenty-six
branches (out of total seventy-eight business places)’, he added.

Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra accompanied by Mr. Faisal
Edhi and Mr. Jimmy Engineer inaugurated exhibition of pencil sketches of Abdul Sattar Edhi
by Jimmy Engineer at State Bank Museum & Art Gallery in Karachi today.

Jimmy Engineer through his pencil sketches of Abdul Sattar Edhi gifted to State Bank
Museum & Art Gallery has portrayed the pain and sympathy Abdul Sattar Edhi felt for the
needy people. These sketches also reflected love and dedication of Mr. Edhi to the
downtrodden of the society. The sketches portray the hardships Mr. Edhi faced to carry out
his mission of humanitarianism. Speaking on the occasion, Governor State Bank
acknowledged the services of great philanthropist, and human right activist Adbul Sattar
Edhi. The Governor also lauded dedication of Mr. Jimmy Engineer for making sketches of the
great philanthropist.

The Governor in his address announced that commemorative coin of Rs50 in memory of
Abdul Sattar Edhi will be issued in March 2017 as a small token of appreciation for his selfless
services for the country. It may be recalled here that the work on design of Rs. 50
commemorative coin in memory of late Abdul Sattar Edhi was already in progress after Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif had accorded its approval in the cabinet meeting held on July 15,
2016.Addressing the ceremony the Governor also requested CEOs of banks to dedicate some
of their CSR activities to promote art and heritage in the country.

Mr. Jimmy Engineer speaking on the occasion said he received great inspiration from the
services of Mr. Edhi rendered to the mankind. He said Edhi is a legend for the whole world.
He said he had been drawing sketches of late Mr. Edhi as no person in any other country
could equal splendid services rendered by late Edhi. “Whenever | visited foreign countries
people talked about Pakistan negatively but when | asked them do you have any person like
Abdul Sattar Edhi they had no answer,” he claimed. Jimmy thanked Governor, State Bank for
placing these sketches at SBP Museum & Art Gallery.

Mr. Faisal Edhi also spoke on the occasion and thanked on behalf of family of Edhi Sahab and
Edhi Foundation for holding the ceremony in the memory of Abdul Sattar Edhi. He felt
satisfaction that services of late Edhi will be remembered through art work of Jimmy
Engineer.

After the inaugural ceremony, Governor, SBP performed ribbon cutting of the exhibition and
visited the exhibition site in SBP’s Museum and Art Gallery with Mr. Faisal Edhi, Jimmy
Engineer and other dignitaries and guests.

Com m ercialbanks extend Rs 138 45 bin to exporters
under the m odified Export Finance Scheme

 

The export refinance facilities extended by commercial banks to the
exporters at 7.5% (including those granted by them from their own sources)
stood at Rs 138.45 billion as per the latest data available upto 15%
December, 2007 as against RS 126.85 billion extended during the
corresponding period of the Jast fiscalyear show ing a grow th of 9.15% .

The m odification made in the system of grant of refinance to banks
under the Export Finance Scheme has resulted in enhancement of
availability of working capital facilities to the exporters; especially exporters
of value-added textik sector, at 7.5% p.a.Reports regarding the reduction in
the availability of working capital facilities to the exporters are incorrect,
baseless and m iskeading.

It may be mentioned here that the banks have provided significant
financing through their own sources since the start of the m odified
procedure viz. about Rs 38 billion ata rate of 7.5% p.a. and the State Bank
has funded rest. Sector-wise analysis of data revealed that banks have
provided about Rs 83.4 billion to the textile sector during the quarter that
ended in September 2007 as compared to Rs 71.5 billion during the
corresponding period of the Jast fiscal year show ing an increase of about
17% . Export refinance has grown ata faster rate than the export earnings.
Textil exports are continuously declining from the month of July, 2007
when textike exports were $952 m illion which declined to $938 m illion, $922
million & $837 millon during the months of August, Septem ber and
October 2007, respecte].

It may be pointed out here that as on 30 June 2007, a totalofRs
134 billion was outstanding as refinance granted by the State Bank to
different banks under its Export Finance Schem e. H owever, due to m onetary
policy im plications of the refinance granted under EFS & LTF-EOP Scheme
especialy the debt swap under the modified Scheme, the State Bank
introduced a mechanism whereby commercial banks were directed to
provide 30% ofexport finance from their own sources ata rate of 7.50% pa.
This step was accom panied by instructions to banks to ensure adequate
availability of export finance. SBP has held several consultations with
exporters and their associations and comm ercialbanks as wellas held pint
meetings for them to better understand the m echanism of facility.

15,000 & Rs. 25,000 per day respectively.

Bills payments & mobile top-ups remained the dominating activity during July-September
2012 quarter with 45 percent share in total numbers, followed by person to person (over the
counter) fund transfers with a share of 38 percent. Bulk payments mostly by agents topped,
among others, by 41 percent share in total value transacted during the quarter followed by
person to person fund transfers with a share of 34 percent.

It may be pointed out that the BB service providers are trying to increase their linkages
with microfinance institutions as loan repayments of Rs.646 million were collected through
Branchless Banking agents during the quarter.

According to the Newsletter, the growth expectation in coming quarters is fairly high as
the existing two Branchless Banking players are increasing their scale of operations and two
banks namely Waseela Microfinance Bank and Askari Bank Limited have launched their
branchless banking services under the brand names of ‘Mobicash’ and ‘Timepey’ respectively.

The Branchless Banking Newsletter, which covers a detailed BB growth analysis and
important BB events/initiatives, is available at the following link of SBP website:

Banks asked to submit compliance report of every

order of Banking Mohtasib/SBP Governor

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has advised all banks/ DFls to submit a compliance
report of every order of Banking Mohtasib of Pakistan (BMP) and the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan along with documentary evidence, within one week of its compliance to the Head,
Consumer Protection Department, SBP through their duly authorized officers at or above the
rank of Executive Vice President/Group Head.

It may be pointed out that in terms of Section 82 E (5) of the Banking Companies
Ordinance 1962 (BCO), banks are required to comply with the decision of Banking Mohtasib of
Pakistan (BMP) within forty days of the date of Order. However, if an Appeal against the
decision of the Banking Mohtasib is referred to the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, the
aforesaid period of forty days reckons from the date of decision of Appeal.

Instances have been noted where banks have not adhered to the aforementioned
provisions of BCO and have complied with the Orders of BMP and the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan with a significant delay, says CPD Circular No. 1 of February 28, 2012.

The State Bank has taken serious notice of such non-compliance and it has been decided
that such a violation of Section 82 E (5) of BCO 1962, shall be subject to penal action, it added.

State Bank releases 3rd Quarterly Report
Economy showed revival after many years of low growth: SBP

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Third Quarterly Report for FY14 on the State of Economy, today.
According to the report, Pakistan’s economy appears to have turned a corner during the third quarter.
Revival of economic activity is a key development in FY14, with real GDP growth of 4.1 percent, which
is the highest in the past five years.

The report says that after many years of low growth, sentiments about the economy seem to have
improved. Manifestations can be seen in the rebound in real GDP growth; the rise in private sector credit;
a contained fiscal deficit; the subdued inflation outlook; the sharp increase in FX reserves; and the
appreciation and subsequent stability in the exchange rate.

The report mentioned that improvements in the economy were the result of the government’s resolve to
address the energy shortage, a growing perception of business friendly policies, and external inflows that
have recently been realized. More specifically, auction of 3G/4G licenses; a larger than projected inflow
via Eurobonds; program loans from the IFIs; and SBP’s efforts to support the FX reserves, have sharply
improved the outlook of the country’s external sector, and to some extent, its fiscal position.

However, the Report emphasized that “these signs of improvements should not discount the challenges
faced by the economy; and efforts for much needed structural reforms should continue. These positives
developments provide a strong platform to move towards sustained economic growth in the medium
term.”

According to the Report, the recent influx of external resources not only stabilized the exchange rate, but
also sharply increased SBP’s FX reserves. “As of 30"" May 2014, SBP’s reserves were USS 8.7 billion,
compared to only US$ 3.5 billion as of end-December 2013. While the PKR’s appreciation improved
business sentiments and its subsequent stability has eased inflationary expectation, the sharp increase in
the country’s FX reserves provides some comfort for domestic and foreign investment.”’

The report says that average inflation during Jul-Mar FY14 was 8.6 percent. Going forward, the stability
of PKR, stable international oil prices, and softer global commodity prices should further contain
inflationary expectations.

On the basis of data released by the Ministry of Finance, the SBP Report says that fiscal deficit during the
first nine months of FY14 was only 3.2 percent of GDP, which is significantly lower than the average
deficit in the last five years. The Report, however, points out that despite efforts for fiscal consolidation
on the expenditure side, tax mobilization still remains lackluster, as FBR is still operating on a narrow tax
base. While the FBR should take concrete steps to plug tax leakages and increase documentation of all
financial transactions, provincial governments (having constitutional right to tax services and agricultural
income) also need to implement provincial taxes more effectively.

On the financing side, the Government mainly relied on domestic sources during Jul-Mar FY14.
However, external financing has increased subsequently with the issuance of Eurobonds, fresh loans from

REPORTING OF WRITTEN OFF/WAIVED OFF LOANS AND
ADVANCES OF CORPORATE BORROWERS TO eCIB

 

 

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to reduce the reflection period of written off/waived loans
and advances for corporate borrowers in the Electronic Credit Information Bureau (eCIB) of SBP from
15 years to 10 years. eCIBis a repository of information about the credit history of borrowers of the
banking system and is largely used by banks/Financial Institutions to assess the creditworthiness of
borrowers. This decision follows a detailed assessment of international practices.

Ithas beenageneral impression that reflectingthe negative history/ write-off foralonger period might
deprive the borrowers of a fresh start and would exclude borrowers from access to finance for longer
periods (following the write-offs/waivers) regardless of the borrowers’ current financial performance
and other favorable information. It may be noted that various business bodies and Chamber Members
frequently also raisedsuch concerns. They were of the viewthat placing a one-time write-off/waiver in
eCIB for 15 years is a long period particularly when a business has paid back or settled its transaction
with the bank. It creates difficulties for businesses in availing fresh financing for along time.

Decreasing the reflection periodto 10 years will bring our system in line with the international practice
and provide aconducive business environment to boost economic activities besides helping to improve
the country ranking in the Ease of Doing Survey conducted by the World Bank periodically.

Credit Information Bureau/Creditregistry (eCIB) isone of the supervisory tools used worldwide to assist
the supervisors in off-site supervision and on-site examinations. SBP established its Credit Registry i.e.
eCIBin 1992 with the objective to complement its role of prudential supervision and assessmentof the
risk monitoring functions of its regulated Fls. Since then, the eCIB of SBP has evolved from manual to
modern electronic online credit reporting system fueled by improvements in system and technology.
The existing eCIB system is not only helping in the expansion of credit but also enabling Fls to move
from the traditional subjective approach of granting credit toa more efficient lending process.

SBP’s facilitates businesses availing financing under Rozgar Scheme to
disburse salaries before Eid-ul-Azha

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed disbursement of wages/ salaries for the month of July to be
made before Eid-ul-Azha under its Rozgar Scheme. Earlier the banks were required to disburse salaries
according to the cycle of salaries used by businesses, which is typically after the completion of the
month. Now the businesses may avail financing to pay wages and salaries for the month of July or get

reimbursement after paying wages.

Further, SBP has also provided flexibility to the businesses by allowing them to avail financing from
more than one bank. Businesses were facing difficulty in availing financing from one bank due to their
credit limits or other reasons. However, businesses cannot avail financing for a specific month from

more than one bank. For details: http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL24.htm

The Rozgar Scheme that provides concessional financing to businesses was introduced in April 2020 to
avoid lay off of employees and prevent unemployment. Initially it was available for three months, April-
June 2020, but was subsequently extended for another three months till end September 2020. Under
the Scheme, up till 17th July 2020, financing of Rs 128.6 billion has been approved by banks for 2,141

businesses covering wages and salaries of over 1.25 million employees.

Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector- December 2015

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 31* December,
2015 released by SBP today highlighted that the asset base of the banking sector has registered an
increase of 4.6 percent.

A healthy growth of 7.8 percent in private sector advances (both seasonal and for fixed investment)
and moderate rise in banks’ investment in sovereign papers were the major contributors to this
increase in assets. The reviewed quarter was also marked by a QoQ 6.9 percent growth (YoY 12.6
percent) in deposit base of the banking sector, primarily, driven by growth in current account and
fixed deposits.

The asset quality of the banking sector improved largely at the back of improved cash recoveries. The
QPR reported that NPLs to loans ratio decreased from 12.5 percent in September-15 to 11.4 percent
in December, 2015, while Net NPLs to Net loans decreased from 2.5 percent to 1.9 percent. This
improvement in asset quality indicators advocates continuous decline in risk to the future operating
performance and equity of the banking sector.

The profit after tax of the banking sector for Calendar Year (CY) 2015 reached to PKR 199 billion;
around 22 percent up from PKR 163 billion recorded during CY14. Accordingly, Return on Assets
(ROA) before tax increased to 2.5 percent in December-15 quarter from 2.2 percent in December-14
quarter. As reported, the profitability of the banking sector was broad based encompassing large
spectrum of banks.

The rise in financing flows to private sector has improved the utilization of idle capital as reflected
through slight reduction in Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) to 17.3 percent, which is ; still well above the
minimum local required threshold of 10.25 percent and international benchmark of 8.625 percent.
Moreover, the solvency profile of the banking system remained strong due to healthy profitability
and equity injections by few MCR non-compliant banks.

SBP takes media on-board over its meeting with CEOs of commercial banks

State Bank of Pakistan, for the first time, took electronic and print media on-board after
Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra addressed CEOs of
commercial banks at SBP headquarters I.| Chundrigar Road, Karachi.

Thanking media representatives for arriving on short notice, Governor SBP said this is the
first time that we have invited media as a follow on to such a meeting with the presidents
and CEOs of banks. “The reason being there have been so many rumors for the last few days
regarding one important measure taken by the State Bank over unnecessary foreign travel of
the banks’ staff, “said the Governor adding, “Somehow this was linked to one particular bank
causing panic like situation over the weekend. Governor SBP said SBP wished to clear the air
with these rumors by sharing our conversation with the media.

The Governor went on to add that today’s meeting, however, was not limited to this issue
only but was called to discuss many important issues faced by the economy in general and
the financial sector, in particular.

Following are the main issues discussed during the meeting.

Trade Based Money Laundering: It is well known fact that trade transactions have the
elements of under invoicing and over invoicing which facilitates transfer of value across
the borders. Primary responsibility in this regard lies with Pakistan Customs, however,
since documents are negotiated and L/Cs are settled through formal banking sector,
banks are required to enhance their capacity to process foreign trade transactions with
extreme care and diligence.

Banking services to unlicensed forex operators: Illegal forex operators may have
accounts with banks through which they may be conducting illegal remittance business.
Banks are required to enhance their customer due diligence processes so that such
relationships could be avoided. In this regards, banks should monitor the transaction
patterns of their customers and report suspicious activities to FMU.

To minimize money laundering through banking channels, banks should take the

following measures:

e Implement an in-house system to detect differences between the values declared
in the documents and prevailing market prices. In addition, banks need to set out
escalation procedures to manage transactions where significant differences in
prices are identified.

e Perform additional due diligence when international trade transactions involve
any related parties. The banks must put in place subjective and objective controls
to identify related parties trade transactions. In such cases if there are deviations
then these should be brought to SBPs attention and/or STRs may be raised.

Financial Stability Review CY-19 suggests resilience of the
banking sector to the COVID-19 pandemic

 

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued its flagship annual publication, the Financial Stability Review
(FSR) for CY19. The Review presents performance and risk assessment of various segments of the
financial sector including banks, non-banking financial institutions, financial markets, non-financial
corporates and financial market infrastructures.

The FSR notes that the outbreak of COVID-19, the trigger for the Global Health Crisis (GHC), has had
significant consequences for the global and domestic economy. As elsewhere, the dismal impact of
COVID-19 on Pakistan is still unfolding. The country, after imposing lockdowns, has moved towards
easing some of the restrictions, amid rising levels of infection. This should help provide support to
economic activity.

In order to limit risks and facilitate stakeholders, SBP has taken a host of policy measures. These
measures include substantial monetary easing, release of capital buffers, deferment of the repayment
of principal loan amount for corporate, SMEs, and household borrowers, restructuring/rescheduling of
loans, concessionary financing to save jobs and boost health care to combat COVID-19, ensuring
availability and continuity of financial services, and reduction in payment system related costs. These
measures have started bearing results as banks have approved debt deferment of around PKR 495
billion and rescheduling/restructuring of PKR 70 billion to around seven hundred thousand borrowers.
Under the refinance scheme to avoid layoffs, around PKR 93 billion have been approved for 1172
companies covering about eight hundred and fifty thousand employees. A complete list of the
measures taken so far and the outcomes are available on  SBP’s_ website
(http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp).

Going forward, the pace and extent of global and domestic economic revival are inextricably tied to the
trajectory of Covid-19. Against this backdrop, SBP is keeping a close watch on developments and stands
ready to take all policy actions in its domain to safeguard the economic and financial stability.

Overall, it is encouraging that the strong capital buffers built over the years have significantly enhanced
the resilience of Pakistan’s banking sector. Stress tests conducted in the FSR suggests that the banking
sector should remain resilient to the Covid-19 shock under most reasonable shock scenarios, reflecting
the strong capital and liquidity positions of the majority of banks as discussed below.

In terms of performance last year, the FSR suggests that after some strains due to sluggish growth
during the early part of the year, financial sector stability started to improve towards the end of CY19.
Owing to necessary stabilization measures, macroeconomic vulnerabilities emanating from Pakistan’s
external and fiscal imbalances along with the uncertainty prevailing amongst market participants began
to recede by year-end. There were early signs of an economic revival as foreign exchange reserves
increased, the market-based exchange rate stabilized, the fiscal deficit contracted, and economic
activity, particularly the Large Scale Manufacturing, revived. Due to better sentiment, both local and
foreign investors started taking positions in the equity and bond markets of the country. As
macroeconomic stress declined, the stability of the financial sector improved.

The consolidated asset base of the financial sector expanded by 11.74 percent during CY19; higher than
the 7.46 percent growth recorded in the previous year. The major contribution in this growth came
from the banking sector, the largest segment of the financial sector. Financial markets—after remaining

Treasury Single Account

Some news are circulating on social media regarding government plans to introduce Treasury Single
Account (TSA). While the proposal to introduce TSA is being examined by the Government of Pakistan
in consultation with SBP as part of its agenda to reform public financial management, however, no
decision has yet been made to implement the TSA. Any decision in this regard will be taken after due
consultation with all the stakeholders and assessing its impact on the banking industry. It will,
therefore, be premature to form any opinion about the proposed policy decision and thus the market

players should avoid engaging in any speculative activities based on this proposal which is still under
examination.

Converting of existing (ATM) card portfolios to EMV chip and PIN

SBP categorically rejects baseless rumors making the rounds in a section of press that the existing
ATM cards with magnetic stripe have stopped working since December 31, 2019. SBP has not issued
any such instruction to card issuers (Banks/MFBs). Customers who have still not received their
Europay Mastercard Visa (EMV-Chip and PIN) cards can continue using their existing magnetic stripe
cards till the time they have received and activated their new cards. However, based on activation
and delivery trends, the card issuers may block existing magnetic stripe cards to ensure complete
migration to EMV (Chip and PIN) at a future date.

We would like to recall that SBP vide PSD Circular Letter No. 09 of 2018 had advised all Banks/MFBs
to re-card their existing card portfolios to EMV chip and PIN by June 30, 2019. However, upon the
request of the industry the timeline was revised to December 31, 2019 vide PSD Circular Letter No. 01
of 2019.

SBP has also allowed numerous Banks/MEBs to utilize Alternate Delivery Channels (ADCs) other than
call centers like Mobile Banking, Internet Banking and ATMs etc. for payment card activation
purposes. The move is aimed at easing the pressure on the call centers (which are used by customers
for activation of their cards) and to facilitate customers of Banks/MFBs.

SBP reiterates that it will continue making all out efforts to ensure timely and seamless migration of
customers from magnetic stripe to the more secure EMV (Chip and PIN) standard.

Deposit Protection Corporation becomes a member of International Association of Deposit Insurers

The Secretariat of International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) announced on February 11, 2019
that its Executive Council has decided to admit Deposit Protection Corporation (DPC), State Bank of
Pakistan as [ADI Member. DPC is 84"" member of the global body of deposit insurers whose objective is
to contribute to the enhancement of deposit insurance effectiveness and safety by promoting guidance
and international cooperation.

Established in 2002, IADI is a non-profit organization under the auspices of Bank for International
Settlements (BIS). IADI is a forum for deposit insurers from around the world to gather and share
knowledge and expertise. It provides training and educational programs and produces research and
guidance on matters related to deposit insurance (also known as deposit protection). IADI actively
collaborates with international organizations that contribute to financial stability. The cooperation with
these organizations helps to strengthen deposit insurance system.

As a membership of IADI, DPC would benefit through institutional capacity building and greater
interaction with international deposit insurers to learn from their experiences. This will also
complement the strategic goal of “strengthening the financial system stability regime” — one of the
objectives of State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Strategic Plan 2016-20.

DPC has been established as a wholly owned subsidiary of SBP (under the Deposit Protection
Corporation Act, 2016), with the objective of compensating the small and financially unsophisticated
depositors to the extent of protected deposits.

State Bank conducts awareness campaign on SME finance
in Sialkot, Gujranwala and Gujrat

State Bank of Pakistan has completed its four-day SME finance awareness campaign in
Sialkot, Gujranwala and Gujrat from March 13 to March 16, 2019 wherein meetings and
interactions were held with over 2,000 representatives of various SME clusters. Over 300
senior bankers including regional & zonal heads of the banks participated in these
programmes. Seven separate sessions were held in these cities whereas a large SME Finance
Mela was organized in Gujranwala in coordination with Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce
and Small & Medium Enterprises Development Authority.

In the inaugural session of the Mela, President Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce
addressed the participants and assured full support of the chamber for continuing
awareness programmes on SBP’s policies for SMEs.

In his key note address, Syed Samar Hasnain, Executive Director, State Bank of Pakistan,
informed the participants that the distinct feature of the Mela is that the banks offering
various SME products get connected with the SMEs desirous of availing financing facilities.
On-spot solutions to the problems being faced by participating SMEs were provided to them
in the Mela. Number of banks showed their interest in providing SME finance. Banks also
showed their interest in visiting Wazirabad Cutlery market to workout financing solutions for
over 900 SME vendors working in that market.

It may be recalled that State Bank of Pakistan conducted the awareness campaign because
lack of awareness on the part of SMEs was found as a key reason due to which SMEs could
not avail financing facilities available under SBP SME Finance Policy or SBP’s subsidized
refinance facilities. In order to improve awareness, banks have already been urged to provide
details of such facilities to the SMEs in their areas. The unique nature of the four-day
awareness campaign was that apart from face-to-face meetings with the stakeholders, each
day event was thoroughly covered by both print and electronic media. Day-end media talks
were held with local and national level media channels in the three cities for mass media
awareness at general public level.

International Strengthening Fund approves Rs 632 million

for MFBs/MFls: Kazi Abdul Muktadir

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Kazi Abdul Muktadir disclosed
today that the International Strengthening Fund (ISF) has so far approved Rs. 632 million for 13
microfinance providers including top and middle tier Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) and Micro
Finance Institutions (MFIs).

Inaugurating the 6"" Pakistan Micro Finance Conference at a local hotel in Karachi, he
said that under the ISF arrangements (a UK grant of 10 million British pounds facility), ISF has
supported 20 projects for investments in key areas such as human resources (HR), information
technology (IT), product development, risk management systems, business plans and
branchless banking development. ‘The Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN) was also provided
funding support under ISF to conduct research and develop the industry’s infrastructure such as
the testing of microfinance Credit Information Bureau (CIB) in Lahore and its expansion to the
national level,’ he added.

He said that the Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility (MCGF), a 10 million British
pound guarantee facility, has so far mobilized commercial funding of Rs.6,325/- million to four
microfinance providers for onward lending to around 200,000 new micro borrowers. ‘Going
forward, the facility will aim to raise commercial debt from non bank sources, diversifying
sources of commercial capital for microfinance providers,’ Mr. Abdul Muktadir added.

He said the Financial Innovation Challenge Fund (FICF), which is also a 10 million British
pound facility, will provide new ways of meeting the larger demand for financial services. He
said that the first round of the Fund which was held to promote the “Government to Persons
(G2P) Payments” has now been successfully completed by deciding to award Rs. 505 million to
six projects being undertaken by the applicant institutions. ‘The 2nd FICF Round would be held
on rural financial services including agricultural finance and broad based financial services
projects using telecommunication infrastructure to promote micro payments for people who
are not part of financial services’, he added.

SBP Deputy Governor observed that it is encouraging that the investors’ enthusiasm in
microfinance has been on the rise especially in the last couple of years, and one of the major
drivers for investors is the opportunity to enter the branchless banking space.

SBP Allows Local Businesses to Make Instant Payments for Acquiring Services from Globally
Recognized Digital Service Providers

 

In an effort to further enhance ease of doing business in Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has
introduced a new mechanism to enable the companies in Pakistan to make instant payments for
acquiring digital services from globally recognized digital service provider companies, without any
hassle. Now local companies can access various services including advertising, hosting, database access,
accounting management, skill development and customer support etc., from these global companies
instantaneously without any regulatory approval process. This facilitation will increase their outreach to
wider customer base locally and abroad, which would help them increase their footprint, productivity
and achieve greater efficiency.

In November 2019, State Bank introduced a framework for acquisition of services from abroad allowing
companies to acquire services after registration of its contract with SBP. However, some businesses
reported facing difficulty under this mechanism for making payments to Digital Service provider
companies. After an extensive consultative process with all the relevant stakeholders, a much simplified
process on ‘payment vs receipt basis’ has been introduced with annual limits, in addition to the existing
framework mentioned above.

Now, banks have general permission to release foreign exchange up to a maximum of USD 200,000 per
year for each local company on account of digital services, primarily in favor of 62 digital service
provider companies (including their affiliates or associated entities), listed in the Circular on SBP’s
website mentioned below. However, within this limit, authorized dealers can release foreign exchange
up to a maximum of USD 25,000 per annum to digital service providers not included in the list.

The banks may offer the digital channels to their clients, for making these payments. The circular issued
to banks announcing these measures can be _ accessed at the following link:

SBP extends FICF proposal submission deadline up to 25"" April, 2014

 

State Bank of Pakistan has extended the deadline for submission of proposals under Financial
Innovation Challenge Fund (FICF) 2™ Challenge Round on “Promoting Rural & Agricultural
Finance in Pakistan” up to April 25, 2014. The 2"" challenge round was unveiled on 6 March
2014 at local hotel in Islamabad.

FICF is component of the larger Financial Inclusion Program being implemented by State Bank
of Pakistan under the funding assistance of the UK Aid. The objective of the 2nd round is to

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

 

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has issued the following statement to the media at a
news conference held this evening at SBP Karachi:

‘State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been monitoring closely the recent developments regarding the overall and
bank specific liquidity position. Keeping in view overall liquidity condition of the market, SBP has decided to take
the following actions to ease the immediate liquidity situation and further incentivize banks to rely on medium /
long term balance sheet funding w.e.f. from 18th October 2008.

e Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for all deposits up to one year maturity is being reduced by 200bps to
6.00 percent. As a result of this decrease of 200bps, an additional liquidity of about Rs60 billion will be
released into the system. As communicated earlier there will be another 100bps reduction in CRR which
will bring it down to 5.00 percent w.e.f. 15th November 2008 and will add another Rs 30 billion.

e It has been decided to fully exempt the time deposits of 1 year tenor and above from Statutory Liquidity
Requirements (SLR). This will inject liquidity of about PAR 120 billion in the market.

e The reductions in CRR and exemption of Time Liabilities from SLR will release an aggregate liquidity of
over Rs180 billion immediately into the system and contribute significantly in alleviating the prevalent
liquidity strain in the market. In addition, another PKR 30 billion will be released on 15th November.
Cumulatively SBP between now and 15t* November, 2008 will have released liquidity of Rs 210 billion.

In order to ensure a prudent liquidity profile of the banking system, it has been decided to prescribe a maximum
Advances to Deposit Ratio (ADR) of 70 percent for banks. However, in order to ensure the smooth transition of
banks’ balance sheet to this requirement, a timeline up to March 31, 2009 is being allowed to banks whose
current ADR is above this ratio.

Pakistan’s banking sector is quite resilient and fully capable of withstanding market shocks and adverse macro
economic conditions. The lending and investments of the banks are subject to the stringent prudential
regulations of SBP that prohibit the banks from clean lending above prescribed limit and investment in low
quality assets.

State Bank of Pakistan is continuously monitoring the financial market in Pakistan and will take all necessary
policy measures to ensure the stability of the payment and financial system in the country.

It is reiterated that these are temporary measures aimed at accommodating extraordinary liquidity requirements
of the banking system and, therefore, should not be construed as a change in the monetary policy stance.

It may be recalled that SBP has also recently taken few other measures to improve liquidity position. These measures
included the injection of fresh liquidity into the system through OMOs, reduction in Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR)
by 1 percentage w.e.f. 11"" October, allowing of HTM securities for discounting purposes, and an increase in the SLR
eligibility limit of the PIBs from existing 5 percent to 10 percent of the TDL w.e.f 18"" October, 2008.’

SBP enhances Quarterly Compendium; provides detailed coverage on
performance and soundness of MFBs

In order to provide relevant and up to date information to the stakeholders about the state of the
affairs of the Banking System, State Bank of Pakistan(SBP) regularly publishes banking statistics
in the form of Quarterly Compendium (QC) on its website. The QC provides financial data as well
as information on key Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Banking System, Islamic Banking

(IB) and Development Financial Institutions(DFIs).

Considering the growing importance of financial inclusion and role of Microfinance Banks
(MFBs) therein, it has been decided to start publishing comprehensive data of MFBs in the QC
starting from third quarter of 2017(Q3CY17) onwards. Earlier some broad numbers on MFBs
have been published by SBP as part of its publications including “Development Finance Reviews”
and “Financial Stability Review”. The enhanced QC provides detailed information on
performance and Financial Soundness of MFBs, in addition to coverage of Banking System, IBs
and DFlIs. The QC also covers quarterly time series data of MFBs from fourth Quarter of
2008(Q4CY08) onwards.

The enhanced QC is available at URL: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/fsi.asp.

During the third quarter of FY15, the volume and value of Internet Banking transactions

Banks Disbursed Agricultural Credit of Rs 704.5 billion in FY 2016-17

Banks have surpassed the agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs. 700 billion set by Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) for FY 2016-17. Agri. Lending banks have disbursed Rs 704.5
billion which is 17.8% higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs 598.3 billion. Further, the agri.
outstanding portfolio increased to Rs 405.8 billion on end June, 2017 registering a hefty growth of
17.4% compared with the last year’s position of Rs 345.6 billion. Similarly, the agricultural credit
outreach has increased to 3.27 million farmers at end June 2017 from 2.40 million farmers last year.

The achievement of agri. credit disbursement target was an uphill task due to high risk perception of
banks about agri. financing and volatile prices of agri. commodities etc. However, SBP continued to
implement its multipronged strategy for achievement of agri-credit target set by government which
included; sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing as a viable business line, exploring new financing
products; value chain financing, warehouse receipts financing, digitalization of credit, execution of
credit guarantee scheme for small & marginalized farmers and inclusion of microfinance institutions/
rural support programs for catering the credit needs of marginalized farmers.

However, this achievement would have not been possible without the dynamic leadership of SBP and
active support of the Government. Further, monitoring efforts included rigorous follow up with the
top management of banks and agri. credit heads and holding of regular follow-up meetings with
regional management. Conducting farmers’ awareness and financial literacy programs at grass root
level were also instrumental.

The detailed credit performance reveals that five major banks collectively disbursed agri. loans of Rs
342.0 billion or 100.6% of their annual target of Rs 340.0 billion which is higher by 9.9% from Rs 311.4
billion disbursed during the corresponding period last year. Amongst the five major banks, NBP has
achieved 105 % of its annual target, MCB achieved 103.2%, HBL 101.1%, UBL 100.5% and ABL
achieved 85.4 % of individual annual targets.

Under specialized banks category, ZTBL disbursed Rs 92.5 billion or 90.2% of its annual target of Rs
102.5 billion while PPCBL has disbursed Rs 10.9 billion by achieving 87% against its target of Rs 12.5
billion during FY 2016-17.

Fifteen domestic private banks, as a group, achieved 99.6% of their target. Within this group Soneri
Bank, Bank of Punjab, Bank of Khyber, Bank Alfalah, Faysal Bank, JS Bank, Habib Metro, Summit and
Silk Bank have surpassed their annual targets. However, Sindh Bank achieved 94.3%, First Women
Bank 90.2%, Bank Al Habib 84%, Askari Bank 81% and Standard Chartered could achieve 73.5% of
their annual targets.

Ten microfinance banks, as a group, have surpassed their annual targets of Rs 60.1 billion by
disbursing agri. loans of Rs 87.8 billion or 146% to small farmers during FY 2016-17. Khushhali, NRSP
Microfinance Bank, Telenor MF, First Microfinance Bank, Mobilink and U Microfinance Bank have
surpassed their targets while APNA Micro Finance achieved 96%, Pak Oman 65.5% and Sindh
Microfinance Bank could achieve only 39.4% of its annual target.

SBP formulates Product Disclosure Requirements for all types of Personal,
Housing and Auto Finance products.

In order to help consumers to make informed decisions and enhance their confidence in _ financial
products, the State Bank of Pakistan has formulated Product Disclosure Requirements (PDRs) for all
types of Personal, Housing and Auto Finance products.

Banks/Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) are required to invariably provide an upfront ‘Product Key Fact
Statement’ (PKFS) to their prospective customers with effect from 1* January, 2017. The move is
aimed at enhancing the existing level of transparency and disclosure in the financial products as a
part of pre-disbursement procedure. Banks/MFBs may, however, add any further information in the
PKFS as deemed necessary. Moreover, banks/MFBs shall retain a duplicate copy of PKFS duly signed
by their customers and the authorized officer of the bank as per their record retention policy.

It merits mentioning here that in the wake of growing diversity and complexity in financial products,
making an informed decision is one of the challenges for the financial consumers. In this regard
relevant, reliable and comparable information on financial products, complemented with a robust
consumer protection framework is necessary to facilitate consumers and also to promote financial
inclusion and stability.

All banks/MFBs are advised to follow the attached PDRs in letter and spirit. Any deviation or non-
compliance of the same shall attract punitive action under the relevant provisions of the Banking
Companies Ordinance, 1962.

SBP advises Banks against Discriminating Consumer Finance Practices

In continuation to its earlier instructions, State Bank of Pakistan has advised
banks/development finance institutions (DFls) to not discriminate any segment of the society
and follow SBP instructions issued earlier which required banks / DFls to desist from adopting
discriminatory practices on the basis of trade, region, gender, ethnicity, specific profession,
class and / or group of citizens e.g. lawyers, politicians, security officials and law enforcement
agencies etc.

State Bank has stressed banks/DFls in its circular issued today that Politically Exposed Persons
(PEPs) have time and again raised their concerns regarding adoption of discriminatory practices
by banks in providing consumer finance and general banking facilities. SBP has further asked
banks / DFls to explicitly convey reasons of refusal in writing to the applicant and keep a
separate file of all approved and rejected cases of PEPs.

Such practices are against the spirit of fundamental rights ordained by the Constitution of
Pakistan and regulatory instructions on the subject and that these complaints have been
viewed seriously at the central bank of the country.

SBP has further stated in the circular that any violation of the instructions will attract punitive
action under relevant provisions of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962

STATE BANK’S INITIATIVES FOR THE PROMOTION OF EXPORTS

In an effort to support the country’s major export sector, SBP has been implementing few

incentives to the sector offered both by SBP and the Government. This has involved reduction in

refinance rates under Export Finance Scheme (EFS), debt swap option under rates and the Long

Term Finance Scheme for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP), and Research & Development

support. The initiatives have significant industry wide implications for sustaining export

momentum with the following encouraging results:

()

(ii)

(iii)

Export refinance of Rs 137.91 billion was released to banks during the period July
01, 2006 to 18"" November 2006 as against Rs 120 billion released during the same
period last year. Refinance under EFS is being offered at 6.5% i.e., 4-4.5% below 6-
month KIBOR and has so far resulted in a positive impact of Rs. 1.07 billion during

July-November 2006 for the export sector.

Pursuant to the announcement of the debt swap option under LTF-EOP, SBP has
provided refinance of about Rs 13.86 billion through commercial banks against 107
cases to the value added Textile industry in particular and six sub sectors of the
spinning sector in general. Over & above this, the industry has availed Rs 8.40 billion
under the Scheme for new projects. In aggregate, so far, more than Rs. 22 billion
refinance has been released under this scheme to commercial banks, since its
inception to 2nd December 2006.

Under Research and Development Support (R&D) scheme, all offices of SBP BSC
across the country have cumulatively released Rs 8.8 billion and cleared about
79,000 cases since July 2005. During July-October 2006 alone they processed

20,170 cases involving release of approx. Rs 2.7 billion.

With the above incentives, the industry was expected to rationalize its cost structure and

consequently increase exports. However, it is disappointing to note that exports of the sector

have shown negative growth for the current fiscal year (Jul-Oct 2006) as compared to an increase

of 30% during the corresponding period last year.

Amidst emerging positive economic trends, SBP is committed
to promote SME finance: Governor Bagir

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, and other senior officials of the Bank met
with senior representatives of FPCCI in Lahore on 7‘ September, 2019 at the invitation of
FPCCI Regional Office. SBP apprised the FPCCI members of its views on the economy and
SBP’s facilities and efforts to promote access to SME finance. SBP also listened to the issues
being experienced by members of the FPCCI in accessing SME finance.

‘The purpose of economic reforms is to definitively address the problems accumulated from
previous years, to bring stability inthe economy, and provide the foundations for sustainable
growth that is shared amongst the citizens,’ said the Governor SBP in his introductory
remarks. Adding further, he said that achieving these goals requires a partnership between
the private and public sectors. Elaborating his views, the Governor remarked ‘Early results
from the reforms are promising: the current account deficit, which was one of the principal
causes of our economic problems, has halved, export volumes have been growing, non-
borrowed reserves have stopped falling and in fact begun to grow, and inflation is projected
to start falling from the second half of the current fiscal year. Governor Bagir emphasized
that sustaining policy reforms and continuing a focus on growth friendly policies is the key
priority going forward.

On addressing SME finance issues, SBP officials explained that its key role in this space is to
provide an enabling regulatory environment through supportive prudential regulations and
to support market development by promoting risk mitigation mechanisms. They also
explained the key pillars of SBP’s Policy for Promotion of SME Finance to the business
community (http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/PolicyPromotionSME-Finance.pdf). Main
features of State Bank’s refinance facilities for SMEs and exporters were also explained in the
meeting. During the meeting, Dr. Reza Bagir highlighted that credit to SMEs increased from
Rs.288 billion in 2014 to Rs.513 billion in 2018. At the same time, he noted, that there is
tremendous potential to expand SME finance and that the relevant stakeholders need to
work together to achieve this goal.

 

Governor SBP also responded to questions of senior representatives of FPCCI and various
chambers of commerce. Mr. Iftikhar Ali Mailk, Senior Vice President SAARC CCl and Mr.
Abdul Rauf Mukhtar, Regional Chairman & Vice President FPCCI thanked Governor and other
officials of SBP for visiting FPCCI Lahore.

SBP corrects misreported facts

Apropos the news stories covering the visit of Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industries
by Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and SBP team some of the
facts mentioned during the Q&A session have been incorrectly reported. To keep the record
straight and avoid any misunderstanding, it is clarified that following facts were mentioned
during the meeting.

To a question comparing low credit to GDP ratio in the country with other countries and
attributing it to government borrowing SBP responded by saying that one reason for low credit
to GDP ratio is the presence of a large informal sector of the economy. Private sector credit is
already on rise and this could improve further with a higher tax to GDP ratio as higher tax
revenues would reduce government's borrowing needs.

During the speech of the Governor, numbers relating to major macroeconomic indicators,
including workers' remittances, were also shown in a slide. According to the slide, workers'
remittances stood at US$19.9 billion at the end of FY16, which grew by 11 percent during
2009-13. The news stories have reported 19.9 as the percent growth in workers’ remittances
during FY 16 which is not correct.

Master Guarantee Agreement signed between Credit Guarantee Trust for Low Income
Housing and Partner Financial Institutions

 

A Credit Guarantee Trust, with Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Corporation (PMRC) as Trustee,
has been set up by the Government of Pakistan with the support of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
and funded by the World Bank. In line with Government’s vision to promote affordable housing
specially for the low- and informal-income segments, the Credit Guarantee Trust will provide
risk coverage of up to 40% to primary mortgage financiers on first loss basis. The guarantee will
partially alleviate the credit risk of primary mortgage financiers and provide a conducive
environment for banks to finance housing for the low-income. Keeping in view the dynamics of
mortgage market and to facilitate market growth, the scheme has been designed for both
conventional and Islamic banks.

PMRC as trustee today signed a Master Guarantee Agreement with six leading Islamic and
conventional banks including Meezan Bank, Habib Bank, Banklislami, Faysal Bank, JS Bank and
Soneri Bank. This is a major step for the Government’s Naya Pakistan Housing Program and
making affordable housing possible for all.

Speaking at the occasion, Deputy Governor SBP Mr. Jameel Ahmed said that the risk coverage
of mortgage portfolio under Government Markup Subsidy facility provides due comfort to
banks in extending housing finance to the low income segment for buying or construction of
new houses. He urged the banking industry to benefit from this unprecedented facilitative
environment and extend loans to their maximum potential. He also urged the PMRC to focus on
developing secondary mortgage market through issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the
capital market. The Deputy Governor SBP emphasized that all stakeholders needed to make
concerted efforts to achieve the goal of providing housing to the common people. He lauded
the efforts by financial institutions over the last few months under the umbrella of Steering
Committee on housing and construction finance established by State Bank of Pakistan.

Mudassir H. Khan, MD and CEO of PMRC, expressing his views said that this Credit Guarantee
Scheme will pave the way for the banking industry to extend housing finance to the low income
group, a market segment which has remained negligible for long. He said that PMRC has a role
of a catalyst in mortgage market development in the country and for growth of affordable
housing in the country. He thanked the Deputy Governor SBP for his leadership and support for
this sector, the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank and NAPHDA towards making the
Government and PM’s vision of affordable housing a reality.

SBP issues Revised Instructions on Independent Directors

Since last financial crisis most of the countries have revised their regulatory instructions
particularly focusing on the enhanced role of Independent Directors in the ever-changing
pace of the financial markets. Accordingly, SBP has also issued revised instructions on
Independent Directors of the banks/Development Finance Institutions; highlights of the same
are as follow:

Revision of the definition of Independent Director has been made, keeping in view the
domestic regulatory/legal regime and international best practices. New definition is
somewhat more stringent than the previous one. Thus it will help in identifying and
preventing conflict of interest situation to a greater extent. Minimum number of
Independent Directors has been increased from 25% to 33% of the total Board members with
effect from March 31, 2018. Separate meeting of the Independent Directors of a bank/DFI
has been suggested at least once in a year.

It is the core responsibility of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to ensure financial stability of the
banking industry by providing continuous supervisory support and guidance. For the purpose,
SBP endeavors to strengthen the good governance regime in the banking industry through
continuously reviewing and updating its regulatory instructions to cope with the domestic
challenges as well as to stay in line with the international best practices and standards.

Acting Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra
outlines six-point-action plan to boost agri. financing in
the Country

The Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has announced a six-point
action plan for boosting agricultural financing in the country.

Addressing a meeting of Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) at SBP, Karachi today he
outlined his action plan that includes (i) the launch of Financial Innovation Challenge Fund (FICF) in
Rural & Agriculture Finance to foster innovation and test new markets, lower cost of delivery,
streamlining systems and procedures to provide more efficient new ways of meeting the larger demands of
farming community; (ii) launch of country-wide Internship Program for 100 top agri. Graduates to be
funded under the ADB’s Improving Access to Financial Services Endowment Fund; (iii) upward revision
in the provisional agri. disbursement target of Rs 360 billion to Rs 380 billion for 2013-14 in the light of
banks’ encouraging performance in the last two years. The target is 13% higher from Rs 336 billion
disbursed in 2012-13; (iv) banks to be assigned targets for outstanding agri. portfolio and number of
borrowers to have high impact of agri. financing at grass root level from the current year; (v) SBP to make
agricultural finance a key indicator of performance of banks, including Islamic banks, which will be
reflected in their supervisory ratings; and (vi) formulation of a Working Group to review the state of
affairs of small farmers financing and making recommendations for increasing financing to this segment
and also bringing in additional small farmers into formal financing system.

Referring to the potential of agriculture sector in the economic development of Pakistan, Mr. Wathra said
that Pakistan is the 9th largest producer of wheat, 4th largest producer of cotton and 12th largest producer of
rice in the world. ‘Similarly, Pakistan is ranked one of the top ten largest producers in minor agriculture
commodities. Pakistan ranks 8th worldwide in farm output’, he added.

Mr. Wathra said that agri. finance is close to his heart as he comes from an agriculturist background. ‘Hence
it has become one of his top priorities since he joined it (SBP)’, he added.

He also urged the farmers’ representatives and government departments to contribute in the efforts of banks
and address the demand side bottlenecks including low yield, proper marketing & storage, water
efficiencies, land record management, adoption of modern techniques, mechanization and other agri.
innovations.

Mr. Wathra said that despite structural shift towards industrialization, agriculture sector continues to remain
the vital sector of our economy with its backward and forward linkages with other sectors of the economy
having strong socio-economic implications. ‘It is the second largest sector, accounting for over 21% of
GDP’, he added.

He shared with the audience some of the key initiatives taken recently by SBP. State Bank of Pakistan has
revised Prudential Regulations (PRs) for Agriculture Financing whereby banks have been urged to formulate
comprehensive agri. finance policies and set up dedicated divisions/units within banks, well equipped by
trained professional staff, to promote agricultural credit. ‘Further, the scope of agri. financing has been
widened by including Islamic as well as value chain financing aspects in the revised agri. PRs’, he added.

537,2021-01-22 00:00:00+00:00,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE
STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
January 22, 2021

1. At its meeting on 224 January 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the
policy rate at 7 percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in November, the domestic recovery has
gained some further traction. Most economic activity data and indicators of consumer and business sentiment
have shown continued improvement. As a result, there are upside risks to the current growth projection of
slightly above 2 percent in FY21. On the inflation front, recent out-turns are also encouraging, suggesting a
waning of supply-side price pressures from food and still-benign core inflation. While utility tariff increases
may cause an uptick in inflation, this is likely to be transient given excess capacity in the economy and well-
anchored inflation expectations. As a result, inflation is still expected to fall within the previously announced
range of 7-9 percent for FY21 and trend toward the 5-7 percent target range over the medium-term. With the
inflation outlook relatively benign aside from the possibility of temporary supply-side shocks, the MPC felt
that the existing accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to support the nascent
recovery while keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability.

2. While noting these favorable growth and inflation developments, the MPC also stressed that considerable
uncertainty remains around the outlook. The trajectory of the Covid pandemic is difficult to predict, given
still-elevated global cases, the emergence of new strains, and lingering uncertainties about the roll-out of
vaccines worldwide. Such external shocks could slow the recovery. In light of such Covid-related
uncertainties, the MPC considered it appropriate to provide some forward guidance on monetary policy to
facilitate policy predictability and decision-making by economic agents. In the absence of unforeseen
developments, the MPC expects monetaty policy settings to remain unchanged in the near term. As the
recovery becomes more durable and the economy returns to full capacity, the MPC expects any adjustments
in the policy rate to be measured and gradual to achieve mildly positive real interest rates.

3. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Real sector

4. The economic recovery underway since July has strengthened in recent months. Large-scale
manufacturing (LSM) grew by 7.4 percent (y/y) in October and 14.5 percent (y/y) in November. The
manufacturing recovery is also becoming more broad-based, with 12 out of 15 subsectors registering positive
growth in November and employment beginning to recover. So far this fiscal year, LSM has grown by 7.4
percent (y/y), against a contraction of 5.3 percent during the same period last year. Nevertheless, the level of
manufacturing activity generally remained below average levels in FY19, pointing to continued spare capacity
in the economy. On the demand side, cement sales remain strong on the back of rising construction activity,
POL sales are at two-year highs, and automobile sales are also rising in both urban (motorcars) and rural
(tractors) markets. In agriculture, cotton output is likely to decline more than expected based on latest
production estimates. However, this is likely to be offset by improved growth in other major crops and higher
wheat production due to the rise in support prices along with announced subsidies on fertilizers and
pesticides for Rabi crops. While social distancing is still affecting some service sectors, wholesale, retail trade
and transportation are expected to benefit from improvements in construction and manufacturing activity.

The banking sector continues its steady expansion,
says the Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector

 

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for
the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Q1CY17) on June 9, 2017. The document has highlighted that the
asset base of the banking sector has expanded due to rise in both the advances and investments
supported by marginal rise in deposits and increase in borrowings from financial institutions. The
profitability of the banking sector has moderated while the asset quality has improved and the capital
adequacy remains at satisfactory level.

Against the usual pattern of seasonal retirement of advances during first quarter of a calendar year,
Q1CY17 witnessed an uptick in private sector advances. Besides corporate sector’s borrowing for fixed
investments, a healthy growth in production of sugarcane led to higher levels of borrowing by both
public and private sectors under financing for sugar. The corporate sector, capitalizing on the low
interest rates and improved business environment, has been enhancing its longer-term exposures,
thereby strengthening the capital formation. Within consumer finance, auto and mortgage finance have
mainly contributed towards the growth of this sub-segment. Moreover, Islamic banking industry has
contributed significantly in growth in overall advances.

Deposits, the key funding source of the banking sector, have increased by 0.1 percent in Q1UCY17 in
contrast to 0.6 percent contraction in Q1CY16. Flow of funds have largely been seen in savings (PKR 54
billion), current account-remunerative (PKR 44 billion) and others categories. Apart from deposits,
borrowings from financial institutions provided the funding necessary for asset expansion.

Asset quality of the banking sector has improved with decline in non-performing loans ratio to 9.9
percent. This positive development has been brought about by a decline of 2.4 percent (YoY) in NPLs
and a strong growth of 15.5 percent (YoY) in advances. The infection ratio stands at its lowest level since
2009.

The banking sector has posted profit after tax of PKR 49 billion during Q1CY17 compared to PKR 52
billion in QL1CY16. This moderation in profits coupled with growth in assets narrowed down the ROA to
1.2 percent (1.5 percent as of end March, 2016).

Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has slightly adjusted downwards to 15.9 percent during Q1ICY17 mainly
due to continuing growth in private sector advances. Banks are well positioned from solvency
standpoint as the prevailing CAR is well above the minimum required level of 10.65 percent.

SBP makes elaborate arrangements for currency management and banking
operations during Ramazan and Eid ul Fitr

During every Ramazan and Eid ul Fitr, SBP makes special arrangements to facilitate public
for cash requirements and banking related services. This year, SBP has made even more
elaborate efforts to serve the general public. These measures are aimed at providing hassle
free financial services to the general public during holy Ramazan, forthcoming Edi-ul-Fitr and

verification teams of SBP-BSC field offices during the period 1° July 2016 till 10"" July 2016
to verify their operational status.

In view of the extended Eid holidays, banks have also been advised to intimate SBP BSC
Field Offices, in advance, about the extra cash that they may need so that adequate
arrangements could be made for replenishing their ATMs during Eid Holidays. Banks will
also make certain that in addition to ATMs, continuous services are also available on Point of
Sale (POS) and other Alternate Delivery Channels (ADC) Channels.

Banks have also been instructed to ensure that dedicated teams from commercial banks are
available for timely resolution of ATM related complaints; contact numbers of banks’
Helpline are prominently displayed on ATM vestibules and advertised in print media for the
facilitation of general public. Also, call centers of commercial banks will remain available
24/7 for quick redressal of all customer complaints.

facilitation of the members of general public. Commercial banks will accept financial
instruments from their customers on 2°¢ and 9° July 2016 for normal clearing only and

SBP to facilitate establishment of Infrastructure Development
Bank, Mortgage Refinance Company: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that the central bank is
working on the establishment of Infrastructure Development Bank and Mortgage
Refinance Company under Public-Private Partnership for the growth and development
of infrastructure and housing sector in the country.

Presiding over a meeting of Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) held at
State Bank today, Mr. Raza said that the State Bank has taken several initiatives for
enhancing credit disbursement to underserved segments i.e. agriculture, SME,
microfinance, housing and infrastructure.

“State Bank is playing its due role to stimulate private sector credit off-take and
to turnaround economic slowdown,” he said. He, however, stressed upon the private
sector to come forward with well thought out project plans so that banks are able to
finance them. “I strongly believe that growth stimulus has to come from agriculture and
SME sectors,” he added.

Talking about overall scenario of private sector credit disbursement, Mr. Raza
noted that decelerating trend of credit disbursement has been arrested and lately
disbursement has picked up. He pointed out that overall decline in credit disbursement
was limited to Rs 28 billion as of July-November 7, 2009 compared with a decline of Rs
81 billion till July-September 2009. He said that the share of private sector credit in total
credit has declined from 61% as at end Dec 2008 to 53.3% by 7th November 2009 due to
continuous contraction in PSC and enhanced flow of credit to government sector & PSEs
during the last three quarters.

Referring to reasons behind low credit off-take, Mr. Raza said that prolonged
power shortages and poor security situation had an adverse impact on industrial
production which grew by a mere 0.2% in July-August 2009. Similarly, decline in exports
exhibited some impact of global recession particularly in major export destination like
the USA and the European Union which have witnessed one of their worst economic
slowdown during last two quarters of 2008 and in the first three quarters of 2009.

Economy needs effective policies and reforms
to regain stability: SBP First Quarterly Report

Pakistan needs effective policies and implementation of reforms in fiscal year 2008-09
(FYO9) to regain macroeconomic stability and meet economic challenges, according to State
Bank of Pakistan’s First Quarterly Report for FYO9 released today.

The Report, however, pointed out that the sense of crisis gripping the country’s
economy in the initial months of FYO9 has visibly eased by November 2008, as the Government
moved to address the most immediate risks, and entered into a macroeconomic stabilization
program to support medium-term reforms under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund.

It said the disbursement of the first tranche of $3.0 billion by end-November 2008 under
the program meant that any immediate risk of default on external obligations receded, with a
substantial improvement in foreign exchange reserve adequacy indicators. Also, export growth
has strengthened and import growth moderated somewhat. “This lent strength to the rupee,
reducing the impact of an important generator of inflationary pressures,” it added.

The Report said the gain on the external account was helped by a sharp decline in
international commodity prices that is expected to substantially lower the country’s import bill,
offering the possibility of a decline in the country’s very large current account deficit, and lower
inflation. “This supply-side improvement has been reinforced by the reasonably good
performance of crops during kharif FYO9 cropping season,” it said and added these factors
appear to have already halted the persistent uptrend in inflationary pressures in the economy.
Together, they could also help support a very modest improvement in the growth outlook for
FYO9.

There is also substantial progress on containing fiscal imbalances, with the government
moving bravely to reduce subsidies, contain growth in other spending and increase revenues,
the Report said and added the result has been an encouraging improvement in some fiscal
indicators, including a sharp fall in the fiscal deficit from 1.5 percent of GDP during Q1-FY08 to 1
percent of GDP in Q1-FYO9. “This figure appears consistent with the annual target embedded in
the macroeconomic stabilization program framework,” it added.

However, notwithstanding the relative positives, there is no room for complacency, the
Report asserted. “While many of the country’s macroeconomic indicators may no longer be
worsening, the imbalances are nonetheless still quite large,” it said and added resolving them
will require disciplined efforts over an extended timeframe. “This challenge is all the greater
because of the difficult international economic environment, which has restricted the country’s
ability to tap international capital markets and carries risks for other external receipts (exports,
remittances, FDI, etc.),” it said.

The Report said that real Gross Domestic Product growth is likely to be significantly
lower than the annual target and inflation will breach its target with a wide margin. On a
positive note, however, both fiscal and current account deficits are estimated to improve in
FYO9, it added.

SBP extends its relief package to borrowers availing loans under Refinance Schemes

State Bank of Pakistan has continuously been reviewing the challenges arising out of COVID-19
pandemic situation with particular reference to the financial sector and taking measures. Expanding
the scope of its recently announced relief package for households and businesses, SBP has taken
another major step today. State Bank has allowed similar relaxations, as provided under the relief
package, on its concessional refinance schemes. Under various refinance schemes loans are provided
with preferential terms and conditions to promote growth in priority sectors of the economy. Now the
relaxation allowed for deferment in repayment of principal amount for one year for corporate,
consumer, agriculture, SMEs and microfinance sectors, will now be available on financing of banks/
DFls under SBP’s refinance schemes as well. With this deferment of principal, the complete repayment
schedule/tenor of the loan will be extended by one year. The borrowers will, however, continue
servicing their mark up during the period of principal deferment. In case borrowers are not able to
service mark-up payment, banks/DFls may reschedule/restructure the loan in such a manner that tenor
of the loan can go up to one year beyond the existing maximum tenor of the respective scheme.
Borrowers of SBP’s following refinance schemes and their Shariah alternatives would benefit from this

relaxation:

e Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF)

e Financing Facility for Storage of Agricultural Produce (FFSAP)

e Refinance Facility for Modernization of SMEs

e Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs

e Refinance Scheme for Working Capital Financing of Small Enterprises and Low-End Medium

SBP expands the scope of National Financial Literacy Program to all
over Pakistan

In order to create awareness about the National Financial Literary Program (NFLP) and more
specifically, sensitize the masses regarding the on-ground execution, a dedicated NFLP mass
media campaign is being launched from January 15, 2019 through print, radio and social media.

It is important to mention here that the program launched on pilot basis from August 2017 in 77
districts of the country, has now entered into the second year of implementation. The scope of
the project has been extended to all 158 districts of the country. The education on different
financial themes like budgeting, savings, investments, debt management, consumers’ rights &
obligations, Islamic banking, branchless banking and currency management is imparted through
dedicated half-day class room trainings.

SBP is implementing NFLP as one of its flagship programs to provide basic financial education to
unbanked & low-income strata, especially the youth & women. The program is funded from Asian
Development Bank’s ‘Improving Access to Finance Facility’ and is being rolled-out in different
phases to complete its objective of reaching one million beneficiaries in 5 years, through a unique
public private model, which engages banking institutions and SBP-BSC field offices to impart NFLP
messages in far-flung areas of Pakistan.

NFLP aims to empower public to make better & effective decisions regarding the use of financial
and allied services. Further, it will enhance competitiveness, foster innovations and increase
efficiency of the financial industry to provide better financial services to financially educated
citizens.

A dedicated NFLP toll free helpline and a dedicated website would also be launched from January
15, 2019 to facilitate public in getting information about the program, its features, schedule of
ground iterations or any other information they deem require.

Governor SBP shares developments in financial inclusion and roadmap with special
focus on gender mainstreaming with Queen Maxima, UNSGSA

Her Majesty (HM) Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in her role as the UN Secretary General’s Special
Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA) called on Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor State
Bank of Pakistan at Islamabad. The Special Advocate and Governor Baqir discussed how inclusive
financial technology (fintech) and digital finance represent a great opportunity to improve people’s
financial lives, while noting it is important to consider and mitigate risks associated with it.

At the outset of the meeting, Governor highlighted SBP’s initiatives, commitment and achievements
for increasing financial inclusion under National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2023. The Governor
also shared with the UNSGSA, the high impact development initiatives including gender mainstreaming
in financial inclusion, creation of Innovation Office within the central bank, establishment of Micro
Payment Gateway (MPG) and regulatory framework for Fintechs.

The Governor said that SBP, being mindful of the rising gender gap in access and usage of financial
services in Pakistan, has decided to launch a policy to reduce the gender gap in financial inclusion.
Accordingly, the Governor presented the draft policy on gender mainstreaming to the UNSGSA, which
aims to introduce a gender lens within the financial sector through identified pillars and specific
measures.

Governor Baqir also deliberated that SBP is exploring ways to encourage innovation for financial
inclusion through fintech by creating an Innovation Office at SBP. The Governor while appreciating the
UNSGSA, for her efforts to promote financial inclusion globally invited her to share her views on both
the SBP initiatives of policy for reducing gender gap in financial inclusion and innovation office.

Speaking on the occasion, UNSGSA Queen Maxima remarked that she was very happy to return to
Pakistan and valued the discussion with State Bank on financial inclusion. She appreciated the progress
made by SBP and Pakistan with respect to financial inclusion while focusing on gender mainstreaming
and digital financial services. The UNSGSA pointed out that Pakistan is in good position for a boost in
technology-enabled financial inclusion and that in the last five years, Pakistan’s start-up tech and
fintech ecosystems have made some notable progress with improving their supporting networks.

The UNSGSA mentioned it could be helpful to establish a pro-poor gateway for the wider acceptance
of micropayment methods, introducing consumers to micropayments on a large scale. She was
supportive of the steps taken by SBP to create a micropayment gateway in 2020. She, however, added
that while resolving technical issues are important, it is more challenging to encourage people in
engaging with digital modes of payment. Adding further, the UNSGSA emphasized that in this regard
inclusion of new players is important, whereby they should not only be competing but participating to
expand the delivery of services as well.

Finally, the Governor and the UNSGSA agreed to continue sharing ideas and follow up on agreed tasks
for promoting financial inclusion. The Governor thanked the UNSGSA, Queen Maxima for personal
commitment and pushing forward the agenda of financial inclusion as a means for achieving inclusive
development.

SBP releases First Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan released its First Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy for
the fiscal year 2020-21 today covering the period July — September, 2020.

The report finds that there were encouraging indications during Q1-FY21 that Pakistan’s economy was
regaining its pre-Covid trajectory. The recovery in economic activities was evident across the
agriculture, industry, and services sectors. Importantly, external and fiscal sector indicators also
remained favorable, indicating that the emerging recovery was being achieved while keeping
macroeconomic stability intact. The report notes that a timely and well-calibrated economic policy
response to the Covid crisis from the government and the SBP helped to prevent a deeper fallout from
the crisis and lay the foundations for economic recovery.

Specifically, in the external sector, the current account posted a surplus, primarily due to robust
workers’ remittances, rebound in exports, and lower services imports. Continued policy measures
under the Pakistan Remittance Initiative and the promotion of formal and digital channels played a
major role in driving remittances up. The Covid-related international air travel restrictions also helped
divert remittances from informal to formal channels, while dampening the level of Pakistan’s services
imports at the same time. Import payments were relatively lower during the first quarter compared to
last year due to a sharp fall in global oil prices. Meanwhile, export receipts recovered from the lows in
last quarter of the last fiscal year but were somewhat lower compared to the Q1-FY20, with demand
remaining soft among key trading partners. Nonetheless, Pakistan’s export performance was relatively
better compared to a number of other emerging markets, partly due to the early resumption of
economic activity. As a result, exports regained their pre-Covid trajectory in September, helped by
higher export receipts for textiles, cement and pharmaceuticals.

On the whole, the current account surplus provided a further boost to the country’s FX reserves and
strengthened the exchange rate during the quarter. The important shock-absorbing quality of the
market-determined exchange rate was also evident during the quarter, as the PKR adjusted flexibly in
both directions in line with underlying external sector fundamentals and flows.

It is worth highlighting that the national effort to mitigate the fallout of the pandemic, in the form of
timely and calibrated policy interventions of the government and the SBP, provided a conducive
environment for economic recovery to take root. Specifically, the fiscal and monetary policies in place
represented an accommodative policy environment compared to the demand compression focus a
year earlier amid high inflation and twin fiscal and current account deficits. This shift was instrumental
in facilitating economic activity following the easing of domestic lockdowns to contain the first wave of
Covid.

Within industry, the report highlights notable growth in cement and food processing sectors, as well as
a revival in the automobile sector. Demand indicators such as cement dispatches, POL and car sales,
power generation, consumer financing, and fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) sales showed a
corresponding uptick. In line with the growth in LSM, there was also growth in employment reflected,
inter alia, in the July-August 2020 monthly surveys of industrial employment compiled by the statistical
bureaus of Punjab and Sindh. These encouraging developments were also reflected in the SBP’s
Business Confidence Survey of August, with the business community’s sentiments turning positive for
the first time since February 2020.

Senate Ch. Aitzaz Ahsan and Member National Assembly Maulana Fazal Ur Rehman) from SME Bank
and transactions in their accounts was investigated by the State Bank of Pakistan. Initial results reveal
that no such TDRs have been issued by the SME Bank nor any of these parliamentarians have any
deposit account with the said bank. It is clarified that the bank issues TDRs only for those of its
customers who already have a deposit account with the said bank. It appears that the TDRs have
been issued using counterfeit or stolen TDR Forms from the bank by some unscrupulous elements to
malign the Parliamentarians. Further investigations in the matter are underway and will be shared in
due course. The SME Bank is also taking up the matter with the relevant law enforcement agency for

further investigation.

Growth in advances to private sectors exceeds historical
trend, says the SBP’s Fourth Quarterly Report for CY16

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector
for the quarter ended 31 December, 2016 (Q4CY16) today. In terms of the QPR, the key highlight of
the quarter is the impressive growth in advances to private sector; highest 4"" quarter growth in the
last 10 years. The solvency profile of the banking sector remains robust as Capital Adequacy Ratio
(CAR) of 16.17 percent is well above the minimum required level of 10.65 percent. Deposit growth
has remained on steady path while 4"" quarter’s profit has improved over last years’ though entire
year’s profit slightly narrowed owing to low interest rate environment.

The report highlights that the asset base of the banking sector has expanded by 4.6 percent in
Q4CY16. The key contribution has come from demand for credit from private sector; thanks to lag
impact of monetary easing, better economic conditions, and improved liquidity. Positively, a bounce
back in the advances flow has been observed in the textile sector; the largest borrower of the
banking sector. Besides, sugar, energy, agribusiness, and cement are some other sectors which have
availed major financing from the banking sector in Q4CY16. Banks’ investments, however, have
fallen by 1.5 percent during Q4CY16 mainly on account of decline in investments in government
securities.

Deposits — the key funding source of the banking sector - have observed growth of 6.4 percent in
Q4CY16 (13.6 percent growth in the Calendar Year 2016). The addition in the overall deposits has
been contributed by non-remunerative current deposits followed by fixed deposits and saving
deposits. The report highlights that the high deposit growth in the 4"""" quarter as well in the entire
year is a welcome sign considering deceleration in deposit growth observed in the last couple of
years.

The asset quality of the banking sector has improved with decline in non-performing loans (NPLs)
and corresponding ratios. Particularly, NPLs to loans ratio receded to 10.1 percent, the lowest level
in eight years. Importantly, besides pick up in advances, recoveries in NPLs have played a pivotal role
in bringing the ratio down. The coverage ratio (provisions to NPLs), has jumped up to 85.0 percent in
QACY16 (82.7 percent in Q3CY16).

The dip in interest margins and reduced quantum of investment has narrowed the Year-to-Date
profitability of the banking sector. As a result, return on assets (RoA) has declined to 2.1 percent as
compared to 2.5 percent in Q4CY15. However, strong solvency remains intact as CAR of 16.17
percent as of December 31, 2016 is well above the minimum required level of 10.65 percent.

State Bank clarifies prize bond issue

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued the following clarification regarding 20,000 missing pieces of prize
bond forms of Rs. 1500 bearing serial numbers AW070001 to AWO090000:

A consignment of un-stamped prize bond forms was dispatched by SBP Lahore Office for receipt at SBP
Karachi Office via 16 Down Karachi Express on May 08, 2014. The train departure from Lahore was
delayed by approximately 12 hours and reached Karachi Cantt behind schedule. As per the Federal
Treasury Rules, the Lahore remitting office hands over the treasure to Police Escort and it moves in their
custody till it is received at the Karachi destination office.

The brake railway car carrying the treasure was unlocked at Karachi in the presence of all concerned
including Police Escort and to their dismay they found one box out of the ten was missing. On further
investigation, it transpired that one of the panels of the brake railway car was found to be tampered and
broken into.

SBP has issued ‘Stop Payment’ instruction to all SBP BSC Offices, commercial Banks and Central
Directorate of National Savings (CDNS), in respect of the missing un-stamped prize bond forms.

Moreover, CDNS has been requested to notify withdrawal of above serial numbers from circulation with
immediate effect through Finance Division, Ministry of Finance by issuing Gazette Notification in
exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 4(1&2) of the Prize Bond Rules 1999, so that these bonds do
not remain eligible for encashment/prize money.

SBP implements Regulatory Approval System for ease of doing business

SBP has launched a Regulatory Approval System (RAS) for submission of cases related to foreign
exchange policy and operations dealt by its Exchange Policy Department (EPD), SBP and Foreign
Exchange Operations Department (FEOD), SBP-BSC respectively. SBP RAS, which has become
operational from March 24"", 2020, provides an online platform to banks to interact with the SBP/SBP-
BSC for submission of cases and receiving regulatory decisions.

Bringing ease of doing business, a key feature of the system is to keep the business customers updated
about the status of their requests routed through banks from the day it is received at SBP. Customers
will receive system-generated update status reports, at their email address provided by bank, from the
time of case submission till completion. Customers will also be able to check out the updated status of
their cases on SBP’s website anytime.

Using SBP RAS, banks will electronically submit foreign exchange operations related cases to the
Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD). The paper based submission of cases by Authorized
Dealers to FEOD has been abolished forthwith. Similarly, foreign exchange policy related cases
pertaining to Exchange Policy Department (EPD) will also be submitted electronically through SBP RAS.
However, for EPD, in addition to electronic submission, manual submission of cases through surface
mail will continue, for the time being, till further instructions.

SBP RAS is expected to conserve resources and bring efficiency by allowing timely FX-regulatory
approvals and replacing the paper based submissions that are prone to logistic and storage issues and
unnecessary delays. SBP RAS is a step towards digitalization intended to leverage technology for
improving public service and promoting ease of doing business in the country. The initiative is a part of
SBP’s Vision 2020 under which a Knowledge Management Project was initiated aiming to implement a
modern framework for the retention and sharing of information and knowledge.

Microfinance-exclusive Credit Information Bureau to reduce
risk of multiple borrowing & loan defaults: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that Microfinance-exclusive
Credit Information Bureau will help Microfinance Banks (MFBs) and Microfinance Institutions (MFls) in
developing robust risk management system and practices, which in turn reduce the risk of multiple
borrowing and loan defaults.

Delivering his key-note address at the national roll-out of Microfinance-exclusive Credit
Information Bureau (MF-CIB) at SBP Learning Resource Centre (LRC) Auditorium in Karachi today, he said
the MF-CIB will open access to credit for millions of potential poor borrowers and reduce the credit risk
cost of the lenders, besides lowering the loan price for the borrowers.

Mr. Anwar pointed out that at present even the credit-worthy borrowers of microfinance
institutions face difficulty in accessing larger loans from MFBs or commercial banks due to non-
availability of their long history of loans and timely repayments with a microfinance institution. ‘The MF-
CIB will facilitate in the ‘graduation’ of such livelihood-based workers into small entrepreneurs,’ he
added.

He said that this nation-wide MF-CIB will be a major step for both lenders and borrowers with
positive impact. ‘As the CIB expands its operations across the country, the quality and efficiency of the
loan appraisal process will improve significantly, he added.

SBP believes that a policy framework for credit bureaus is essential for their smooth and long-
term growth, he said, adding that the Government and SBP have already been working on the
development of a legal framework, which will strengthen private CIBs by establishing criteria for
licensing, issuing regulations, and creating oversight mechanism. ‘All this will result into stakeholders’
satisfaction, and, most importantly, it will boost public confidence,’ he added.

He said that SBP has played a sterling role in the development of microfinance sector as an
alternative to conventional banking to serve the lower end of the market. ‘However, there is a global
shift from microfinance to inclusive finance, that is, from supporting microfinance initiatives in isolation
to building inclusive financial sector,’ he added.

Financial inclusion, which is a core component of SBP’s financial sector development strategy,
will also stimulate economic growth for the country, he said, adding that it envisages transforming the
financial market into an equitable system with efficient market-based financial services to the otherwise
excluded poor and marginalized population including women and young people.

Mr. Anwar urged upon the CEOs/Presidents of MFBs and MFls to improve corporate
governance, management structures and put in place adequate systems & policies in their respective
organizations for ensuring protection of consumer rights. SBP is already in the process of revising
regulations to ensure that MFBs follow best standards in these critical areas, he said and added: ‘We
count on your wisdom and commitment to reach out to millions of financially excluded people.’

Monetary Policy Statement
July 30, 2016

Pakistan economy posted notable improvements in FY16 as average annual CPI inflation
declined to a 47 year low of 2.9 percent and real GDP growth touched an 8-year high of 4.7
percent. Foreign exchange reserves held by SBP recorded steady increases and while covering
four months of imports stood at USD18.1 billion by end-June 2016. Government's efforts at
reducing budget deficit remained on track as its revenue collection exceeded expectations.
Private sector credit posted a considerable surge with accelerating loans for fixed investment
and working capital. Growth in broad money was contained as the government borrowing
remained lower. Discreetly evaluating the outlook of these improvements, SBP cut its policy
rate by a cumulative 75bps in FY16; over and above cut of 300bps in FY15.

Both external and domestic factors have contributed towards improvement of the economy. On
the external front, despite a decline in exports growth, foreign exchange market remained
broadly stable due to lower oil prices, healthy workers’ remittances, and adequate official
capital inflows. While on the domestic side, an increase in FBR revenues has helped in
increasing development spending, while at the same time maintaining fiscal deficit close to the
target level.

Although increased demand for currency and at times government borrowing from commercial
banks kept the money market under pressure, effective injections to keep the market sufficiently
liquid by SBP has helped in a better transmission of monetary policy. This was visible in
overnight repo rate which on average remained closer to the policy rate. Overall, 6-month

KIBOR has seen a steeper 93bps reduction in FY16, compared to a 75 bps reduction in the policy
rate during May 2015 to May 2016. Thus, in turn, it has helped in a remarkable increase of Rs461
billion in private sector credit in FY16, compared to Rs224 billion in FY15. This indicates that
existing lending rates together with the provision of liquidity are supporting the accelerating
pace of private sector credit.

Going forward in FY17, factors affecting the outlook for external sector are broadly similar to
that of FY16. Even with a slight increase in current account deficit, on account of expected
higher non-oil imports, positive growth in workers’ remittances are likely to keep it at
manageable levels. At the same time, substantial bilateral and multilateral project loans related
flows in the financial account will help maintain an overall surplus in the balance of payments.
Further addition to this surplus is likely to come from increased foreign portfolio investments
on the back of reclassification of Pakistani stock market in the Emerging Markets Index by
MSCI.

Pakistan's economy maintained its growth momentum
during FY16, says SBP’s quarterly report

State Bank of Pakistan has today released its Third Quarterly Report for FY16 on the state of
Pakistan’s Economy. According to the Report, Pakistan's economy maintained its growth momentum
during FY16, despite suffering from heavy losses in the agriculture sector.

The Report particularly highlighted the acceleration in industrial and services sectors’ growth on the
back of better energy supply and improvement in security situation in the country.

Other key macro-economic indicators also improved during FY16, the Report noted. For example,
average CPI inflation was almost half the level seen last year. In the meanwhile, inflationary
expectations also subdued. This ease in inflation primarily came on the back of continued low
commodity prices in the global markets (and its swift pass through to domestic consumers,
particularly for POL products), comfortable supplies of key food items, and stable exchange rate.

Another positive for the economy, as mentioned by the Report, was the surplus in the external
account during first nine months of the year, which was led by largely contained oil payments, a
modest rise in worker remittances and foreign currency loans. Hence, SBP’s reserves reached USS
16.1 billion (aggregate reserves including banks) by end-March 2016 — this amount was sufficient to
finance four months of the country’s import bill, and more than twice the short-term payments.

Fiscal indicators also witnessed broad improvement, as noted by the Report: the budget deficit
reduced to 3.4 percent of GDP in Jul-Mar FY16, from 3.8 percent in the same period last year. More
importantly, the country recorded a primary surplus during this period. Higher revenues, contained
expenses and larger surplus from provinces led to this improvement in the fiscal account.

According to the Report, besides subdued commodity prices (particularly oil) in the global market, the
policy support also played a key role in improving macro fundamentals. An expansionary monetary
policy for the last one and a half year, development focus of fiscal spending (particularly on
infrastructure projects which also encouraged construction and related activities), better energy
management, and CPEC related initiatives, are case in point.

The Report also identified low investment rate, continued weakness in exports, slowdown in
remittances, and narrow tax base despite stop-gap measures by the government to increase tax
collection as some of the key challenges for the economy, which needs to be tackled through
structural reforms so that the recent improvement in macro fundamentals can be sustained.

The full Report is available at SBP website www.sbp.org.pk.

SBP ISSUES REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO FACILITATE
BUSINESS TO CONSUMER (B2C) E-COMMERCE EXPORTS

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued regulatory framework to facilitate Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
e-Commerce exports from Pakistan. Under the new regulatory framework, the mandatory requirement
of ‘Export’ (E) form has been done away with and now an exporter can export goods up to USD 5,000/-
per consignment without the requirement of ‘E’ Form. This step will facilitate exports in small quantities
directly to the consumers. This will also help small entrepreneurs and exporters who typically export
varied goods in small quantities and find it cumbersome to fulfill the detailed requirements of E Form
that is mainly designed for bulk exports.

Lately, the global emerging trends especially in the consumer market place have seen a major shift
from traditional market place to e-commerce due to the advent of new technologies. A surge in this
trend was particularly witnessed during the global lockdown owing to COVID-19 pandemic. In line with
these trends, SBP focused on facilitating cross border trade for B2C (Business to Consumer) exports
from Pakistan, including by small entrepreneurs and exporters. This was aimed at improving
competitiveness and digital connectivity of Pakistani businesses with the global market during the
development phase of e-Commerce Policy.

It merits mentioning here that up till now, goods from Pakistan could only be exported after
certification of Electronic/ Manual Export (‘E’) Form-E by the Authorized Dealers (ADs) and subsequent
filing of Goods Declaration by the customers with Pakistan Customs. The ‘E’ Form was required for each
shipment with complete description of the goods being exported and had been designed keeping in
view the export of large quantities of homogenous goods. However, for exports of small value different
items to individuals destined for different jurisdiction, (as is the case in B2C e-commerce exports) the
existing process was not conducive.

Earlier, in 2000, SBP had issued regulatory instructions to promote B2C e-Commerce, in Foreign
Exchange Manual, with primary focus on opening of Internet Merchant Account to facilitate e-
commerce. However, with advancement in technology, these instructions needed to cater to the
current business dynamics of e-commerce and therefore required to be replaced. Accordingly, SBP
collaborated with the relevant stakeholders including business community, Pakistan Customs, Ministry
of Commerce, courier companies and banking industry in a bid to develop a regulatory framework,
which not only addresses the market needs but also takes into account regulatory objectives.

The new regulatory framework would address the pressing demand of e-commerce exporters,
including the small entrepreneurs, besides providing the much needed impetus for the recognition and
growth of e-commerce exports from Pakistan. It would also pave the way for the big corporate brands,
SMEs, and startups, to enter the global consumer markets and contribute to the exports earning of the
country. The new regulatory framework is expected to be beneficial in improving country's rating in
the Ease of Doing Business index. Moreover, this framework would also help in documenting the
exports of small shipments, which earlier could not be included in the formal exports of the country
due to absence of any such framework.

The instructions are available at: https://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2020/FEC7.htm

SBP jointly organizes seminar on Firms and Growth

 

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir, has said that there is a need to shift from an
inward oriented to an outward oriented economy that puts a greater emphasis on exports to achieve
high and sustained growth. He was addressing the audience of a day-long seminar on ‘Firms and
Growth’ organized jointly by SBP, the International Growth Center (IGC), the Consortium for
Development Policy Research (CDPR) and the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) at SBP Karachi on 13°
January, 2020.

Giving his introductory remarks in the first session of the seminar, the Governor illustrated in his
presentation the inward oriented focus of Pakistan’s historical economic growth that has relied
primarily on domestic consumption. He elaborated that Pakistan’s comparator countries have relied to
a larger extent than Pakistan on exports as an engine of growth. He noted that the top 25 percent of
emerging markets and developing countries have grown at an average rate of 7 percent since 2001. To
reach this average growth rate it was critical for Pakistan to achieve significantly higher export growth.

Amongst other issues, Dr. Bagir discussed two considerations in determining the outlook for exports:
exchange rate and export diversification. On the exchange rate he noted that addressing exchange rate
overvaluation has helped to boost the country’s exports. He also noted that while the exchange rate
had done its part more fundamental growth in exports needed to come from structural reforms beyond
the exchange rate. In this context Dr. Baqir also contrasted the experience of different countries with
export diversification. Comparing the structure of Pakistan’s exports between 2004 and 2017, Dr. Baqir
noted that Pakistan’s exports had largely remain concentrated in very few sectors. Furthermore,
Pakistan’s exports began to decline starting around 2012. Citing the examples of some successful
exporting countries, he emphasised on the need to go beyond the traditional commodities of textile
and agriculture and the importance of export diversification.

Dr. Abdul Hafeez Sheikh also addressed the seminar and discussed measures being taken by the
government to improve the business environment. He also emphasised the role of export
diversification and that government was committed to work in partnership with the private sector to
address the factors which had previously constrained Pakistan’s growth. Mr. Asad Umar spoke about
the commitment of the new government to improving job creation and competitiveness, and to put an
end to the several policy biases of the government. He highlighted governments’ protection of
uncompetitive sectors over the past many years which remained detrimental to economic growth.

The morning session on “Moving from an Inward- to an Outward-looking Economy” began with
introductory remarks by Dr. ljaz Nabi (Country Director IGC; Chairperson CDPR). Dr. Ijaz Nabi stressed
the importance of improving the export strategy to ensure sustainable growth, and the role of fiscal
responsibility to avoid recurrent external account crises. After address of eminent speakers, a panel
discussion with Ehsan Malik (CEO, PBC), Annabel Gerry (Head of DFID Pakistan), and Gonzalo Varela
(Senior Trade Economist, World Bank) ensued. Overall, the session highlighted the importance of
creating an outward looking economy and the different contours of an export-oriented economic
strategy that Pakistan would have to adopt in order to remain competitive in the international market,
especially with regards to countries such as India and Bangladesh.

Relocation of a few SBP BSC departments aimed
at procedural & functional efficiency

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has already clarified that none of its department is being shifted to
Lahore. However, part of few functional departments of its subsidiary responsible to undertake
operational work is being relocated to Lahore, to meet the oversight and logistic requirements for
operational efficiency. The selection of Lahore was purely based on availability of space as none of
the other offices in particular our Islamabad Office had enough space to accommodate the
manpower so relocated. While the rationale for this relocation is explained in the following
paragraphs, it is stated that work relating to consolidation of accounts of government, federal and
provincial, districts, revenue collection and payments on behalf of the governments, as also functions
of commercial banks and other financial institutions would continue to be performed at Karachi in
addition to head office of its subsidiary, which will continue to remain fully functional from Karachi.

It may be added that SBP has two fully owned subsidiaries i.e. SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP
BSC) and National Institute of Banking & Finance (NIBAF). SBP BSC, established in 2001 under an
Ordinance is the operational arm of SBP with its Head Office in Karachi and 16 field offices established
in 15 cities. The SBP BSC caters to operational responsibilities related to currency distribution, foreign
exchange operations, and banker to the governments, as also dissemination and implementation of
policies on behalf of Development Finance Group (DFG) of SBP in the areas of Agriculture, Islamic
Banking, Housing Finance, SME and Micro Finance, alongside provision of non-core services to SBP.
The policy formulation work in these areas shall continue to be performed by SBP at Karachi.

Need for Relocation of Some Operational Departments:

SBP BSC is headed by a Managing Director (MD) who has a large team of Directors and Chief
Managers, directly reporting to him. In order to create efficiency in oversight function, improve
operational efficiency and bring about synergy in functions, some modifications were carried out in
the Organization Structure of SBP BSC, with the approval of its Board of Directors. The departments
of BSC at Karachi were placed in 3 Groups whereas its 16 Field Offices were clubbed into 3 Regions
ie. i) South, ii) Central and iii) North Regions. South region comprises Karachi, North Nazimabad,
Hyderabad, Sukkur and Quetta Offices. North region includes Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, D.I.
Khan and Muzaffarabad Offices. The Central region includes Lahore, Bahawalpur, Sialkot, Gujranwala,
Multan, Faisalabad Offices. It would be important to note that 11 out of 16 field offices are located in
Central and North Regions, which share 60% of our workload, engage 62% of our HR and provide
coverage to 2/3rd of NBP Chests. Majority of chest branches of the National Bank and the branches of
the commercial banks are also functioning in these regions.

As a part of efforts to improve functions relating to distribution of currency besides and enhance
capacity to ensure that the banking sector is not used as a tool to circulate counterfeit and soiled
notes, SBP has been making efforts to automate the currency management function both at SBP BSC
as also the banking Sector. SBP BSC as a part of SBP currency management strategy has already
embarked upon installation of different types of Bank Note authenticating machines at field offices.
In addition, it has also procured and installed High Speed Bank Note Authentication and Processing

SBP clarifies financing gap numbers

This is to clarify that the estimate of financing gap for FY18, attributed to Governor SBP, appearing in
today’s newspapers is misconstrued. It appears that the numbers have been confused with the gross
external financing requirements of the country.

Financing gap is the difference between country’s estimated gross financing need and available
financing. SBP’s current estimates suggest that during FY18 the financing gap is likely to be around $2.5
billion, and NOT $ 12 billion as reported in the press.

Furthermore, it may be highlighted that the Government and SBP have recently taken several measures
to contain the financing gap. These include: (i) imposition of regulatory duties on non-essential imports
(ii) provision of un-interrupted energy to the export-oriented industries (iii) the export package worth
Rs180 billion and, (iv) introduction of Asaan Remittance Account to support the inflow of worker
remittances through official channels. These measures, together with the recent market-driven
adjustment in the exchange rate would help in narrowing the current account deficit, thereby reducing
the gross financing need.

PM Launches Raast: Pakistan’s Instant Payment System — an initiative of SBP
The Honorable Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Imran Khan, launched the completion of the first phase
of Pakistan’s Instant Payment System, Raast, in a ceremony held in Islamabad today and hosted by the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Raast is an initiative of SBP under which it has developed Pakistan’s first
instant payment system in collaboration with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Karandaaz, Pakistan.
Raast is an accomplishment of one of the milestones of SBP’s broader strategic agenda of digitalization
and increasing financial inclusion in the country.
Speaking at the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated SBP and termed the launch of Raast as an
important step towards fulfilling the Government’s vision and commitment to effectively promote and
encourage digitalization of the economy. Raast will provide digital, easy-to-use, efficient and cost-
effective payment options to people of Pakistan and expected to be a catalyst for providing sustainable
opportunities to small businesses and individuals. The Prime Minister showed optimism that Raast will
help government resolve current inefficiencies in various types of payments such as salary and pension
and further improve disbursements under Ehsaas Program and BISPs, amongst other areas.
In his welcoming remarks, Dr. Reza Baqir informed that the Central Bank has been encouraging
technological innovations in banking and payment systems for a long time; however, following the
vision of the PM and his support it has stepped up its efforts further to accelerate the pace of
digitalization in the country. To modernize country’s banking and payment systems, SBP has taken
various initiatives such as enabling Fintechs, and modernizing payments’ infrastructure.
Referring to the National Payments Strategy prepared with the help of World Bank and announced in
November 2019, Governor Bagir remarked that Raast is the first major step taken to implement the
strategy. He highlighted that SBP initiated the project Raast, with the support of Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and Karandaaz Pakistan, after a thorough review of ground realities about prevailing
payment habits and in line with international best practices and standards. The state-of-the-art faster
payment system will provide a cheap and universal access to people of Pakistan especially those who
are financially excluded and less privileged like women.
Dr Baqir told the gathering that the faster payment system will help spur economic growth especially
by facilitating small businesses and individuals. He shared SBP’s plan to launch the system in a phased
manner, starting with bulk payment module which will include digitization of dividend payments,
salaries, pensions and other payments of government departments. In next phases, Raast will digitize
payments of micro and small business owners or merchants, who can then pay suppliers on time and
fulfill other urgent payment obligations. Similarly, the system will provide seamless Person-to-Person
payments that will include features such as sending requests for payments and initiating payments
using identifiers such as phone numbers or any other alias.
The UN Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA), H.M
Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, also graced the occasion and shared her thoughts. The Special
Advocate has supported promoting financial inclusion in Pakistan over the years, including
country visits in 2016 and 2019. Pakistan launched its first national financial inclusion strategy
(NFIS) shortly before the UNSGSA’s first visit. During her UN country visit in November 2019,
the UNSGSA delivered a speech at a ceremony to establish the micropayments gateway now
being launched as Raast — Pakistan’s Instant Payment System.

Dr Akhtar tells banks to expedite
repatriation of export proceeds

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today advised all
commercial banks to ensure repatriation of overdue export proceeds.

Addressing a meeting of heads of commercial banks held at State Bank of
Pakistan, Karachi, Dr Akhtar expressed concern over inability of banks to realize export
proceeds within the stipulated period of 180 days.

She recommended that banks should concentrate on encouraging exporters to
bring back over-due export proceeds, which are held-up for less than a year. “Banks
have to really act fast to ensure realization of approximately $200 - $220 million
overdue proceeds on which the State Bank staff will be working closely with them.”

SBP Governor underscored the need to devise a mechanism to segregate
between those exporters who have genuine problems and those who are not bringing
back export proceeds willfully. The State Bank and banks are to conduct analysis of
reasons for delays in export proceeds beyond one year and work out linkage between
held up export proceeds and Export Refinance. She also said that banks and the State
Bank should also develop a database of export proceeds region wise/customer wise in
order to expedite repatriation of the held up proceeds.

Representatives of the commercial banks assured the central bank that they will
make utmost efforts towards realization of export proceeds. They also agreed to have
another meeting with the Governor SBP after 15 days to report the progress in this

regard.

SBP extends the availability of Deferment of Principal
Amount of Loans facility till September 2020

Considering the fact that COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to stress the cash flow of small and
medium sized businesses and households, SBP has decided to extend the Deferment of
Principal Amount facility up till 30° September 2020. This facility will however be available for
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing, Consumer Financing, Housing Finance, Agriculture
Finance and Micro financing only. The facility is not being extended to corporates and
commercial borrowers since a significant amount of their loans and advances has already been
deferred. It is expected that more businesses and households, who were not able to avail the
facility, will benefit from this extension.

On March 26"" 2020, amid growing concerns about the potential economic impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) with the collaboration of Pakistan Banks Association (PBA)
announced a comprehensive set of measures to help businesses and households to manage their
finances. Among these, a key measure was the deferment of principal amount of loans and advances
by banks and DFls. Under this facility, businesses and households could request for the deferment of
their loans and advances for a period of one year, albeit continuing to service the mark-up amount. The
measure also ensured that the deferment of principal will not affect borrower’s credit history and such
facilities will not be reported as restructured/rescheduled in the credit bureau’s data. This measure
proved extremely helpful for borrowers and is evident from the fact that up till 3 July 2020, banks
deferred Rs. 593 billion of principal amount of loans of over 359 thousand borrowers. A very large
number of borrowers— 95 percent of total beneficiaries of this scheme, as of July 3, 2020 have been
small borrowers including SMEs, consumer finance, and microfinance.

HM Queen Maxima shares wisdom for enhancing Digital Financial Inclusion in
Round Table organized by State Bank

 

Islamabad, Wednesday February 10, 2016: Her Majesty Queen Maxima of Netherlands, UN
Secretary-General’s Special Advocate on Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA) chaired a
round table discussion on “Future of Digital Financial Services” in Islamabad. The Queen Maxima is
visiting Pakistan in her efforts to promote financial inclusion. The Round Table was organized by State
Bank of Pakistan.

HE Queen said that Pakistan has one of the best regulatory frameworks which provide strong
foundations for taking financial inclusion to its next level. She emphasized that the industry should
collaborate to remove at least some of the key bottlenecks over the next three to four quarters to
realize the potential of Digital Financial Services. Discouraging use of excess cash, availability of smart
cell phone for the women and rationalizing cost of branchless banking services were some of the
suggestion made by H.M. Queen. Sharing international experiences, she mentioned that
interoperability should be viewed as a public good.

Before start of the detailed discussion, Governor SBP Ashraf Wathra, while giving his welcome
remarks said that Digital Financial Services (DFS) has the potential to overcome the hurdles posed by
the conventional business models. He pointed out that branchless banking is both convenient and
affordable for underserved demographics in a highly cost-efficient manner. Governor Wathra shared
that enabling regulatory environment has helped create the digital financial landscape in the country.
“Industry infrastructure has evolved as a key alternate delivery channel, advancing itself continuously
to every nook and corner of the country”, said the Governor. While giving an overview of state of
affairs of the branchless banking industry in the country, he pointed out that Digital Financial Services
channel is largely used by low income persons.

Round table discussants drilled down the key challenges and highlighted the need for bringing down
the cost, increasing public trust and confidence in DFS through awareness and a need for learning
from international practices.

Concluding the roundtable discussions, Deputy Governor Saeed Ahmad stressed upon the industry
players to collaborate more for integrated solutions to remove the bottlenecks. He emphasized the
role of other important stakeholders such as SECP and PTA in promotion of M-wallets accounts and
other important areas which are essential in the promotion of Financial Inclusion and providing
inclusive and sustainable services to poor segment of the society.

The roundtable was attended by chairman of PTA Syed Ismail Shah, Ambassador of Netherland,
senior representatives of regulatory bodies, NADRA, Telcos, Financial Institutions, Technology
Services Provides, Donors and Multilateral Agencies.

SBP is all setto launch consultation on Banking on Equality policy for reducing the gender gap in
financial inclusion

Women’s access to financial and economic opportunities is essential for sustainable and inclusive
economic growth. However, women in Pakistan are disproportionately under-served by the financial
system. Only 18% percent of adult women in Pakistan have an active bank account comparedwith 51%
men. In order to address the gender disparities, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has adopted a medium-
term national target of 20 million active women bank accounts by 2023 under National Financial
Inclusion Strategy. The target will be achieved through the launch of a policy to reduce the gender gap
in financial inclusion, titled Banking on Equality, which aims to promote women financial inclusion in
Pakistan.

“Banking on Equality: Reducing the Gender Gap in Financial Inclusion”, is a flagship policy initiative of
State Bank of Pakistan for promoting women financial inclusion. The policy willintroduce a gender lens
within the financial sector through specific measures to bring a shift towards gender friendly business
practices.

To initiate a national dialogue on women financial inclusion, SBP has organized a webinar titled

international thought leaders to discuss practical ways to give a boost to women financial inclusionin
Pakistan.

 

SBP Governor, Dr. Reza Baqir will host the consultative launch of the Banking on Equality policy with
introductory presentation on the policy by SBP Deputy Governor Ms. Sima Kamil, and followed by a
high level panel discussion around women’s financial inclusion. The panel members would include
Princess Zahra Aga Khan Director Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), Ms. Ceyla Pazarbasioglu
from IMF and Dr. Reza Baqir Governor, State Bank of Pakistan while Dr. Anita Zaidi from Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (BMGF) will moderate the panel discussion.

Karachi, Sept. 12: Twenty days are left for exchanging old design & bigger size banknote of
Rs 500 denomination from the field offices of SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) and branches
of all banks.

The State Bank of Pakistan and SBP BSC will neither exchange nor be liable to pay any value of
such banknote to any person or a bank after October 1, 2012.

SBP has, therefore, once again advised the general public to exchange old design and bigger size
banknote of Rs 500 from the field offices of SBP BSC and over 10,000 branches of banks across the
country till the close of banking hours on October 01, 2012.

It may be recalled that Rs 500 old design and bigger size banknote had already been

State Bank to launch Special Pilot Project to
improve access of agri credit on fast track: Salim Raza

The State Bank of Pakistan is launching a Special Pilot Project in Sindh from the
current kharif season to improve the availability of agricultural credit to the farmers
on fast track basis.

Disclosing this while presiding over the mid-term review meeting of the
Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) at SBP, Karachi today, the State Bank
Governor, Syed Salim Raza said that the Pilot Project will initially be launched in seven
agri. intensive districts of Sindh including Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas,
Larkana, Sanghar, Nawabshah & Khairpur. He said that the project which is being
launched from 15‘ March will be participated by 13 different banks having agri.
designated branches in these districts. He said that SBP’s Pilot Project will help to
increase outreach of agri. credit to underserved areas of Sindh and added that the
banks are meeting 47 percent of the total credit requirement of farmers. The rest is
being met through informal resources.

He said that during July-January 2008-09, commercial banks have disbursed Rs
117 billion, against the full-year target of Rs 250 billion. The disbursement is higher by
Rs 12 billion than the disbursements of Rs 105 billion in the same period last year. He
said that major chunk of the credit i.e. Rs 81 billion or 70 percent was availed by farm
sector mainly for production purposes whereas share of non-farm sector has also
increased by Rs 8 billion during the period under review.

Salim Raza said that share of subsistence holding farmers (small farmers) in agri.
loans disbursement has increased to Rs 51 billion or 64 percent from Rs 46 billion or
60 percent during July 2008 to January 2009. Similarly, for economic holding farmers
the share has risen to 18 billion or 23 percent from Rs 17 billion or 22 percent
whereas the share of above economic holding farmers reduced to Rs 11 billion or 14
percent from Rs 14 billion or 18 percent.

He also informed the participants that non-performing loans of agri. loans have
declined to 17 percent in Dec. 2008 from 20 percent in Dec. 2007 as a result of
improved overall recovery rate of 76 percent in Dec. 2008 from 71 percent in Dec.
2007.

Regretting the trend of uneven geographical distribution in agri. credit
disbursements, the SBP Governor urged upon the commercial banks and other

SBP categorically rejects allegations of involvement in money launderin

 

Apropos the statements made by member National Assembly, Mr. Asad Umar, during a meeting of
the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and
Privatization, it is unfortunate that allegations of involvement of State Bank of Pakistan in money
laundering have been made. It was also alleged by Mr. Umar that SBP has not provided information
for the last four months regarding investments made by Pakistanis in Dubai properties.

SBP, categorically, rejects such allegations of its involvement in money laundering and clarifies that
there is no request for information pending with it.

In this context, it is clarified that on December 19, 2016, SBP received a set of questions from the
Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization, National
Assembly Secretariat regarding advertisements published in Pakistani newspapers inviting people to
invest in property in Dubai etc. Some of these questions pertained to SBP while rest fall in the domain
of other Government agencies. On January 03, 2017, SBP responded through Finance Division while
answering the questions relevant to SBP. Previously, SBP had also provided its views on issues
related to buying of properties in Dubai raised by the same MNA in NA committee meeting.

SBP reiterates that it always stands ready to share any information with the august parliament within
the domain of law.

State Bank issues revised instructions regarding imports made on open account basis

In order to facilitate international trade, the State Bank has dispensed with the requirement of
submission of original shipping/transport documents to the Authorized Dealers by the importers for
payments against imports made on open account basis.

Earlier, importers were, interalia, required to present original shipping/transport documents to
Authorized Dealers for effecting the related import payments.

The initiative has been taken in the wake of requests from different stakeholders including various
chambers of commerce, importers, banks etc. as international trade is witnessing shift from physical
transfer of original transport documents to electronically transmitted transport documents, Telex
Release etc. to save cost and time involved in physical transfer of such documents from foreign seller
to the importer. Further, implementation of Electronic Import Form (EIF) by the State Bank and
Pakistan Customs has strengthened the monitoring of imports into Pakistan and related payments,

thus, the possibility of multiple payments against single import consignment through different banks
stands eliminated.

It would not only provide facilitation to importers but would equally be beneficial for the exporters
who import inputs/raw materials for manufacturing of exportable goods/products.

Banks Advised to Specifically Focus on Training and Development of their Employees

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued “Guidelines for Training and Development of
Bank Employees.” The guidelines primarily aim to provide continuous learning
atmosphere to bank employees.

The guidelines advised banks to prepare a comprehensive training and development
policy duly approved by their Board of Directors for all major functional areas, which
should interalia cover processes related to Training Needs Assessment (TNA) and
selection of employees for a specific training program.

Appropriately trained and knowledgeable employees are the most valuable asset for a
bank to attain good governance and competitive advantage in the market. Banks,
therefore, require to pay due attention to the training and development needs of
their employees. The ever changing banking environment coupled with technological
advancements further put stress on the importance of improved skills, capabilities
and knowledge of a bank employee. Banks can transform their human resource into
human capital by providing proper training and development opportunities to their
employees on a regular basis.

The guidelines further elaborate that training and development budget of banks
should specifically be made part of an overall budget document to be discussed and
approved by the Board of Directors on annual basis. Further, the training and
development budget may ideally be linked with overall size and complexity of
operations of a bank or with certain percentage of administrative expenses.

SBP suggested that Human Resources Committee of the Board should be assigned
the responsibility of monitoring the utilization of training and development budget
and implementation of approved training & development policy.It has also been
advised that bank should focus on training of employees posted at remote / rural
area branches so that they may also get appropriate number of trainings during a
year.

Banks are required to implement these guidelines by December 31, 2016 after which
SBP will assess their compliance during the course of on-site inspections of banks.

State Bank’s Fresh Currency Notes Service 8877 Receives
Overwhelming Public Response

In order to meet the public demand for fresh currency notes on the occasion of Eid ul Fitr 2016, the
State Bank of Pakistan Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) re-launched the SMS Short Code based
service (8877) for issuance of fresh currency notes on the occasion of this Ramzan as well i.e., from
2"" Ramzan, 2016.

The service has been made available through a network of 500 e-branches of banks in 116 cities and
16 field offices of SBP BSC across Pakistan.

SBP is pleased to inform the general public that so far around 1.3 million individuals have obtained
booking code out of which around 55% have received fresh cash from the above branches against
surrender of exchange value. This service has once again attracted overwhelming response of the
general public. Consequently, a number of e-branches touched their maximum booking limit well
before expectations. However, to accommodate more people, the maximum limit for those e-
branches has been revised upward.

To ensure that members of public who have already obtained booking code are able to redeem fresh
cash during the remaining working days before Eid ul Fitr, 2016, the booking service is being closed as
from Saturday, June 25, 2016 at mid-night and as such no booking code will be issued thereafter.
Member of general public are requested to refrain from texting messages to 8877. SBP and SBP BSC
acknowledge the role of commercial banks and general public in making this initiative successful in
116 cities across the country.

Acting Governor SBP witnesses inking share subscription agreement
of Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company

""House financing to GDP ratio in Pakistan is currently less than 1%. This is one of the lowest in the
world. Unless we effectively promote house financing by using our existing financial institutions and
also create enabling environment for specialised housing finance institutions, the dire shortage of
housing will continue with its negative social consequences. ""

These were the sentiments expressed by Saeed Ahmad, the Acting Governor, SBP while he witnessed
inking share subscription agreement of Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company. “By inking share
subscription agreement of Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC), we are witnessing today a
historical milestone on the path towards promotion of Mortgage Finance in Pakistan”, he said.

Agreement was signed by representatives of Ministry of Finance and banks/DFI. Presidents/CEOs of
the equity holding institutions also witnessed the signing ceremony. While highlighting growing
demand of housing units in Pakistan in the backdrop of rapidly growing population and escalated real
estate prices, Saeed Ahmad said that two key impediments in housing finance i.e non-availability of
long term liquidity and issue of foreclosure laws have now been addressed and urged CEOs of the
banks to contribute positively towards meeting unmet demand of low cost and affordable housing in
the country. He referred to a World Bank report in terms of which there was an estimated backlog of
7.5 million housing units in 2009 which is increasing by 300,000 units annually.

He further said that apart from being the biggest asset of a common person, housing plays an
important role in the long term economic development. More than 40 industries and 70 percent of
the unskilled labor force are attached with the housing and construction sectors. Keeping in view the
socio-economic benefits of housing and construction sectors, SBP has undertaken housing finance as
a priority lending area. He acknowledged support provided by the Government in setting up PMRC
which can act as a conduit to efficiently connecting long-term investors with Primary Mortgage
Lenders generating long-term assets in Pakistan, thus helping develop a debt market and a longer
term yield curve. Banks lauded the efforts made by SBP and GoP in conversion of concept into long-
awaited reality.

Signing ceremony was attended by the representatives of Ministry of Finance and Presidents/CEOs of
NBP, HBL, UBL, ABL, Bank-Alfalah, Bank Al-Habib, Askari Bank, Summit Bank and HBFCL. Senior
officials of SBP, BOD of PMRC and a representative of IFC also participated in the event.

The role played by the SBP team including Samar Hasnain, ED and GM Abbasi, Director, Acting CEO of
PMRC Mr Hasni together with other directors was appreciated by banks' Heads. Mr. Nouman Dar CEO
of HBL, Mr. Wajahat Husain CEO of UBL and Mr. Atif Bajwa CEO of Alfalah showed their keen interest
in the house finance sector and thanked State Bank for providing enabling environment for banks to
participate in this important segment of the economy.

SBP extends the Rozgar Scheme for Supporting Employment for another 3 months and
widens its scope in collaboration with Government of Pakistan

Soon after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, SBP took a number of steps to provide
economic support to businesses and households. SBP reduced the financial cost to the private
and public businesses and households by reducing the policy rate by a cumulative 625 basis
points since 17° March 2020. To improve the cash flow of businesses and households, it
allowed deferment of principal amount and restructuring of loans. In addition to these
measures, SBP introduced several refinance schemes to support employment and investment
to fight the economic impact of COVID-19.

SBP has decided to extend the Rozgar scheme for another three months and, in collaboration
with the Government of Pakistan, has increased the risk coverage for SMEs under the
scheme. For details see our SBP circulars available at:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL14.htm and

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL15.htm

Specifically, following changes have been made:

1. Refinance Scheme to Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers, commonly
known as SBP Rozgar scheme: This scheme provides concessional loans to businesses for
wages and salaries expenses provided they commit not lay off their employees for the
period of the loan. SBP has decided to extend the validity of this scheme by another 3
months to end September, 2020. Businesses will now be able to obtain financing to pay
wages and salaries for a maximum period of 6 months starting April 2020 till September
2020. Effectively, this suggests that not only businesses can obtain loans to fund their
wages and salaries bill up to a period of 3 months from July till September 2020, but can
also get reimbursement for the wages and salaries paid during April-June 2020. For those
who have already availed financing under the scheme, financing limits for the months of
July to September 2020 will be calculated on the same basis on which limits were
calculated for the months of April to June 2020. Under the scheme, up till 19"" June 2020,
financing of Rs 112.8 billion have been approved by banks for 1653 businesses covering
wages and salaries of over 1.1 million employees.

2. GoP Risk Sharing Facility under SBP Rozgar Scheme: With a view to incentivize banks/DFls for
financing to SMEs and non SME corporates, Government of Pakistan (GoP) introduced a Risk
Sharing Facility (RSF) for SBP’s Rozgar Scheme. Under this facility, GoP bears 40% first loss on
disbursed portfolio (principal portion only) for eligible borrowers. Government of Pakistan has
now decided not only to extend validity of its risk sharing facility (RSF) for another three
months for SMEs and small corporates with turnover of up to Rs 2 billion but also enhanced

SBP GOVERNOR DR. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR’S PRESS STATEMENT

 

The following is the text of the statement of the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr.
Shamshad Akhtar, issued to the press tonight:

“SBP has been monitoring closely the recent developments regarding the overall and bank specific
liquidity position. After a measured assessment, SBP has decided to take the following action to
ease the liquidity situation of the market:

e Reduction in the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for all deposits up to one year maturity by
100bps to 8.00 percent w.e.f. from 11% October 2008 and by another 100bps to 7.00
percent w.e.f. 15t? November 2008. As a result of this cumulative decrease of 200bps, Rs61
billion will be released into the system. The liquidity situation will be monitored on a
continuous basis and the change in the CRR may be reviewed accordingly.

It must be remembered that this is a temporary measure aimed at accommodating extraordinary
liquidity requirements of the banking system and, therefore, should not be construed as a change in
the monetary policy stance. Active and calibrated liquidity management is a part of a prudent
monetary policy management necessary to achieve financial as well as overall macroeconomic
stability. The SBP’s assessment of risks to inflation outweighing the risks to growth still holds and
therefore it remains committed to check the snowball impact on inflation expectations of persistently
high fiscal and external current account deficit and overall aggregate demand pressures in order to
achieve price stability over the medium term.

As a result of global financial crises central banks across the globe have now further stepped up
their interventions in the financial markets to shore up confidence and to ease the liquidity situation.
However the domestic macroeconomic situation differs across countries and_ regions.
Macroeconomic stability in Pakistan continues to be under stress on account of both domestic and
external vulnerabilities. The fiscal stress continues to be high. After registering an all time record
borrowings of Rs689 billion from the SBP in FYO8, the Government borrowings have continued to
rise unabated in FYO9 also. This excessive recourse on the banking system borrowings is straining
the credit availability for the private sector and is also causing complications for effective liquidity
management. The weaknesses in the external sector, in particular, constitute a major source of
concern at the moment. Despite strong inflow of workers’ remittances and a decent export
performance the external current account deficit remained at an unsustainable level of 8.4 percent
of GDP in FYO8. With considerable slowdown in private as well as public financial inflows, the
financing gap has widened and consequent outflow of foreign exchange has drained the rupee
liquidity from the system straining the domestic money market; the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the
banking system have depleted by Rs166.5 billion during 1st July- 20"" September FYO9.

Financial system of Pakistan remains sound and stable,
says Financial Stability Review of SBP

The financial system of Pakistan remains in a sound and stable state at the end of CY15, said the
Financial Stability Review (FSR), released by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today.

The FSR — which highlights the performance of the financial sector during CY15 and identifies key risks
(both idiosyncratic and systemic) states that the asset base of the overall financial sector has
increased at a decent pace of 15.1 percent during CY15 (12.6 percent, on average, during CY13-15).
Consequently, the financial depth has improved as “financial assets to GDP” ratio has increased to
68.4 percent in CY15 from 59.4 percent in CY14 and 56.4 percent in CY13.

As reported, the financial sector of Pakistan has flourished despite challenges on the global front. The
domestic economic environment, in fact, counter balanced the global economy repercussions as the
economy has shown signs of improvements viz; inflation is low, foreign exchange reserves are
building up and exchange rate is stable, large scale manufacturing has picked up some pace along
with credit to private sector and fiscal consolidation continues.

In terms of the review, performance of the banking sector, with major share in the financial sector,
improved on the back of record earnings and high capital adequacy ratio, which has enhanced the
overall resilience of the sector. Strong assets growth and revival of private sector credit, along with
gradual improvement in the asset quality further strengthened the overall financial position of the
banking sector. The banking sector observed YoY growth of 16.8 percent in CY15 (average growth of
13.2 percent during CY13-CY15) to reach PKR 14.1 trillion as of end December, 2015. During the same
period, advances grew at a modest pace of average 8.1 percent (average 8.7 percent during CY13-
CY15); while Investments — mostly in government securities — increased by 30 percent (average 20.1
percent during CY13-CY15). The asset expansion has mainly been financed by deposits growth of 12.6
percent (average 12.5 percent during CY13-CY15) followed by financial borrowings.

Asset quality improved with reduction in infection ratio (11.4 percent in CY15 compared to 13.3
percent in CY13) and rise in provision coverage (84.9 percent in CY15 compared to 77.1 percent in
CY13). However, banks do face challenge in reducing the high stock on NPLs. To this end, SBP is
working on various legal and regulatory measures.

The operating performance observed considerable improvement as banking sector posted record
after tax profit of PKR 199 billion during CY15, largely contributed by growing income share from
investment in government papers. As a result, profitability indicators have improved; ROA (after tax)
increased to 1.5 percent in CY15 from 1.1 percent in CY13 and ROE (after tax) increased to 15.6
percent from 12.4 percent in CY13. The solvency has also remained robust with high Capital
Adequacy Ratio at 17.4 percent in CY15 (14.9 percent in CY13). Islamic banking increased its share in
overall assets to 11.4 percent in CY15 ( 9.6 percent in CY13) in line with the Strategic Plan for the
Islamic Banking Industry 2014-2018. While banks are maintaining high capital levels, expected growth
in credit and gradual enhancement in minimum capital requirements prescribed by the regulators
require banks to shore up their efforts for further strengthening their capital.

SBP grants record number of
730 branch licenses in 2008

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued 730 licenses to commercial banks to
open new branches/sub-branches in calendar year 2008 under its Branch Licensing
Policy (BLP). This is the highest ever number of licenses given by the State Bank in any
year.

In 2007, the State Bank issued a total of 474 branch licenses. As of Dec. 16,
2008 the total number of bank branches operating in the country was 8,886. It may be
mentioned that under BLP, commercial banks which want to open new places of
business during a calendar year are required to submit their Annual Branch Expansion
Plan (ABEP) to the State Bank for consideration and approval. Accordingly, various
banks submitted their ABEP-2008 and were granted approval for opening of branches.

As required under the BLP, banks are required to open at least 20% of their
branches in rural/under-served areas (RUAs). RUAs mean villages, small towns and
also include those Tehsil Headquarters where there is no branch of any bank.

Accordingly, in 2008 a total of 144 branch licenses have been issued for
opening branches in RUAs that exceeds the mandatory requirement of opening of
20%. The locations identified by banks for opening of new branches are well
diversified throughout the country covering all the four provinces of Pakistan,
Northern Areas, Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Islamabad.

In addition, a total of 178 licenses for opening of sub-branches have been
granted in 2008 while 408 licenses were granted to open up branches in urban areas.
A total of 30 banks were granted permission by the State Bank to open new
branches/sub-branches in 2008. Highest number of 66 licenses were granted to
Banklslami, followed by Meezan Bank 61 and 55 each to Askari Bank and United Bank
Ltd. Other prominent banks which were given branch/sub-branch licenses in 2008
include Bank Al Falah 51, Bank Al Habib 50, KASB Bank 38, Emirates Global Islamic
Bank 30, MCB Bank 30, JS Bank 30, Soneri Bank 28, Faysal Bank 25, Arif Habib Bank 21,
My Bank 20, National Bank 19, Habib Bank 18, Kashf Microfinance Bank 18, Dawood
Islamic Bank 16, Atlas Bank 15, Allied Bank 14, AlBaraka Islamic Bank 12, Habib
Metropolitan Bank 10, The First Microfinance Bank 10 and miscellaneous 38.

It may be pointed out that branch network of Islamic banking institutions also
crossed an important milestone of 500 branches in December 2008. The total branch
network of Islamic banking institutions now consists of 506 branches including 70 sub-
branches. In December 2007, total branches of Islamic banking institutions were 289
and during this year 217 new outlets have been opened by Islamic banking
institutions. This impressive growth is a proof of resilience of Islamic banking industry
in Pakistan, which would be helpful in achieving the cherished target of 12% market
share by Islamic banking till 2012 as envisaged in Strategic Plan announced by the
State Bank.

State Bank to Further Facilitate Freelancers

In order to broaden the scope of business-to-customer transactions through home
remittance channel, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced payment limits against
freelance services in computer and information systems and other freelance services from
USS 5,000 per individual per month to USS 25,000 per individual per month.

The enhancement in limit will facilitate freelancers to route greater value of funds through
a more economical and efficient channel of home remittances and help in receiving foreign
exchange flows through formal banking channels in the country.

This would also enable freelancers to expand their business/ operations and engage new
freelancers to join the workforce. This is expected to create employment opportunities and
increase foreign exchange earnings of the country.

While Export of Services has been growing in double digits, (10.5% rise registered in January,
2020), this enhancement of limits for freelancers shall further accelerate growth in Export
of Services in the months ahead.

SBP issues separate housing finance prudential regulations to lay more focus on housing finance

 

SBP has been extending its endeavors to enhance the priority sector lending i.e. Agriculture Credit,
Micro Financing, SME Financing, House Financing, Infrastructure Financing and Exports. Keeping in
view the importance of these sectors, SBP has been creating enabling regulatory environment
through conducive Prudential Regulations (PRs) and market development through positive policy
measures i.e. issuance of guidelines, setting indicative targets, promoting capacity building of
financial institutions etc. These activities have been undertaken at SBP as “Special Initiatives” by the

Deputy Governor, Mr. Saeed Ahmad.

Housing and construction plays an important role in an economy. Around 50 industries and 70
percent of the unskilled labour are associated with construction sector. Housing Finance
supplements radically in long term economic growth via job creation, economic linkages and in

raising living standards of people.

The Housing Finance in Pakistan is relatively very low as compared to our neighbouring countries
and has not been growing at a desired pace. Outreach of Housing Finance in terms of income
groups and geography is very limited. The State Bank of Pakistan has been taking various steps for
promotion and development of this sector. Prudential Regulations relating to Housing Finance
needed to be revised to bring them in line with current needs. Keeping in view specific features of
Housing Finance i.e. tenure, pricing, and collateral arrangements being different from other areas of
consumer financing products, a separate set of Prudential Regulations specifically for Housing

Finance has been issued to give true focus to this area.

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
July 16, 2019

1. At its meeting on 16th July 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate
by 100 bps to 13.25 percent with effect from 17th July 2019. The decision takes into account upside
inflationary pressures from exchange rate depreciation since the last MPC meeting on 20th May 2019 and the
likely increase in near term inflation from the one-off impact of recent adjustments in utility prices and other
measures in the FY20 budget. The decision also takes into account downside inflation pressures from
softening demand indicators. Taking these factors into consideration, the MPC expects average inflation of
11 — 12 percent in FY20, higher than previously projected. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to fall
considerably in FY21 as the one-off effect of some of the causes of the recent rise in inflation diminishes.

2. With this decision on interest rates, the MPC is of the view that the adjustment related to interest rates
and the exchange rate from previously accumulated imbalances has taken place. Going forward the MPC will
be ready to take action depending on economic developments and data outturns. Unanticipated increases in
inflation that adversely affect the inflation outlook may lead to further modest tightening. On the other hand,
a greater than expected softening in domestic demand and downward revision in projected inflation would
provide grounds for easing monetary conditions.

3. In reaching this decision the MPC considered the key economic developments since the last MPC
meeting on 20th May 2019, developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for
monetaty conditions and inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC

4. There have been three key developments since the last MPC meeting. First, the Government of Pakistan
has passed a FY20 budget that seeks to credibly improve fiscal sustainability by focusing on revenue measures
to widen the tax base. Adjustments in utility prices and other measures in the budget are expected to lead to a
one-time considerable increase in prices in the first half of FY20. On the other hand, the government has also
committed to cease borrowing from the State Bank that would qualitatively improve the inflation outlook.
Second, the outlook for external financing has further strengthened with the disbursement of the first tranche
associated with the IMF Extended Fund Facility, activation of the Saudi oil facility, and other commitments
of support from multilateral and bilateral partners. The current account deficit has also continued to fall
suggesting that external pressures continue to decline. On the other hand, the depreciation in the exchange
rate since the last MPC has added to inflationary pressures. Finally, on the international front, the sentiment
towards emerging markets has improved with greater expectations of a policy rate cut in the United States.

Real sector

5. Domestic demand is estimated to moderate to about 3 percent in FY19 and GDP growth to 3.3 percent.
While current high frequency indicators point to a slowing in economic activity, this is expected to turn
around in the course of the year on the back of improved market sentiments in the context of IMF supported
program, a rebound in the agriculture sector and the gradual impact of government incentives for export-
oriented industries. Conditional upon the latest available information, SBP expect the real GDP growth of
around 3.5 percent in FY20.

External sector
6. External conditions show continued steady improvement with a sizeable reduction in the current account

deficit which fell by 29.3 percent to US$ 12.7 billion in Jul-May FY19 as compared to US$ 17.9 billion during
the same period last year. This improvement was primarily driven by import compression and healthy growth

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

We have, in a difficult year, seen steady improvement in key indicators following continued
implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program. CPI inflation continues to fall,
government borrowing from the central bank remains within quarterly limits, and SBP’s foreign
exchange reserves have increased. These positives, in turn, reflect contraction in aggregate
demand, much-needed fiscal consolidation, and an improved balance of payments position.
Consistent with the gradual strengthening of macro fundamentals, the inter-bank money market
is functioning smoothly, the foreign exchange market has been stable within a tight range, and
deposit growth in the banking system is picking up.

However, these positive developments are not without costs. Exacerbated by electricity
shortages and security issues, real GDP growth has fallen to 2.0 percent in FYO9, down from 4.1
percent a year earlier. Large-scale manufacturing activity has already seen a record run of
eleven consecutive months decline up to May 2009. Further there has been no growth in credit
to the private sector. Given the various structural constraints faced by the country in economic
and security spheres recovery could be slow and sporadic.

While solutions for structural impediments develop in the backdrop, monetary policy will
maintain its oversight of inflation and its role in improving macroeconomic imbalances,
simultaneously supporting real economic activity. A 7.9 percentage point decline in CPI inflation
(YoY), from 19.1 percent in March ‘09 to 11.2 percent in July, is reassuring and validates the
direction of economic policy. The YoY non-food non-energy (NFNE) and 20-percent trimmed
measures of core inflation have also declined to 14.0 and 13.9 percent in July. In fact, the pace
of decline in inflation increased noticeably in Q4-FY09, compared to the previous quarter, and
continued through into the first month of FY10.

The external current account deficit contracted to $8.9 billion (5.3 percent of GDP) and SBP’s
foreign exchange reserve position strengthened to $9.1 billion by the end of June ‘09. As of 13th
August, ‘09 SBP’s foreign exchange reserves stand at $9.4 billion. With continuing global
recession and slowdown in domestic economic activity, both exports and imports have declined
by 5.9 and 10.5 percent in FYO9. Exports may improve slightly if global recovery sets in by the
beginning of 2010, as many anticipate. Similarly, imports could pick up also assuming domestic
economic recovery. Nevertheless, both are still expected to see a fall from fiscal year ‘09. Asa
result, the external current account deficit may come under 5.0 percent of GDP in FY10.
Provided projected foreign inflows are realized SBP’s foreign exchange reserves could improve
further to over $12 billion in this fiscal year.

The ability of the government to control its borrowings from the SBP in cumulative terms and to
raise their targeted amounts in T-bill auctions is another mark of success of the stabilization
program. Though there has been a slight uptick in the last two auctions, yields on government
paper of different tenors have broadly followed a falling trend despite the increased borrowing
requirements from banks. This reflects actual retrenchment of the fiscal deficit and
transparency in the conduct of borrowing operations from the banking system. At the same

We must stay ahead of counterfeiters and protect the
integrity of our currency,’ says Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said the main goal of
security printing for the central bank is to prevent forgery, tampering, and counterfeiting of
banknotes. ‘We must stay ahead of counterfeiters and protect the integrity of our currency,’ he
added.

Inaugurating the Upgraded Security Inks Manufacturing Facility of SICPA (Société
Industrielle et Commerciale de Produits Agricoles), Pakistan in Karachi today, he observed that
the soundness of a nation's currency is essential to the soundness of its economy. ‘As the
nation’s central bank, SBP has a wide range of responsibilities relating to banknotes, from
ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in the currency.,
Together with our partners at Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and the law
enforcement agencies, we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each
denomination, and make re-design decisions based on these threats,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said that gaining and maintaining public confidence in the currency is a key
role for any central bank. ‘Undoubtedly, one of the major challenges facing a central bank in
ensuring public confidence in its currency is the rise of counterfeit banknotes,’ he added.

He said that advanced security features involving ink play a very important role in
defeating the endeavours of counterfeiters, thereby curbing the circulation of fake currency.
‘Increasingly, as counterfeiters become more sophisticated, the central banks admit that they
need to push security printing for new technologies and new substrates,’ he said.

‘To help prevent counterfeiting, SICPA’s security ink technology plays a vital role in
making our banknotes difficult to counterfeit through state-of-the-art security features such as
the Optical Variable Ink (OVI) design, Infra-red ink designs, UV fluorescent ink, and SICPA TALK
ink images,’ he added.

SBP Governor said that it is quite heartening to see the growth of PSPC and its
collaboration with SICPA — the leading global provider of security inks and solutions for most of
the world’s banknotes — for providing SBP and the nation with banknotes embodying the latest

Appropriate measures essential to insulate Asia from

international financial markets turmoil: Dr Akhtar

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that Asia’s inherent
strength and resilience allowed the region to withstand turmoil in the international financial
markets but appropriate policy responses are critical to contain the impact of such external
shocks.

Dr Akhtar was delivering a lecture on ‘Asia: Impact of Recent Global Developments and
Central Bankers’ Response’ in Madrid, Spain yesterday where she was invited by Emerging
Markets Newspaper, a part of Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc., to deliver a keynote
address. In line with its tradition, Emerging Markets Newspaper invites the central bankers of
the region, who have won an award for the region's best central banker, to deliver the keynote
lecture in an event organized on the side lines of the Asian Development Bank’s Annual General
Meeting held in Madrid. Dr Akhtar was conferred with the ‘Best Central Bank Governor for
Asia 2007’ award by the Emerging Markets Newspaper.

Dr Akhtar said that Asia’s inherent strength and resilience remains intact supported by
all-time high reserves being fed by surpluses in external current account boosted regularly by
robust export growth which in case of net oil exporting countries has received additional impetus
from oil export revenues. “This has allowed the region to withstand these shocks but
appropriate policy responses are critical to contain the impact of these shocks,” she asserted.

SBP Governor said there is now a broad consensus that slowdown of US and Europe is
likely to have a more distinct impact on Asia. “Impact has been slow to filter down to Asia in
2007, but is predicted to impact 2008 economic growth,” she said and added that Asian
slowdown is driven largely by set-backs to IT exports, electronic and certain categories of
exports whose impact is now being felt by these industries. With nontraditional export and
diversification of trade to newer markets, Asian exports did grow in a number of countries by
double digit, she said.

Dr Akhtar said that the size and scale of interaction between Asia and America brings
immeasurable benefits when the going is good, but it will also bring a measure of misery when
the economy is in trouble. “Asian central banks and governments need to better integrate with
each other to mitigate and hedge such risks in the future, take advantage of the higher returns,
and take part in the developments in their own region,” she opined.

SBP Governor said that losses on account of subprime mortgage markets were limited on
the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions that have been written off. In the financial
sector, the steepest decline was registered in securities markets that were fast to recover with the

State Banks calls for Banks to accelerate adoption of PayPak Cards for providing low cost
and efficient payment solutions to consumers

adoption of domestic payment scheme, PayPak card by banks in order to provide cost effective,
ubiquitous and digital payment instrument to consumers. He was addressing senior banking and
financial industry executives at the event “PayPak — The Way Forward” held at State Bank of Pakistan

all banks for issuing and acquiring, he encouraged banks to devise strategies for increasing the uptake
of PayPak cards. He advised banks to step up efforts for rationalizing the cost of digital transactions
by reviewing Merchant Discount Rate, increasing access points, and ensuring the safety and security
of payment instruments to safeguard consumers’ money.

Syed Irfan Ali, Executive Director SBP also talked about the importance of collaboration and
partnerships of banks with non-bank such as Fintechs to provide efficient and affordable payment
solutions to consumers. He advised all banks to comply with SBP’s guidelines of EMV compliance to

bank beyond 30"" June, 2018.

Up to $3.5Billion FX inflows to stabilize
Foreign Exchange Markets: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan said today that foreign
exchange inflows to the tune of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion are expected to come in the
banking system in the short to medium-term. These flows coupled with joint efforts of
SBP — Commercial Banks will further stabilize the Pakistani Rupee parity vis-a-vis
U.S. Dollar and calm down foreign exchange markets.

During a meeting with heads of commercial banks at the State Bank of Pakistan
in Karachi, Dr Akhtar assured the participants that there will be ‘no reversal’ of foreign
exchange liberalization measures seen in the past years. However, she expressed her
concerns over excessive volatility and weakened Exchange Rate and commented that
the recent behavior of the exchange market “is totally out of line.”

“We aren’t in a crisis like situation ... several measures are in place to remove
macro-economic imbalances,” she said and added that the Government has expressed
its firm resolve to bring down fiscal-deficit, retire central bank borrowings and cut
non-developmental expenditures. “There is a strong recognition that macro-economic
imbalances have to be resurrected and this is the corner stone of Government’s
economic policy,” she added.

Dr Akhtar informed the meeting that the Government has taken steps to
mobilize foreign funds and added that some of the inflows which are expected to
realize soon include $2.1 billion from Multilateral Banks, $500 million from friendly
countries, $200million for earthquake relief, $100million from DFID, $700million
from MCB Bank’s stake sale, $100 million from Barclays Bank and the rest through
private sector GDRs and other regular sources.

She said that the Government is also taking measures to control inflation and
added that the central bank will continue to remain in a monetary tightening phase.

Given these facts, SBP Governor said: “Current rupee volatility is not reflective
of the macro-economic fundamentals.” She said that she is perplexed over recent Inter-
Bank market behavior and urged banks to play a proactive role to kill negative
sentiments in the market. She said that the central bank has made timely and effective
interventions in the market and added that any future interventions by the central bank
will be in accordance with its analysis of the situation. The Central Bank is vigilant of
the situation and will take the necessary steps as the situation warrants.

“Had we not intervened effectively, the exchange rate would have been at a
different level, but present level doesn’t reflect fundamentals” she added.

SBP Governor urged the bankers to educate their clients, including importers
and exporters, about true macro-economic fundamentals and play their role to bring
stability in the Inter-Bank market, which is not only in the interest of the country but
banks as well.

Banks Disbursed Agricultural Credit of Rs 598.3 billion in FY16

 

During FY16, banks have made agricultural credit disbursement of Rs 598.3 billion which is almost
100% of the overall annual target of Rs 600 billion and 16% higher than the disbursement of Rs 515.9
billion made during FY15.

It is important to note that despite negative growth of agriculture sector due to a number of real side
factors, agri. financing continued its increasing momentum of the last few years. The outstanding
portfolio of agri. loans has also increased by Rs 32.3 billion i.e. from Rs 313.3 billion as on end June
2015 to Rs 345.6 billion as on end June 2016, recording 10.3 % growth during the year. The number of
farmers served by banks also increased from 2.2 million to 2.4 million.

The achievement of agri. credit disbursement was an uphill task for agri. lending institutions due to
various financing issues and real side challenges like low production of major cash crop especially
cotton, climate change, price fluctuation of agri. produce, marketing linkages gaps and high risk
perception of banks about agri. financing, etc.

In addition to implementing various budgetary initiatives, SBP made concerted efforts for achieving
the agri. credit disbursement target set by government. These efforts included; provision of enabling
regulatory environment, sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing as a viable business line, exploring
new financing avenues including; agri value chain financing, warehouse receipts financing, execution
of credit guarantee scheme for small and marginalized farmers and rigorous monitoring of banks’
lending performance.

SBP was able to achieve this target through continued support of the Government and the leadership
role of Governor, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Deputy Governor, Mr. Saeed Ahmad through
conducting regular performance review meetings with banks and other stakeholders. The Governor
and Deputy Governor congratulated and thanked the CEOs/Presidents of banks on meeting their
targets and encouraged them to further enhance agriculture credit in view of the sector’s
contribution in economic growth, employment and exports.

The detailed review of banks’ performance reveals that five major banks collectively disbursed agri.
loans of Rs 311.4 billion or 101.9% of their annual target of Rs 305.7 billion which is higher by 18.4%
from Rs 262.9 billion disbursed during the corresponding period last year. Amongst the five major
banks, NBP has not only surpassed its annual target by achieving 109.2% but also made a major
contribution in overall target achievement. HBL achieved 102.4%, MCB 101.8%, UBL 100.4% of their
respective targets; while, ABL achieved 86.9 % of its annual target.

Under specialized banks, ZTBL disbursed Rs 90.97 billion or 89.2% of its annual target of Rs 102 billion
while PPCBL disbursed Rs 10.3 billion by achieving 82.7% of its target of Rs 12.5 billion during FY16.

Fifteen Domestic Private Banks as a group achieved 93.4% of their target. Within this group, Summit,
JS bank, Bank Alfalah, Habib Metropolitan, Sindh Bank, Soneri and Bank of Khyber have surpassed
their annual targets. However, NIB bank achieved 94.3%, First Women Bank 87.5%, Bank Al Habib
88.5%, Standard Chartered 87.3%, Faysal 84.7%, Askari 83.9%, Silk 77.7% and Bank of Punjab
achieved 43% of the annual target during the period under review.

Governor Wathra directs Banks to improve regional and sectoral

allocation of agri. credit

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has urged the banks to understand the
needs of the economy and focus on agri. financing as it is a viable business activity having huge cash
flows, and significant contribution in GDP with strong backward and forward linkages.

He was addressing the annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) which
was held under his chairmanship in Multan today. The meeting was attended by senior officers of
SBP, presidents and executives from commercial banks, specialized banks, microfinance banks &
Islamic banks, representatives of federal & provincial governments, and farmer chambers/
associations.

While delivering his keynote address, Mr. Wathra highlighted the active role played by the Central
Bank for promoting agri finance in the country. He emphasized that over the years State Bank of
Pakistan has adapted itself into the role of a facilitator and developmental partner of financial
institutions to accelerate the growth of agriculture finance in the country.

He further stressed that financial institutions need to strengthen their agricultural finance policies,
increase dedicated human resource, simplify lending procedures, rationalize lending rates, work
diligently for creating mass awareness, and develop other prerequisites for building lending portfolios
and timely provision of credit to farmers and harness untapped potential of agri. credit demand in the
country.

The keynote address was followed by a briefing wherein the performance of banks on key indicators
relevant to agricultural financing was reviewed. The briefing also covered important initiatives taken
by SBP to improving the access of financial services to marginalized farmers. The participants
deliberated on the way forward for credit enhancement in the underserved provinces/regions. The
ACAC members proposed, amongst other things, the need for collaboration of banks and government
departments for promotion of agri. credit, enhancement of agri. credit infrastructure in underserved
areas and development of Shariah compliant products and services for meeting the financial
requirements of faith sensitive clients.

The meeting was informed that during FY 2015-16, banks disbursed agricultural credit of Rs 598.3
billion which is nearly 100% of the overall annual target of Rs 600 billion and 16% higher than the
disbursement of Rs 515.9 billion made during FY 2014-15. Moreover, for FY 2016-17, during the first
six months (July-December, 2016) financial institutions have disbursed Rs 301.7 billion which is 43.1
percent of the indicative target of Rs 700 billion for the year.

The ACAC proposed the following key actions:
|. Allocation of geographical and sector wise targets and enhancement of agri. credit
infrastructure particularly in underserved area;
Il. Expediting the loan approval process by delegation of authority at branch/regional level;
IIL. Development/adoption of digital innovations to improve financial services of the small
farmers;
IV. Devise mechanism to provide wholesale lending products to microfinance Banks/Institutions
to strengthen outreach of small farmers;
V. Development of long term financing facility for the promotion of fruit orchards;

State Bank issues draft
“Branchless Banking Guidelines”

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar today announced the
launching of Branchless Banking (BB) by using delivery channels like retail agents, mobile
phones etc. This represents a significantly cheaper alternative to conventional branch-based
banking and allows financial institutions and other commercial players to offer financial services
outside traditional banks’ premises. BB can be used to substantially increase the financial
services outreach to the un-banked communities. Provision of enabling regulatory environment
by careful risk-reward balancing is necessary to use such models.

In line with its responsibility to promote financial inclusion without risking the safety and
soundness of the banking system, the State Bank issued a policy paper on regulatory framework
for mobile banking in Pakistan which stipulated SBP’s strategy for promoting branchless
banking in Pakistan. SBP has now prepared draft guidelines as part of the broader strategy to
create enabling regulatory environment to promote Bank-led Model of branchless banking and
sought comments from all the stakeholders. The primary audiences of these draft guidelines are
financial institutions (Commercial Banks, Islamic Banks, Microfinance Banks and Development
Finance Institutions) desirous to undertake branchless banking. However, as financial institutions
cannot take on BB without the help of other market players like telecom companies, technology
service providers, agents etc., the comments of such other parties on the draft will also be
welcomed.

These draft guidelines outline permissible branchless banking activities and necessary
requirements and procedures for conducting these activities. Guidelines also contain sections
defining key roles and responsibilities, use of agents for conducting branchless banking activities
(including cash deposit and withdrawal), use of third party service providers, data & network
security, risk management program and customer protection and awareness. A salient feature of
these guidelines is the introduction of ‘Risk Based Customer Due Diligence (CDD)’ which
rationalizes the KYC/CDD requirements with the levels of risk exposures.

As part of its consultative approach and to take all stakeholders in confidence, SBP has
asked for feedback/comments on these guidelines by December 10, 2007. Detailed Guidelines
are available on SBP website: www.sbp.org.pk. State Bank plans to finalize these guidelines by
December 31, 2007.

The financial sector remains in a sound
and stable state, says the SBP’s Financial Stability Review for CY16

 

The State Bank of Pakistan issued today its annual publication viz., Financial Stability Review
(FSR). The Review presents an analytical assessment of the financial sector during CY16, its
associated risks and resilience analysis of the banking sector.

The FSR concludes that the financial sector of Pakistan remains in a sound and stable state at
the end of CY16. The performance of both the financial and non-financial sectors has improved
the risk profile of the system as a whole, as the risks to the financial system remained subdued
but are actually reducing. However, some emerging low to moderate level risks in the short to
medium term need attention and are being closely monitored by SBP.

The financial sector has operated in a relatively challenging global environment in CY16. The
review highlights some global concerns such as low world economic growth, especially slow
growth in advanced economies and oil-price induced economic shocks in the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries (the major export destinations and source of remittances flows for
Pakistan); international trade slowdown; rising protectionist sentiments and the policy
normalization in the US which might lead to tighter financial conditions in the Emerging
Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Going forward, it recommends that these
developments warrant policymaker’s attention.

The Review suggests that the domestic macrofinancial environment has been conducive in
CY16: Output (both GDP and LSM) has been increasing; inflation remains subdued; exchange
rate is stable amid adequate reserves; government borrowing from banking sector has receded,
law and order conditions have improved and economic prospects are encouraging, more so, in
view of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Not surprisingly, performance of the banking
sector has been satisfactory and financial markets, in general, have performed smoothly. In
addition, the corporate sector has also benefited from the favorable macrofinancial conditions
and has posted robust profits.

Banking sector — which accounts for around three-fourth of the financial sector — has

performed well. Encouragingly, the growth momentum of advances has picked up further, with
private sector as the main beneficiary, while asset quality has improved with a decline in
infection ratios. Specifically, gross advances have increased by 12.81 percent in CY16 compared

posted at the SBP website (htpp://www.sbp.org.pk).

Regulations from all the stakeholders, particularly the bankers, agriculturists and
members of the General Public.

Agriculture Financing should be sent directly to Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad,
Director, Banking Policy Department, State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi through mail,

SBP Announces Concessionary Financing Facility for Special persons

 

State Bank of Pakistan issued a concessionary Small Enterprise Financing and Credit
Guarantee Facility for Special persons. Mr. Tariq Bajwa, the Governor State Bank of
Pakistan announced this special facility in the 7"" meeting of the National Assembly
Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs held at State Bank of
Pakistan. Members of the Standing Committee and senior executives of State Bank of

Pakistan were also present on the occasion.

“Realizing the vulnerability of persons with disabilities in the country and cost
associated with their exclusion for the economy, SBP in-line with its priority sector
development has devised a scheme for special persons”, said Tariq Bajwa. This
financing facility is expected to improve access to finance for special persons falling
under Small Enterprise (SE) category at a concessional rate of 5% per annum. Under
the scheme, banks and DFls will provide financing facilities to special persons for
establishing new business enterprises or for expansion of existing businesses. State
Bank of Pakistan will provide refinance to banks/ DFIs up to 100% of finance extended
by them. Special persons can avail financing up to Rs 1.5 million for a maximum period
of 5 years including grace period of 6 months. SBP will also provide risk coverage of
60% to banks/ DFIs on their outstanding loans under the scheme. This financing facility
has been issued with the main objective of improving the socio-economic life of special

persons in Pakistan.

Frequently Asked Questions in respect of Foreign Currency Accounts Rules

Please also see the SBP press release on the SRO by Ministry of Finance available at:
https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2020/Pr-11-Oct-20.pdf

Question 1. Why there was a need to issue SRO by Ministry of Finance, if there is no change in existing
foreign exchange regulations?

Ans. Protection of Economic Reforms Act 1992 (PERA) was amended in 2018. The amendments made
in PERA included, inter alia, that federal government may make rules governing deposits into and
withdrawals from the foreign currency accounts. The purpose for issuance of these rules is to
provide enabling provisions for SBP to issue instructions related to deposits in FCY accounts,
including those already in place as well as any that may be issued in future.

In this way, these rules aim to provide a framework for the operation of individual foreign currency
accounts. In addition, the rules also formalize the mandate given to SBP to strengthen the foreign
exchange regime and to make it easier for the individuals to meet their foreign currency needs
through banking channels.

Question 2. Would SBP issue any guidelines for FCY accounts in accordance with the rules to clarify
the situation?

Ans. There is no change in State Bank’s existing regulations regarding FCY accounts and these
regulations do not conflict with the rules issued by Ministry of Finance.

Question 3. Do the rules have any impact on the newly introduced Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) for
Non-Resident Pakistanis?

Ans. No, RDA is a distinct scheme for Non Resident Pakistanis, offering both FCY and PKR accounts.
Funds can be received into these accounts from abroad but they cannot be fed from within Pakistan.
Proceeds of investments, profit thereon and any balances in these accounts are freely repatriable
without any approval oor hindrance. For more details, please refer to:
https://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2020/FEC2.htm

phase out all remaining old design banknotes of Rs 10, 50, 100 & 1000. The Rs 5 banknote and the old
design Rs 500 banknote have already been demonetized.

It is worth mentioning that the State Bank of Pakistan issued a new design banknote series which
started with the issuance of Rs 20 denomination banknote in 2005 to improve the security, durability
and aesthetic quality of banknotes. The process of issuance of complete series of new design
banknotes comprising eight denominations (Rs 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000) was
completed in 2008.

The commercial/microfinance banks will accept the old design banknotes of Rs 10, 50, 100 and 1000
and exchange the same with the new design banknotes and coins of all denominations up to
30'November 2016 only. However, SBP BSC field offices will continue to accept the old design
banknotes of Rs 10, 50, 100 & 1000 from general public up to December 31, 2021.

The last day to exchange all old design banknotes from banks is November 30, 2016.All old design
banknotes shall cease to be legal tender on December 01, 2016 while last day to exchange all such
banknotes from SBP BSC field offices is December 31, 2021.

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
May 15, 2020

1. At its meeting on 15 May 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy
rate by 100 basis points to 8 percent. This decision reflected the MPC’s view that the inflation outlook has
improved further in light of the recent cut in domestic fuel prices. As a result, inflation could fall closer to the
lower end of the previously announced ranges of 11-12 percent this fiscal year and 7-9 percent next fiscal

year.

2. ‘The MPC highlighted that the coronavirus pandemic has created unique challenges for monetary policy
due to its non-economic origin and the temporary disruption of economic activity required to combat it.
While easier monetary policy can neither affect the rate of infection transmission nor prevent the near-term
fall in economic activity due to lockdowns, it can provide liquidity support to households and businesses to
help them through the ensuing temporary phase of economic disruption. In particular, the successive policy
rate cuts and sizeable cheap loans provided through the SBP’s enhanced refinancing facilities have helped
maintain credit flows, bolster the cash flow of borrowers, and support asset prices. This has contained the
tightening of financial conditions that would otherwise have amplified the initial necessary contraction in
activity.

3. The MPC noted the swift and forceful monetary easing of 525 basis point in the two months since the
beginning of the crisis and SBP’s measures to extend principal repayments, provide payroll financing, and
other measures to support liquidity. Together with the government’s proactive fiscal stimulus—including
targeted support packages for low-income households, SMEs, and construction—as well as assistance from
the international community, these actions should provide ample cushion to growth and employment, while
also maintaining financial stability. This coordinated and broad-based policy response has provided relief and
stability and should provide support for recovery as the pandemic subsides.

4. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

5. The MPC noted three key developments since the last MPC meeting on 16"" April, 2020. First, the
government has significantly reduced petrol and diesel prices by 30-40 percent in response to the continued
fall in global oil prices, which has improved the outlook for inflation. Second, most countries, including
Pakistan, have begun easing lockdowns, which should help provide support to economic activity.
Nevertheless, as elsewhere, the situation remains highly uncertain. A possible rise in infections could prompt
fresh lockdowns, and the recovery could prove more sluggish than is currently being anticipated. Third, due
to timely policy actions and international assistance, the initial volatility observed in domestic financial and
foreign exchange markets has somewhat subsided in recent weeks, although global financial conditions
remain considerably tighter than before the coronavirus outbreak. Recent supportive developments have
helped to restore the SBP’s foreign reserves position to close to pre-coronavirus levels of over US$ 12 billion.

Prospects for Remittances

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in collaboration with Ministry of Planning, Development and Special
Initiatives (MPD&SI) has launched a survey of Overseas Pakistanis to analyze recent trends in
remittances and the future outlook. The survey will be available to all Overseas Pakistanis globally till

The survey attempts to assess underlying factors that may have affected recent remittances behavior,
including switching from informal to formal channels, from brick and mortar outlets to digital platforms,
future plans of moving back to Pakistan, as well as the amount of remittances they expect to send in
the next six months.

With the support of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (MOPHRD),
Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI), this
survey is being conducted simultaneously at Pakistani Consulates and Embassies, Overseas Bank
Branches of Pakistani Banks as well as online.

SBP and MPD&SI encourage Overseas Pakistanis to actively participate in this short online survey. The
survey is very easy to access through the following web link:

STATE BANK ISSUES ITS MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT

The State Bank of Pakistan issued its Monetary Policy Statement which was
approved by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting held under the
Chairmanship of the Governor, Dr. Ishrat Husain in Quetta today. The distinguishing
feature of the Statement is a public announcement of the monetary policy stance to be
followed by SBP during the next six months of the current fiscal year ie. July—
December 2005.

The Statement, after reviewing the monetary and external sector developments
of the last six months and the macroeconomic outlook, has observed that the balance
of risks indicates that domestic prices may continue to remain under pressure on
account of high world oil prices, widening trade deficit and rising interest rates in the
world financial markets during July-December 2005.

While continuing to observe movements of all key variables and taking timely
corrective actions, the State Bank has reaffirmed its resolve that the key objective of
the monetary policy would be to fight inflation and bring it down to a reasonable level
during the next six months. The monetary policy stance of a tightened monetary
expansion would, therefore, continue until inflationary pressures are eased off,
according to the Statement.

The State Bank of Pakistan would also ensure stability in exchange rates. The
extent of the interest rate changes will be determined by the magnitude, direction and
speed of inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, the State Bank of Pakistan would also
ensure that the credit expansion is targeted to support SME and agriculture sectors
that generate most of the employment in the country, further capacity expansion of
vital industries and BMR initiatives, the Statement added.

The text of the Monetary Policy Statement is enclosed.

Apropos news item appearing in a section of media regrading unavailability of record pertaining to
destruction of old design Rs.500 banknotes. The SBP categorically denies and rejects the media reports
regarding unavailability of the record of old design Rs.500 banknotes demonetized in Oct 2012. The
destruction of banknotes is an ongoing activity and is carried out across the country at field offices of
SBPBSC, the record for the same is available in respective field offices. The Audit team however, just
visited SBPBSC Karachi and assumed that the record available at Karachi is the total record available
with the SBP, which is factually incorrect. The complete record of banknote’s destruction is available at

SBPBSC field offices located in 16 cities across the country.

Branchless Banking continues to show rising trend: SBP

Branchless Banking (BB) continued to show a rising trend in the third quarter (January-
March 2012) of the current fiscal year (2011-12) during which BB transactions surged by 23
percent to 25.3 million as compared with 20.6 million in the preceding quarter. The value of
these transactions was recorded at Rs 85.092 billion, showing a growth of 7 percent as
compared with Rs 79.410 billion in the quarter ended on December 31, 2011.

According to SBP’s ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’, the average daily BB transactions
increased to 280,798 in the third quarter showing a growth of 23 percent as compared to
228,858 transactions in the previous quarter. BB deposits grew by 18 percent to Rs 594 million
in Jan-March 2012 quarter as compared with Rs 503 million in the preceding quarter.

The total number of Branchless Banking agents increased by 19 percent to 26,792 in
January-March FY12 quarter as compared with 22,512 in the quarter ended on December 31,
2011. Similarly, the total number of BB accounts surged by 14 percent to surpass one million
mark (1,059,519) in the quarter under-review as compared with 929,184 in the previous
quarter.

The BB agents now have the footprint in 89% of the total districts in Pakistan out of
which 52% have more than 90 agents which are mainly located in low income urban or rural
communities.

The number of registered m-wallet accounts (a popular Branchless Banking service in
which cash value is stored on mobile phone of a customer; this can be used to deposit,
withdrawal, and money transfer through the mobile phone) reached to 1.03 million at the end
of the quarter under review in which the number of active m-wallets is about 53%. About 5,573
debit cards have also been provided to mobile account holders, indicating efforts to create
value proposition in m-wallets.

Bills payment remained the dominating activity of Branchless Banking with 42% share in
total transaction volume, followed by person to person (over the counter) fund transfers and
airtime top-ups with share of 32% and 10% respectively. Branchless Banking service providers
are trying to increase their linkages with microfinance institutions as loan repayments of Rs.312
million were collected through BB agents during the quarter under review.

The growth expectation in the area of Branchless Banking is fairly high as the largest
brand of the country is in process of technology up-gradation for account opening, forth which
it will start registration of customers for Level Zero Account (per month transactions limit

State Bank of Pakistan Designates Domestic Systemically Important Banks

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has today announced the designation of Domestic Systemically
Important Banks (D-SIBs) for the year 2020 under the Framework for Domestic Systemically
Important Banks that was introduced in April 2018.

The framework introduced by State Bank is consistent with the international standards and
practices and takes into account the local dynamics. It specifies the methodology for the
identification and designation of D-SIBs, enhanced regulatory and supervisory requirements, and
implementation guidelines. These enhanced requirements aim to further strengthen the
resilience of the Systemically Important banks against shocks and augment their risk management
capacities.

The identification of D-SIBs involves two-step process. In the first step, sample banks are
identified each year based on the quantitative and qualitative criteria. In the second step, D-SIBs
are designated from among the sample banks on the basis of institutions’ systemic score in terms
of their size, interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity.

In line with D-SIBs Framework, State Bank has carried out the annual assessment on the basis of
financials of end December 2019. As per this assessment, three banks viz. Habib Bank Ltd.,
National Bank of Pakistan, and United Bank Ltd. have been designated as D-SIBs for the year 2019.
These banks will continue to follow enhanced supervisory requirements as well as the following
additional common equity tier-1 capital (CET-1) requirements:

BUCKET Name of Institution Requirement for
Bucket
D Empty 3.5%
ei National Bank of Pakistan and >.09%
Habib Bank Ltd.
B Empty 1.5%
United Bank Ltd (UBL). 1.0%

 

 

 

 

 

Besides, branches of Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) operating in Pakistan will
hold additional CET1 capital against their risk-weighted assets in Pakistan at the rate as
applicable on the respective principal G-SIB.

Reforms and Active Private Sector Participation Can Boost Economic Growth

State Bank of Pakistan released its Annual Report on the State of Economy for the year 2015-16 today.
According to the Report, Pakistan’s economy maintained its momentum towards a higher growth
trajectory in FY16, as higher infrastructure spending by the government and decades low interest rates
provided a boost to domestic demand. Side by side, improvements in energy supply and the security
situation also supported this momentum.

The Report further explains that though some macroeconomic indicators were short of targets, they
still posted better performance over the last year. For instance, real GDP growth of 4.7 percent during
FY16 was below its target, but nevertheless higher than the growth achieved a year earlier. Meanwhile,
the accumulation of the country’s foreign exchange reserves reached an all-time high level at end
FY16; the exchange rate remained stable; and CPI inflation fell to only 2.9 percent during the year.
Similarly, fiscal consolidation remained on track, and the budget deficit was reduced to 4.6 percent of
GDP — the lowest since FY07.

Notwithstanding these positive macroeconomic stability gains, the Report highlights some challenges
as well. Firstly, the current level of private investments and savings in the country needs acceleration to
keep pace with required investible resources. Secondly, structural issues in the export industry need to
be resolved. Thirdly, the reliance of the tax system on stop-gap measures is creating distortions in the
economy. Finally, the country needs to spend more on social sector development to address social
issues.

The Report, however, views Pakistan to be well positioned to address these challenges. It anticipates
all-important support coming from a stable macroeconomic environment and growing investments in
CPEC-related projects. These would help improve the existing infrastructure and power supplies to
businesses.

As for the short-term economic outlook, the Report recognizes the positive impact of improved
macroeconomic environment, better energy supplies, and subsiding security concerns. In addition to
CPEC, economic activity would benefit from pro-growth policies: the policy rate currently stands at a
historic low of 5.75 percent, which has made funding easier for businesses and consumers. Similarly,
growing development spending, despite a planned reduction in budget deficit, would continue to
support infrastructure-related industries.

Given this backdrop, the government envisages a GDP growth of 5.7 percent for FY17. At the same
time, the current account deficit is likely to stay in the range of 0.5 — 1.5 percent of GDP during the
year. In this context, the Report draws attention to the IMF program’s contribution in restoring
macroeconomic stability and confidence of international creditors. Crucially, it maintains that the
reform process — related to energy-sector, loss-making PSEs (like PSM, PIA), and business-friendly
regulations — must continue after the IMF program’s completion. Finally, the Report reiterates that
without private sector participation, it will be hard to achieve a higher and sustainable growth that is
built on the pillars of entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness.

The detailed Report is available at SBP website www.sbp.org.pk.

Governor SBP apprises President Arif Alvi on measures for Differently Abled persons

His Excellency President Islamic Republic of Pakistan Dr. Arif Alvi visited State Bank of Pakistan today
for a Roundtable Discussion on Financial Inclusion of Differently Abled Persons hosted by Governor
State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir. Senior officials of SBP, Presidents and CEOs of Banks and
representatives of Network of Organizations Working for People with Disabilities, Pakistan (NOWPDP)
also participated in this roundtable discussion.

Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir welcomed the President and gave a detailed presentation on the two
types of interventions by SBP for the differently abled persons. These include initiatives taken by SBP
to facilitate the differently abled persons for accessing banking premises and services and, providing
access to finance through various SBP refinance schemes. He informed the President about the
regulatory instructions for the banks by SBP and its own initiatives to address the problems faced by
different categories of differently abled persons and their progress since 2018.

For people faced with challenges related to upper and lower limb, Governor shared with the President
that various steps have been taken to facilitate them including providing preferential treatment/out of
queue assistance; construction of ramps at the entrance of existing branches and ATM cabins to allow
easy access to special persons and wheelchair users; relaxation in the requirement of biometric
verification for account opening; and facilitation desks for special persons at SBP main building and its
offices countrywide. Regarding steps taken by SBP to facilitate persons with visual impairment,
Governor SBP informed the President about the special features of currency notes such as size, lines &
dots; installation of Talking ATMs; provision of ATM/Debit and internet banking facilities; and
countrywide awareness sessions on features of currency notes.

With respect to the second type of SBP interventions, Dr. Baqir apprised the President about two credit
schemes supported by SBP for the financial inclusion of differently abled persons. The first is the Small
Enterprise Financing and Credit Guarantee Scheme, which is available to differently abled persons
holding CNIC with a special logo/symbol for setting up new business enterprises or for expansion of
existing ones at a subsidized financing rate of 5% per annum for the tenor of 5 years including grace
period of up to 6 months. The second SBP scheme is Financing Facility of Low Cost Housing for Special
Segments including differently abled persons that provides subsidized loans to widows, children of
Shaheed, transgender, special persons and persons in the areas severely affected by war against
terrorism. Under the scheme, special segments can avail subsidized financing at 5% per annum, for the
tenor of 12.5 years including grace period of up to 6 months. Information about these schemes is
available SBP website (http://www.sbp.org.pk/Incen-others/sme-7.asp and
http://www.sbp.org.pk/Incen-others/Low.asp).

SBP launches complaint resolution portal to promote affordable housing

The Prime Minister of Pakistan chaired a meeting of National Coordination Committee on Housing,
Construction and Development (NCCHCD) in Islamabad today. Governor State Bank, Dr. Reza Baqir,
presented key features of an online complaint resolution mechanism developed by State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) to resolve complaints of potential customers under Government’s Markup Subsidy
Scheme for affordable housing. The Prime Minister appreciated the development of a user friendly and
comprehensive complaint resolution mechanism to assist common persons who would like to borrow
under this Scheme. The complaint resolution mechanism comprises an IT based portal supported by a
comprehensive network of State Bank and commercial bank staff to take care of problems faced by
applicants of low cost and affordable housing finance. The IT portal has been made live for registration
of complaints. This major initiative will help financially excluded low and middle-income segments who
often find it difficult to access the formal financial sector, which is a key goal of the SBP. The system
will help in resolving complaints within a predefined timeline with proper escalation mechanism.

The potential customers can already access existing systems and procedures of banks for resolution of
their complaints. The complaint resolution mechanism developed by State Bank is a move to improve
effectiveness and transparency in complaint redressal process.

In line with Government's vision of making housing finance affordable, State Bank has, on October 12,
2020, issued Government’s Mark-up Subsidy for Housing Finance to facilitate provision of subsidized
finance to low and middle-income individuals. The features of Markup Subsidy Facility can be seen at
https://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C11.htm.

 

The State Bank is making efforts with the support of banking industry to ensure that the benefits of the
markup subsidy scheme reaches targeted customers of banks who currently do not own a house. On
the advice of State Bank of Pakistan, the banks have designated around 50% of their branches for
provision of financing under this facility. With this, more than 7,700 branches of banks across the
country have been designated to process financing of approaching customers under this scheme, while
rest of the branches in the network will act as referral points for the designated branches.

With the launch of portal, customers can now register their concerns by simply putting minimum details
on the online service portal accessible at https://servicedesk.sbp.org.pk/. A short video is also available
on this portal to explain how complaints may be lodged and followed up. In case applicants face
difficulties in using this portal or need further clarification they are welcome to visit the offices of SBP
BSC in 15 major cities where special Help Desks are available to guide and assist, list of offices is
available at https://www.sbp.org.pk/sbp bsc/FieldOff.asp. In order to facilitate resolution of
complaints received under the Markup Subsidy Service Portal, State Bank has created a network of
regional focal persons in State Bank BSC regional offices. The banks have also nominated their regional
focal persons across the regions in the country where State Bank offices are present.

Holistic approach needed for development of agri finance: Ishaq Dar

Federal Minister for Finance Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar has said that a holistic approach is
needed for development of agricultural sector and agri finance in Pakistan. He was speaking as
Chief Guest at the launching ceremony of the 2"" Challenge Round of Financial Innovation
Challenge Fund (FICF) on “Promoting Innovative Rural and Agriculture Finance in Pakistan” in
Islamabad today. The programme is being funded by UKAid and implemented by the State Bank
of Pakistan as part of “Pakistan Financial Inclusion Programme”.

He said that the partnership between DFID and SBP in promoting financial inclusion to reduce
poverty in Pakistan had further strengthened the bond between the two countries.
Congratulating the State Bank and the UK Government, he said that this would go a long way in
promoting inclusive economic growth through provision of demand-driven innovative financial
services for the low-income and unbanked population particularly our agricultural households
and rural entrepreneurs.

He reminded the audience of measures taken by PML (N) government in the 1990s which
included banking sector reforms in Pakistan, adding that since then, Pakistan’s banking industry
had witnessed a major transformation.

In his welcome address, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Acting Governor State Bank of Pakistan,
said financial innovation needs to be targeted towards the productivity of small farmers to
combat poverty in rural areas. He said that tackling poverty demanded fundamental rethinking
and innovation.

He reminded the audience that improving financial access to alleviate poverty was a global
challenge. “More than 2 billion adults in the world do not have access to formal or semi-formal
financial services. At the same time, one billion people with mobile phones do not have even a
basic bank account.”

He said that both the Government and the State Bank of Pakistan were addressing the
challenge using innovative policy approaches and actions.

SBP introduced new refinance scheme to avoid layoff of workers

 

To support the employment of workers in the face of economic challenges posed by the spread of
COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has introduced a temporary refinance scheme for
businesses entitled Refinance Scheme for Payment of Wages and Salaries to the Workers and
Employees of Business Concerns. The core objective of this facility is to incentivize businesses to not
lay off their workers during COVID-19 Pandemic.

The scheme will be available to all businesses in Pakistan through banks and will cover all types of
employees including permanent, contractual, daily wages as well as outsourced workers. The scheme
will provide financing for wages and salaries expense for three months from April to June 2020 for
those businesses which do not layoff their employees for these three months.

The mark-up on the loans under this scheme will be up to 5%. Borrowers that are on the active
taxpayers list, will be able to get loans at a further reduced mark-up rate of 4%. The scheme has been
designed to give preference to smaller businesses. Businesses with a 3 month wage and salary expense
of up to Rs. 200 million will be able to avail the full amount of their expense in financing while those
with a 3 month wage and salary expense of greater than Rs. 500 million will be able to avail up to 50%
of their expense. Businesses in the middle category will be able to avail up to 75 percent of their 3
months’ salary and wage expense.

The banks will not charge any loan processing fee, credit limit fee or prepayment penalties for loans
under this scheme. A grace period of six months will be allowed to the borrowers while the repayment
of the principal amount will be made in two years. Banks will provide weekly reporting to SBP on the
take up of the scheme and in particular the reasons for any denials of financing requests under this
scheme.

SBP expects that one of the main benefits of the scheme is that employers that retain workers on their
payroll will be able to restore or increase production quickly once the situation normalizes. The scheme
will ease the liquidity constraints of the businesses and they can use their available financial resources
to meet other working capital requirements.

Interested businesses can access details of the scheme at
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C6.htm and
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C7.htm. For further clarification for any information
not available at this website, interested businesses can get further information from SBP by writing to
covid19.stimulus@sbp.org.pk or calling 021-111727273 during normal business hours.

SBP has taken a number of other measures in recent weeks to mitigate the impact of covid19 on
Pakistan’s economy including an extension in repayment of loan principal amounts by one year,
concessional financing for hospitals to procure equipment to combat covid19 as well as other
measures. A complete list of all measures is available at http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp. SBP has
been closely monitoring the credit conditions faced by the businesses and households and will take
every possible measure to perform its due role throughout this disruption phase.

Workers’ Remittances rise to record monthly high in July 2020

 

In July, workers' remittances rose to US $ 2,768.1 million. This is the highest ever level of
remittances in a single month in Pakistan.

In terms of growth, remittances increased by 36.5 percent over July 2019 (y/y) and 12.2 percent
over June 2020 (m/m). Given the impact of Covid-19 globally, this increase in worker’s remittances
is encouraging.

In July, sizeable amounts of workers' remittances were received from Saudi Arabia (US $ 821.6
million), UAE (US $ 538.2 million), UK (US $ 393.9 million) and USA (US $ 250.6 million).

The growth rate in remittances compared to the same month in the previous year is around twice
as high as the Eid-ul-Adha related seasonality typically experienced over the last decade.

Several factors have likely supported the growth in remittances to date, including orderly
exchange rate conditions and policy steps taken by the State Bank and the Federal Government
under the Pakistan Remittance Initiative. These steps include reducing the threshold for eligible
transactions from USD 200 to USD 100 under the Reimbursement of Telegraphic Transfer (TT)
Charges Scheme, an increased push towards adoption of digital channels, and targeted marketing
campaigns to promote formal channels for sending remittances.

To improve data quality and better capture the source country of the remitter, the compilation
methodology for ‘country wise’ workers’ remittances has been strengthened from this month.
Therefore, country-by-country trends will be available on a consistent basis from August 2020
onwards. Importantly, the new data collection method does not affect the reporting of the level
of remittances arriving into Pakistan. Further information on the improvement in the data
reporting is available at the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/Homeremit.pdf

 

http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/Homeremit.xls

 

Importantly, the revised country shares under the improved data do not necessarily imply that
remittances from one country have increased over another. Instead they demonstrate that the
source country of remittances is being recorded more accurately now.

Banking industry join hands to create Pakistan

Corporate Restructuring Company Limited (PCRCL)

The Presidents and representatives of Habib Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank, MCB Bank,
Allied Bank, Meezan Bank, Bank Al-falah, Bank Al-Habib, Habib Metropolitan Bank and Faysal Bank
signed today the shareholders’ agreement for the establishment of Pakistan Corporate Restructuring
Company Limited (PCRCL) at State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Karachi in the presence of Governor, SBP.

Under the provisions of Corporate Restructuring Companies Act 2016 and with an initial Paid-up Capital
of Rs500 million, the above banks have decided to establish the Corporate Restructuring Company
(CRC), which is first such type of company in Pakistan. The objectives of the CRC are aligned with the
initiatives of the Government of Pakistan to revive the sick industrial units.

It would be pertinent to mention here that the CRCs, under CRC Act 2016, are empowered to acquire,
restructure and resolve the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of financial institutions and thereby
reorganize and revive the commercially or financially distressed companies. The CRCs are specialized
institutions with skillset in NPL resolution and corporate restructuring. These companies through
aggregation of NPLs, will be well positioned to negotiate with the sick units and finalize the
restructuring of loans vis-a-vis multiple lenders negotiating simultaneously with the borrower. It is
expected that CRCs will evolve as vibrant economic agent, contributing towards the revival of sick
industrial units and generating employment opportunities.

Total Non-Performing Loans of the banking industry stand at Rs758 billion as of September 30, 2019.
Total NPL amount includes the loans against such sick industrial units, which can be revived and
rehabilitated, provided the NPLs are restructured promptly and the sponsors of the sick units also inject
the fresh equity to demonstrate their willingness and commitment in the rehabilitation of sick units.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has granted the license to PCRCL on
December 31, 2019. State Bank of Pakistan appreciates the initiative of above banks and the supportive
role of the SECP in incorporation and licensing of PCRCL.

SBP is also engaged with the Federal Government to introduce amendments in the relevant laws and
to strengthen the Banking Courts in order to take forward Government’s agenda of institutional
reforms,

Workers’ Remittances Remain Strong in August

 

e In August, workers’ remittances remained above $2 billion for the third month in a row. They
reached $ 2.095 billion, which is 24.4 percent higher than during the same month last year and
largely in line with SBP projections.

. Over the last three months, remittances reached an unprecedented level of $7.3
billion, 37.2 percent higher than the same period last year.

° Efforts under the Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) and the gradual re-opening of
businesses in major host countries such as Middle East, Europe and United States contributed
to this increase.

° The top three originating countries for remittances in August were: Saudi Arabia ($0.593
billion), UAE ($0.410 billion) and UK ($0.302 billion)

° Ona m/m basis, remittances were 24.3 percent lower than the record level of remittances of
S 2.768 billion posted in July, mainly reflecting the usual seasonal decline in the post Eid-al-
Adha period.

SBP Governor chairs meeting of bankers / brokers

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar presided over a meeting of bankers
and stock brokers at SBP Karachi this afternoon. The meeting discussed a number of proposals
regarding financing against shares to brokers and decided that the existing facilities of “Financing
against Shares to Members of Stock Exchange” outstanding as on 31* August 2008 will be
converted into a Term Finance Facility of one year. Borrowers, during the term of the facility, can
repay the amount but no fresh disbursement under this facility will be allowed.

It was also decided in the meeting that in addition to shares, the banks may also accept other types
of collateral like residential plots, houses, etc. to secure existing financing against shares to
brokers. This additional collateral may be provided by brokers if the value of marketable securities
is not sufficient or to create sufficient cushion in the margin in case of further market decline. The
objective of this arrangement is to avoid unnecessary margin calls in case of market decline during
first few days after the removal of floor on 27"" October, 2008.

At present, the exposure against shares is subject to a minimum margin of 30%. Banks are
required to give a margin call when the margin breaches this limit. It was decided that while at the
start of the facility the minimum margin may continue to be 30%, but banks may not give a margin
call until the margin breaches 25% limit.

It was agreed in the meeting that banks may also consider accepting the membership card of
brokers as collateral subject to the fulfillment of all requisite legal formalities and necessary
approvals.

The banks have been given two limits for exposure against shares:

a. Ready market (20% of the equity for banks; for Islamic banks and for DFIs which are
mobilizing deposits, the limit is 35%)
b. An additional 10% against exposures in Futures contract.

The meeting also approved the proposal to combine the two exposures limits, with a proviso that
exposure in Futures will not exceed 10% of equity. This will provide some room for banks to
increase their ready market exposure provided their Futures contracts exposure is lower than 10%.

The decisions taken in the meeting will save the market from chaos and uncertainty in case of
further decline and facilitate the stakeholders to play their due role in the development of capital
market. The changes being brought out in the regulatory framework as a result of these decisions
will provide necessary flexibility to both lenders and borrowers to adjust their respective positions
with ease and comfort.

It may be recalled that State Bank Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, held a series of meetings
during the last few days with bankers and brokers in an effort to arrive at an amicable solution of
the stock exchange crisis.

ACAC EXPRESSES SATISFACTION OVER THE DISBURSEMENT OF
CREDIT TO THE AGRI. SECTOR DURING FIRST HALF OF FY06

The Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) met in Karachi today
under the Chairmanship of the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad
Akhtar to review the flow of credit to agriculture sector during the first six months of
the current fiscal year.

The Committee expressed satisfaction that the growth momentum in
agriculture credit disbursement achieved during the last two years was maintained in
the first half of the current fiscal year (July-December 2005) as banks disbursed Rs.62
billion to this sector, which is 25% higher than the disbursement of Rs.49.5 billion
made in the corresponding period last year. The five big banks, as a group, disbursed
Rs.33.5 billion while ZTBL, domestic private banks and PPCBL disbursed Rs.19.303
billion, Rs.7.1 billion and Rs.2 billion respectively.

The ACAC noted with satisfaction that major portion of the credit i.e. 68%,
went to the small farmers whereas the medium and big farmers received 23% and 9%
respectively of the total credit disbursed during the first half of the current fiscal year.
Livestock, dairy farming and poultry, having an important role in the poverty
reduction, received 11% of the total disbursement as against the target of 8%.

The Committee expressed the hope that the banks would take necessary steps
to further accelerate the pace of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector during
the next six months so that the full year target of Rs.130 billion should be achieved
comfortably.

Dr. Shamshad Akhtar while expressing satisfaction over the handsome growth
in disbursement of credit to the agriculture sector stressed upon the banks to formulate
long term vision and strategy to develop agriculture finance as a business line. She
said that the sector promises opportunities for diversification, attractive returns both to
the banks and the economy, and has enormous growth potential as the existing
outreach of institutional credit to the sector is just 15% of the total potential market of
about 6.6 million rural households. She said that a strategy would be developed in
consultation and collaboration with the banks and other stakeholders to increase the
outreach of institutional credit to 50% or 3.3 million rural households during the next
3-5 years as envisioned by the Committee in its last meeting held in July 2005.

She also emphasized upon the provincial governments to ensure speedy
issuance of passbooks to the farmers to enable them to avail bank credit.

Clarification on Foreign Currency Accounts Rules 2020

On 6th October 2020, the Federal Government issued Foreign Currency Accounts Rules, 2020 under
the provisions of Protection of Economic Reforms Act, 1992. There has been no change in the general
or special permissions given by the State Bank to individuals under the foreign exchange regulations.
According to paragraph iv, Chapter 6 of the Foreign Exchange Manual, foreign currency accounts can
be fed by remittances received from abroad, travelers’ cheques issued outside Pakistan and
encashment of securities issued by Govt. of Pakistan. A foreign currency account of a citizen of Pakistan
resident in Pakistan can also be fed with cash foreign currency only if the account holder is a filer as
defined in Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.

The recently issued rules aim to provide a regulatory framework for the operation of individual foreign
currency accounts. Such a framework represents a continuation of the State Bank of Pakistan’s efforts
to strengthen the foreign exchange regime and make it more market-oriented. Looking ahead, SBP will
continue to take steps to facilitate greater use of banking channels for individuals to meet all their
foreign exchange needs.

exchanged from the field offices of SBP BSC and branches of banks till the close of banking
hours on 31st December, 2012, the statement added.

Ministry of Finance and State Bank of Pakistan introduce risk-sharing mechanism to
support bank lending to SMEs and small businesses to avail SBP’s Refinance Facility to

Support Employment

 

Taking cognizance of the SMEs finding difficulties in arranging adequate collateral and banks’
risk averseness in taking exposures for such lending under the SBPs Refinance Scheme to
Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers, Ministry of Finance has stepped forward
to shoulder risk sharing with banks. Accordingly, the Federal Government has allocated Rs30
billion under a credit risk sharing facility for the banks spread over four years to share the
burden of losses due to any bad loans in future. Under thisrisk sharing arrangement, Federal
Government will bear 40% first loss on principal portion of disbursed loan portfolio of the
banks. This facility will incentivize banks to extend loans to collateral deficient SMEs and small
corporates with sales turnover of upto Rs2 billion to avail financing under SBP refinance
scheme.

Under the SBP’s Refinance Scheme to Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers
due to the impact of COVID-19, businesses that commit to not lay off workers in the next
three months can avail credit through banks for the three months of wages and salaries
expenses at a concessional markuprate.

The risk-sharing mechanism being introduced today, that is expected to increase the banks’
incentive to lend to SMEs and small corporate under this scheme, was developed on the basis
of feedback received from relevant stakeholders and in collaboration between MOF and SBP.
Ministry of Finance’s swift approval ofthe subsidy to provide risk coverage to banks has made
it possible for the SBP to launchthis credit risksharing facility for which relevant circular has
been issued today.

SBP will continue to monitor the implementation of the scheme.

Governor SBP launches Digitization of FX Regulatory Approvals

Dr. Reza Baqir launched the SBP FX Regulatory Approval System (RAS) for end-to-end digitalization of
Foreign Exchange (FX) related case submission process today in a ceremony held in Karachi. At the
invitation of Governor Bagir, Dr. Ishrat Husain, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Institutional Reforms and
Austerity and the Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) gave the keynote speech at the event.

The objective of this initiative is to provide a fully digitalized platform to the business community and
individuals in approaching banks for their foreign exchange related requests. The initiative will transform
FX operations by replacing the paper-based requests with electronic submissions, which is not only efficient
but also cost effective. This development is also congruent with the Government of Pakistan’s vision of
Digital Pakistan.

Welcoming the audience, Deputy Governor State Bank Mr. Jameel Ahmad gave a brief overview of SBP’s
Knowledge Management Program to digitalize the decision-making processes at the State Bank. Deputy
Governor informed that all FX related transactions create cross border monetary and reputational
exposures for both the businesses and country and need to be well managed to avoid any unwarranted
risks. He shared with the audience that in order to address this issue, remove inherent problems related
to paper based processes and ensure timely delivery of services to the stakeholders, SBP has developed
this online platform under the umbrella of its ‘Knowledge Management System’.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan in his speech referred to various steps taken by State Bank of Pakistan
towards digitalization at the State Bank and in the banking industry and for enhancing ease of doing
business in the country. He informed that SBP has worked with various public and private sector entities
for providing alternate delivery channels for payments. He also mentioned that work of micropayment
gateway is at advance stage, which would revolutionize the payment spectrum in the country.

Sharing his vision on foreign exchange front, he highlighted that in order to further liberalize the foreign
exchange regime, SBP has taken several steps. It expanded the delegation of FX related requests to banks.
It includes providing ease in payments for acquisition of services from abroad by one-time registration of
contract with SBP and remittance of all subsequent payments by the banks, payments directly through the
banks for acquisition of services from digital service providers up to US $ 200,000/- per year without any
approval from SBP. It also includes registration of Foreign Currency Loans from abroad acquired by the
private sector by the banks, and facilitating exporters by allowing them to make shipments on ‘Open
Account Basis’ with direct dispatch of documents to the importer while complying with certain conditions
related to historical performance on export proceeds realizations.

In the end, he also mentioned that End-to-End digitalization of process through the commercial banks’
portals will enable customers to lodge their FX related requests from the location of their convenience
thereby sparing their valuable time previously spent in navigating the paper-based processes. Governor
Baqir appreciated the work of SBP officers as well as bank Presidents and officers for making this
digitization possible as well as several other recent schemes of the SBP to support the economy during
COVID-19

Joint Press Release of SBP and Pakistan Embassy, USA

 

Governor SBP shares initiatives of SBP to connect Non-Resident Pakistanis financially with their
homeland in a Webinar organized by Pakistan Embassy in USA

 

 

The Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, said that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is fully
committed to facilitating overseas Pakistanis to remain financially connected with their homeland. He was
speaking to Overseas Pakistanis in a webinar organized by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington D.C.

Welcoming the Governor, the Ambassador of Pakistan to the U.S., Dr. Asad M. Khan, highlighted that
the Government attaches highest importance to serving the Pakistani American diaspora, who play a
crucial role in Pakistan’s national development. In this regard, he mentioned that the Government had
taken a number of steps to facilitate Pakistanis living abroad. He noted the significant role played by
Pakistani American community, which is the third largest contributor of remittances to Pakistan. The
Ambassador further added that the Embassy and its Consulates General across U.S. remain in close
contact with the Pakistani American community to regularly brief them on developments back home
and to explore avenues for cooperation. In this context, the Ambassador mentioned that today’s
webinar offered a unique opportunity for the Pakistani diaspora to directly interact with Governor State
Bank and his team and to share their views and feedback. He thanked Governor for taking this initiative
and sparing time to engage with the diaspora and educate them about the Government’s efforts to
make banking transactions easier for its citizens and community living abroad.

While briefing the audience about the state of the economy, the Governor remarked that the decisive
measures taken by the State Bank and the government before the COVID-19 pandemic had helped address
the balance of payments crisis that the new government had inherited. In turn, these bold steps had placed
the economy ona stronger footing, helping to provide room for policy action to combat the pandemic. He
discussed the various measures taken by SBP and the Government during the pandemic to safeguard
common people and businesses. He expressed confidence about the recent resumption of economic
activity as COVID-19 cases have receded significantly thanks to steadfast actions by the government and
lockdowns have been eased in the country. Looking ahead, he was confident that the economy would
resume along the path of stability and recovery on which it had made strong progress before the
pandemic.

Elaborating the efforts of SBP for facilitating overseas Pakistanis, Dr. Baqir said that SBP is focusing on
facilitating them by providing a secure and efficient financial system through digital means. He outlined
SBP’s commitment to a digital financial ecosystem, that would feature efficient and secure payment and
banking systems in the country. Elaborating further, he said that SBP and the Government are actively
working for further facilitation of overseas Pakistanis by increasing their access to financial markets of
Pakistan. In particular, SBP is working for facilitation of home remittances, increasing investment in
Pakistani capital markets, industry, real estate and fulfilling the life style needs of non-resident
Pakistanis. In this context, he was excited about the recent launching of the Roshan Digital Account by the
PM.

The Deputy Governor (Policy) of the State Bank, Dr. Murtaza Syed, gave a detailed presentation on the
Roshan Digital Accounts to the participants. He informed that for the first time in Pakistan’s banking
history, Non-resident Pakistanis (NRPs) have been provided an opportunity to remotely open bank
accounts in Pakistan entirely through digital means without visiting a bank in Pakistan or an Embassy or a
Consulate office. The facility has been initially launched through 8 Pakistani banks. SBP would continue to
add other banks in the list in future.

The Deputy Governor highlighted that Roshan Digital Accounts can be opened in Pak rupee and a number
of foreign currencies, which offer complete life style banking solution to account holders through digital

Islamic banking industry constitutes 7.3 percent of
overall banking system in Pakistan: Kamran Shehzad

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said
that the Islamic banking industry at present constitutes about 7.3% of the overall banking
system in Pakistan.

Addressing the closing ceremony of a five-day Training Program on Islamic Banking
which was jointly organized by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and Islamic Research and Training
Institute (IRTI) at the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), Islamabad today, he
said the Islamic banking industry since its re-launch in 2001 has gradually increased its share in
the market.

He said that there are 5 full-fledged Islamic banks and 12 conventional banks having
Islamic banking branches with a network over 840 branches in more than 70 districts across the
country. He noted that the Islamic banking industry has maintained strong growth momentum
with over 30 percent average annual growth during the last 6-7 years.

The Deputy Governor observed that the growth trend in Islamic banking industry is
likely to gather further momentum with increasing awareness level and expansion of Islamic
banking network in second and third tier cities of the country.

Mr. Kamran Shehzad said that the strong growth momentum witnessed by the industry
in Pakistan could be attributed, among others, to the key role played by the State Bank of
Pakistan in providing an enabling environment. ‘The State Bank has been at the forefront of
almost all the initiatives that have been taken to help develop and promote the industry’ he
added.

Besides developing a supportive regulatory and supervisory framework, the SBP is
actively engaged in promotion and training and capacity building of the Islamic banking
industry, he said. ‘To address the awareness and misconception issues, we have launched an
awareness campaign whereby targeted seminars and conferences are being organized for
business community, academia, bankers and policy makers throughout the country. Further, a

SBP advises banks to ensure availability of
PRISM fund transfers facility at their branches

In order to facilitate the general public for prompt fund transfers through Pakistan
Real-time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
has advised all PRISM participating banks to take immediate necessary actions for
ensuring availability of PRISM fund transfers facility at their branches from 9:00 am
till 3:00 pm on working days, Monday till Friday. Using this facility, a customer can
send Rs. 100,000 or above.

The participating banks have also been advised to create awareness among general
public about the usage of this facility through advertisements in print media and by
printing of brochures and displaying signboards / banners at prominent locations in

branches.

PRISM participants will report actions taken in this regard to Payment Systems

Department (PSD) on monthly basis.

The decision has been taken in the backdrop of low utilization of PRISM facility for
real time large value fund transfers by the general public. Various reasons may be
attributed to the low utilization, like non-facilitation of bank’s branch staff, lack of
awareness about this channel and non-implementation of Straight Through Processing

(STP) functionality between PRISM and banks’ core banking systems.

It may be recalled here that one of the Strategic Goals of SBP, under its Strategic Plan
2016-2020 is to develop a modern and robust payment system to provide efficient,
secure and low cost payment services to the general public. Enhancing the usage of
PRISM for large value fund transfer services for general public will contribute towards
achieving this goal.

State Bank releases Second Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its Second Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s
Economy for FY19. As stated by the report, the effects of macroeconomic stabilization measures taken
since December 2017 started to unfold as the economy moved into the second quarter of FY19. More
specifically, monetary tightening along with exchange rate adjustments, reduction in development
expenditures of the federal government and regulatory measures helped contain domestic demand,
which is visible from a marked slowdown in imports. This together with deceleration in external
demand, underperformance of major kharif crops, and moderation in the fixed investment loans, led
to notable deceleration in economic activity. Meanwhile, inflation continued to increase, mainly due
to cost-push factors and some persistence in underlying demand pressures.

According to the report, average headline CPI inflation rose to 6.5 percent during Q2-FY19 — the highest
quarterly inflation since Q1-FY15, when global crude oil prices were around USS 100 per barrel. This
trajectory was largely dictated by its core component, non-food non-energy (NFNE), which further
gathered momentum as the pass-through of exchange rate depreciation and second round impact of
high oil price accentuated its already elevated level.

Moreover, the report highlighted that the fiscal deficit continued to stay high despite a sharp cut in
development spending since the beginning of FY19 and is undermining the efforts to contain domestic
demand. While revenue collection declined, current expenditures increased.

Regarding the external sector, the report observed that there was an improvement in the current
account deficit due to decline in imports and a marked increase in workers’ remittances during the
review period. However, exports were generally affected by a slowdown in international demand.
Also, net financial inflows were lower than last year, leading to a drop in SBP’s FX reserves.

The report contains a special section which evaluates the fiscal burden of state-owned enterprises in
the power sector. Recommended measures include a move towards more effective, apolitical
collection process; investment in the transmission and distribution network; and creation of a national
level consensus towards the formulation of a coherent energy sector policy.

The report features another special section on the importance of human capital in the context of CPEC.
The analysis takes stock of the country’s existing human capital and the employment opportunities set
to arise in the near future as CPEC enters its next phase focusing on industrial special economic zones
and agriculture. It then assesses just how prepared the domestic workforce is to capitalize on these
opportunities, and provides a roadmap to address the associated skill-deficit.

In the big picture, the report underscores the need to step up investments in human capital and
technology. This will boost productivity and increase exportability of the country’s goods, services and
skilled labor, and allow it to generate FX in a sustainable manner.

SBP provides exporters an increased limit of Rs190 billion

In order to further facilitate the exporters, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the limit of
refinancing provided to the banks under Exports Finance Scheme (EFS) by Rs100 billion. Hence, banks
will now have overall limits of Rs700 billion for the exporters for FY21. Moreover, to promote export-
oriented investment, Rs90 billion have also been allocated under Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF)
for the FY 21.This amount is in addition to limit of Rs100 billion already allocated to banks/DFls under
Temporary Economic Relief Facility (TERF) - a concessionary refinance scheme for setting up of
industrial units.

Export Finance Scheme and Long Term Financing Facility are two of the oldest schemes of SBP under
which concessionary financing is provided to the exporters. EFS is operational since 1973 to meet short
term financing needs of exporters, while LTFF has been available 2008. For both the schemes, their
Shariah compliant versions are also available.

Since the emergence of Covid-19, SBP has taken several measures to counter its impact on the economy
and safeguarding country’s exports has been a key priority. SBP has provided a number of relaxations
under EFS and LTFF since March 2020 including:

1. Additional period of six months for making shipment against loans availed under EFS Part-I.

2. Additional period of six months for meeting required export performance against loans
availed under EFS Part-ll. The export performance of this extended period will also be
considered for calculating the entitlement limit for FY21.

3. Reduction in showing export performance from 2 times to 1.5 times against financing availed
during FY20 and FY21.

4. Relaxation in the eligibility criteria for availing finance under LTFF.

5. Allowing deferment of principal amount for one year and/or rescheduling/restructuring of
loans under LTFF.

It is expected that with the above already provided relaxations, which were widely appreciated by
business community; above enhancement of around Rs190 billion in limits will cater to exporters’
cheaper liquidity requirement. SBP is closely monitoring the situation and is ready to take any further
actions required to support the export sector.

New Data Centre to tackle money laundering and
terrorism financing at Financial Monitoring Unit

Tracking down money laundering and terrorism financing will now be easier thanks to a new high
tech data centre that was inaugurated by the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the British High
Commissioner and the Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) at
the Financial Monitoring Unit in Karachi on Friday the 10” of February 2017.

This new, state of the art, integrated data centre for anti-money laundering and countering terrorism
financing was established with the financial assistance of the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) and support of UNODC. The centre is going to host a specialist analytical suite of
software (goAML) developed by UNODC. It will enable the Financial Monitoring Unit to automate
collection and analysis of suspicious financial transactions being received from banks, exchange
companies and other reporting entities in Pakistan. Moreover the integrated system will enhance the
capability of FMU in disseminating financial intelligence to designated law enforcement agencies in
an efficient manner.

Previously, analysis of financial data at the autonomous Financial Monitoring Unit was undertaken
manually which was slow and vulnerable to oversights. Now, the customised software and high
precision equipment installed in the new data centre will allow the Financial Monitoring Unit to
analyse suspicious transactions and currency transactions in a more robust, sophisticated and
automated manner. This centre will greatly enhance FMU’s capacity to generate more meaningful
financial intelligence with the prospect of identifying, prosecuting, and deterring a greater number of
criminals and terrorists operating in the country.

The Governor of the State Bank said:

“lam confident that FMU’s Data Centre will strengthen its ability to generate better financial
intelligence which would help our law enforcement agencies in successful investigations and
prosecutions of money launderers and terrorism financers.”

Mr. Thomas Drew CMG, British High Commissioner said:

“The UK Government is proud to have supported the establishment of the Financial Monitoring Unit’s
data centre, as part of the Pakistan Government’s wider commitment to tackle financial crime. This is
a great step forward by Pakistan to meet its international obligations and close the space for money
laundering and terrorism financing in the country.”

The Representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Mr Cesar Guedes said:

“The launch of the data centre at FMU today and its future utilisation for the goAML system
supported by the UNODC will be recorded as a significant step taken for the People of Pakistan to
build a transparent, just, and fair society in which suspicious financial transactions and financing of
terrorism are monitored, deterred and prevented.”

The Director General for the Financial Monitoring Unit, Syed Mansoor, said:

“The fusion of this hard and soft technology is ready to give FMU the edge that we required, and with
the assistance of our reporting entities, FMU will disseminate financial intelligence with a lot more
substance, which will eventually assist our LEAs in successful conclusion of investigations”

PKR -USS exchange rate adjusts 3.1 percent in the interbank market

Today, the PKR-USS exchange rate in the interbank market has depreciated by 3.1 percent from Rs
104.90 per USS yesterday to Rs 108.25 per USS.

While almost all macroeconomic indicators have been showing encouraging picture, such as decade-
high real GDP growth, increase in investment, credit expansion to private sector, and subdued
inflation; the deficit in the external account has been rising for some time. Accordingly, the exchange
rate adjusted in the market and SBP is of the view that this depreciation in the exchange rate will

address the emerging imbalance in the external account and strengthen the growth prospects of the
country.

SBP also believes that the current exchange rate is broadly aligned with the economic fundamentals.
SBP will continue to closely monitor the developments in the foreign exchange markets and stands
ready to ensure stability in the financial markets.

SBP issues revised Prudential Regulations for Consumer Financing

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has revised the Prudential Regulations for Consumer Financing
with an aim to promote consumer financing in sustainable and fair manner while ensuring
financial stability of the banks/DFIs. The revised regulations provide more discretion in
decision making to banks/DFls in line with their dynamic business environment.

It may be mentioned here that SBP periodically reviews its regulatory framework in order to
align it with changing business environment and international best practices.

Under these regulations, amongst others, banks/DFIs are advised to develop common
glossary of Important Terms and all banks will use these important terms in their loan
documentation. The development of common nomenclature of Important Terms will not only
complement the disclosure requirements of terms & conditions but will also facilitate the
general public to better understand the terms of the loans and perform a meaningful
comparison of the financing products offered by different banks.

Banks/DFIs have also been advised to initiate assessments for introduction of differentiated
loan pricing in all consumer financing products, which inter-alia should be sensitive to loan
product characteristics, borrowers’ risk assessment, timely regular repayments and
exemplary behavior

Banks/DFls maintain general provision against performing consumer financing portfolio to
protect them from the risks associated with the economic cyclical nature of this business. The
revised regulations introduce tiered base general provision requirement linked with gross
non performing loan ratio (GNPLR) of the banks/DFlIs. The regulation aims to incentivize
banks/DFlIs which have lower GNPLR and promote better risk management practices.

Banks/DFls have been allowed six months time to achieve compliance with new or revised

regulations.

SBP takes notice of skimming incidences—relevant
Bank to compensate fully its customers.

During the preceding week, State Bank of Pakistan noted with concern that customers’ information on
debit cards of Habib Bank Limited was compromised by hackers through skimming to create its clones
and were used to withdraw depositor’s money from various locations within and outside the country.
Since then SBP has been in contact with HBL management to ascertain the losses, returning of money
to the affected customers and precautionary measures to limit the impact of this hacking activity.

HBL has taken several immediate actions to determine and limit the impact of such transactions on
customers. Specifically, it blocked all identified debit cards that were suspected to be misused and
quarantined the Automated Teller Machines (ATM) used in hacking activity. Till today, 296 customers
have confirmed the disputed transactions and the estimated damage assessment done to the concerned
Bank is Rs10.2 million for their customers. HBL has also managed to start returning the money to
depositors to the extent of their losses. Meanwhile efforts are underway to determine losses to any
other bank’s customers using HBL ATMs and take remedial measures.

ATM skimming — an illegal activity in which account details are stolen from the magnetic strip
contained on the back of the debit card has been around for a while and such incidents have happened,
sporadically, in Pakistan as well. To safeguard the depositors from fraudulent transactions, SBP has
issued specific regulations for the security of payment cards and internet banking, under which banks
are required to develop and implement comprehensive framework for risk assessment, implementation
of controls and monitoring.

It would be pertinent to mention here that debit cards with a magnetic strip on its back — that stores
customer’s account details are particularly vulnerable to skimming and cloning. Debit cards,
complying with EMV (Europay Mastercard Visa) standards, featuring a chip and offering two factor
authentication are now considered most effective countermeasure for card cloning through skimming
globally. Accordingly, SBP vide its circular PSD 05 of 2016 issued regulations for Payment Cards
Security wherein banks are required to develop infrastructure for EMV Compliance and issue cards by
30th June 2018.

SBP reassures bank’s customers that complying with its responsibility of ensuring a smooth and safe
payment systems it will take every measure in coordination with banks to safeguard the interest of
depositors against any fraudulent activity.

Monetary Policy Statement
January 28, 2017

The average inflation clocked in at 3.9 percent during the first half of the year, lower
than the earlier projections due to smooth supply of perishable items, stable exchange
rate, and government's absorption of the impact of higher international oil prices. The
current trends suggest that the actual inflation would be lower than the target rate of 6
percent in FY17.

Growing CPEC-related imports, decline in exports, absence of Coalition Support Fund,
and slowdown in remittances, pushed the current account deficit to USD 3.6 billion in
the first half of FY17, from USD 1.7 billion in the same period last year. This higher
deficit was financed by an increase in bilateral and multilateral funding along with pick
up in investment flows. Overall surplus in the balance of payments stands at USD 0.2
billion in the first half of the current year. Going forward, with the aforementioned risks
to the external sector, the need of financial inflows would grow further.

A sizeable net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and an increase
in bank deposits helped increase private sector credit. Benefiting from the historic low
interest rates, private businesses are actively borrowing from the banking sector for
upgrading and expanding their business processes. Private sector borrowed Rs 375
billion in first half of FY17 as compared to Rs 282.6 billion availed in the corresponding
period of last year. Loans for fixed investments increased by Rs 134.1 billion in the first
half of FY17 compared with an expansion of Rs 83.8 billion in the same period of last
year. Demand for consumer financing, especially for auto loans, also gathered pace
during the first half of the year.

Healthy credit expansion, along with higher production of Kharif crops, visible
improvements in energy supply, and upbeat business sentiments signal recuperating
real economic activities. Large-scale Manufacturing grew by 3.2 percent during the first
five months of the current fiscal year and further increase is expected on account of
growing infrastructure spending and recent policy support for export oriented sectors.

Based on an assessment of the above developments and after detailed deliberations, the
Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 5.75
percent.

Governor SBP inaugurates Polyculture Forest and Museum Laboratory

Governor SBP Dr. Reza Baqir inaugurated the Polyculture Forest at Pakistan Security Printing
Corporation (PSPC) Karachi. He was briefed about the project in detail by the management. The
Polyculture Forest is inspired by the incumbent government’s priority of encouraging people,
communities, organizations, businesses and civil society to collectively plant trees and thus play their
part in improving climatic conditions.

The PSPC Polyculture Forest project envisages a 5,000 square meters of “urban forest”, where about
15,000 saplings of 45 indigenous species will be planted using the “Miyawaki” Method that involves
planting dozens of native species in the same area. The Miyawaki approach ensures rapid growth of
plants; reportedly, plant growth is 10 times faster and the resulting plantation is 30 times denser than
usual; moreover, the forest becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. A mini lake for the
project has also been developed to complement the Forest ecosystem and support aquatic life - plants,
fish and other creatures. The project also involves micro-sprinkler irrigation system, which supplies only
the required amount of water directly to the roots of trees. When fully mature, PSPC Polyculture Forest
would be absorbing 300-350 tons of CO2 per year. The forest’s additional benefits include providing a
natural habitat and food for various species of birds, mammals, and insects; a lowered temperature of
the surrounding areas due to natural air-conditioning impact of the trees; recharge of ground water
table; prevention of soil erosion, etc.

In his brief address on the occasion, the Governor stated that as part of State Bank and PSPC’s
contribution towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals and care for the Environment, the
PSPC Polyculture Forest, a green island in the urban concrete jungle of Karachi, is a gift for the entire
community. Furthermore, he appreciated the efforts of the entire PSPC team, especially to the
numerous members, who worked day and night, even during the pandemic and made this innovative
project a reality.

Later, the Governor inaugurated SBP Paper Conservation Laboratory. After the inauguration, he
conducted the tour of the facility and appreciated the work done by the staff.

Established under the Division of Archives & Record Management, Paper conservation lab is unique in
the country, since objects at the Archives/ record management/ Museum of SBP are exceptional in
terms of history, emotional import, and technology; as such, the work aimed at their conservation is
extremely important. The laboratory will be the repository of the permanently valuable records of SBP,
which have been determined to have continuing historical value and/or require preservation for legal
or fiscal reasons. The other aspect of the preservation is digitization of all the records in collaboration
with ITD, SBP, through Knowledge Management system.

For in-depth analysis and conservation of precious records places the SBP at the vanguard of country’s
efforts to safeguard its important heritage and history. The conservation facilities at the laboratory
include paper conservation, which is highly technical job, preserves the paper for another 100 to 200
years, fumigation chamber, binding and unbinding facility, Dust vacuum of files with high tech dust
chamber and vacuum/freeze drying chamber.

SBP PROHIBITS BANKS/DFIs FROM FINANCING
PREMIUM ON PURCHASE OF CARS

The State Bank of Pakistan has, with immediate effect, prohibited the banks
and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) from financing premium charged by the
car dealers and/or investors over and above the ex-factory tax paid price set by the car
manufacturers. This step taken by the State Bank will not only discourage the
speculators and curb the menace of premium (or on-money as it also called), but will

also facilitate the genuine buyers of new cars.

In order to discourage speculation in the real estate, the State Bank had earlier
restricted the banks/DFIs, under their mortgage/house financing schemes, from
extending financing solely for the purchase of plots/land. Similarly, with a view to
curb speculative activities on shares, the State Bank had earlier also prescribed limits

on bank/DFI’s investments in shares listed on the Stock Exchanges.

The State Bank’s circular (BPD Circular No.2 of 28th January, 2005)
regarding prohibition of financing of premium on cars issued to the Banks and DFIs is

enclosed.

SBP issues guidelines on prevention against cyber attacks

State Bank of Pakistan has issued guidelines on prevention against cyber attacks. Through
these guidelines, the SBP has advised banks/MFBs/DFIS to continuously improve their cyber
security controls and procedures so as to anticipate, withstand, detect, and respond to cyber
attacks.

SBP’s cyber security instructions provide guidelines in the areas of risk ownership and
management responsibility; periodic evaluation and monitoring of cyber security controls;
regular independent assessment and tests, and industry collaboration and contingency
planning

The new instructions require the Board of Directors (BoD) of the institutions to regularly
evaluate the adequacy of cyber security systems and action plans with regard to emerging
cyber threats. The senior management is required to ensure that an organizational plan of
action for cyber security management exists in each institution and is regularly reviewed and
updated for implementation.

It may be noted here that cyber threats have become a global phenomenon and are
continually growing in sophistication and impact, despite the advances in cyber-security
technologies and practices.SBP has always proactively strived to provide an enabling
regulatory framework in order to cope with new threats.While the new technologies and
their application in banking system has created new opportunities for the efficient and cost-
effective delivery of services, these have also posed a number of new threats and risks.

The banks/DFls/MFBs are required to make necessary arrangements to comply with the
instructions latest by December 31, 2016.

State Bank holds SAARCFINANCE Seminar on Internal Audit

State Bank of Pakistan hosted a seminar on ‘Internal Audit: Emerging Challenges and Effective
Practices in Central Banks’ under the aegis of SAARCFINANCE Forum at National Institute of Banking
and Finance, Islamabad during 27-29 March 2019. Besides Pakistan, officials from SAARC central

banks participated in the event.

Mr. Qasim Nawaz, Executive Director, SBP inaugurated the seminar. While addressing the inaugural
session, he stated that until a few years back, business process reengineering was at the core of
innovation in banks. While advancements in technology have further transformed the horizon of
financial services, these innovations are also raising challenges of their own. Adding further, he stated
that the Board and the senior management of State Bank are cognizant of the need to align its
internal operations to the changing environment, and to promote innovation in the financial sector in

a regulated environment.

Mr. Horst Simon, the keynote speaker of the event, discussing technological risks faced by business
around the world, highlighted the importance of risk culture inculcated within the organization. He
emphasised on the roles and responsibilities of board, senior management and the employees to

maintain a robust risk management mechanism.

The seminar was also addressed by Mr. Zayeem Bin Alam, Senior

Manager of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Mr. Zayeem discussed the risks of cyber security, social media, data privacy and third party risks and

offered an IT auditor’s perspective of how to address those risks by discussing controls.

Syed Sohail Javaad, Director Payment Systems Department shared the on going developments
aboutdigital payments, their importance, evolution, the benefits of disruptive technologies to
regulators, the emerging risks and appropriate responses to them from the perspective of internal
audit. Apart from these speakers, the delegates of the central banks also presented their country

papers for the information of the audience.

Economy maintains its growth momentum, says SBP report

 

The growth in real GDP remained at its upward trajectory, and increased to a decade-high of
5.3 percent in FY17, noted by State Bank of Pakistan’s third quarterly report on the State of
Pakistan’s Economy released today. Economic indicators like private sector credit and
investment also posted encouraging picture, whereas inflation remained below the target.

The Report also highlighted the revival in the agriculture sector during FY17, which was
supported by favorable policy measures, including subsidy on fertilizer, reduction in sales tax on
tractors, and increased access to finance. Better agriculture had, in turn, positive spillover for
trade and manufacturing sectors, argued by the Report. Further, PSDP and CPEC-related
activities also continued to boost construction related industries.

The overall improvement in business sentiments along with supportive policies (historic low
interest rate, high infrastructure spending and better law and order) has encouraged a number
of firms to pursue expansion plans, as observed by the SBP Report. This was reflected in a
significant surge in private sector credit off-take during FY17, with a sizable share of fixed
investment loans. At the same time, an increase in machinery imports was also noted.

The Report also mentions the decline in exports and worker remittances, which along with the
increase in imports led to a higher current account deficit as compared to the last year. On the
financing side, the official external inflows in Jul-Mar FY17 stood around the same level as last
year, while both FDI and FPI inflows increased. Although SBP’s FX reserves declined during this
period, these are sufficient to comfortably finance more than four months of imports.

Regarding fiscal situation, the Report observes an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.9 percent of
GDP during Jul-Mar FY17. The expenditure side of the fiscal operations remained well-managed
with a contained growth in current expenditure and a robust growth of about 15 percent in the
development expenditures. However, growth in tax revenues remained less than the target.

The Report also underscores the importance of sustainable levels of current and fiscal accounts
in order to maintain the prevailing growth momentum, and hard-earned economic stabilization.

Governor SBP shares with Chambers of Commerce the measures to enhance utilization of Risk
Sharing Facility under SBP’s Rozgar Scheme

In order to improve utilization of Risk Sharing Facility under SBP ROZGAR scheme, Governor SBP, Dr.
Reza Baqir, held an online meeting with the Presidents of Chambers of Commerce and Industries of the
15 regions where SBP(BSC) offices are located.

At the outset, the Governor highlighted that facilitation of business community is a priority of the
central bank particularly for its ongoing measures taken to combat the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
He briefed the participants about the SBP major refinance schemes for payment of wages and salaries
to prevent layoffs and relief package for the deferment of principal amount and restructuring of loans
and their progress. The Governor shared the data on these measures giving details on the financing
availed by both corporates and SMEs under its Rozgar Scheme and the Risk Sharing Facility provided by
the government. As of 05th June 2020, banks have approved requests amounting to Rs. 21 billion for
SMEs and small corporate to support payment of salaries and wages to their workers and employees.

Governor Bagqir remarked that though the financing availed by businesses is encouraging so far, State
Bank is also cognizant of the fact that SMEs are facing difficulties in availing this facility from the banks
for various reasons. To address such issues and to facilitate the SME borrowers, Governor Baqir
announced an elaborate arrangement of focal persons devised by SBP. He said that SBP has created
teams of focal persons of SBP-BSC Chief Managers and senior officials of all the banks in all the 15 cities
where SBP (BSC) offices are located. These teams will primarily be responsible to address issues faced
by businesses in availing the financing under SBP Rozgar scheme in all the cities of the country clubbed
in to 16 groups. They will liaise with Chambers of Commerce and other trade bodies to listen to their
suggestions as well. The details of these teams are available on the SBP website at:

www.sbp.org.pk/sbp-fp.pdf
www.sbp.org.pk/banks-fp.pdf

Businesses can extend their queries or complaints to the SBP focal persons, who will resolve issues with
the help of Bank’s focal persons.

Dr. Reza Baqir shared with the chambers that SBP is also contemplating to extend the scheme further
as it understands that the businesses are still facing challenges due to impact of COVID-19 on daily lives
of common people. He assured that SBP stands ready to take every possible measure under its
mandate that can facilitate the businesses to overcome the difficulties faced by them

Banks surpass annual agri. credit disbursement
target during last fiscal year

Banks have surpassed the agri. credit disbursement target for the last fiscal year (2011-12) by
extending loans amounting to Rs 293.8 billion to agriculturists which is 8.8 billion (103 percent of annual
target) more than the indicative target of Rs 285 billion set by the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee
(ACAC) for the whole fiscal year. It is 11.7 percent higher than Rs 263 billion disbursed in 2010-11.

Five large banks collectively disbursed agri. loans amounting to Rs 146.3 billion or 103.7% of their
annual target (Rs 141 billion) in fiscal year 2011-12, higher by 4.3% as compared with Rs 140.3 billion
disbursed during the preceding fiscal year (FY2010-11). National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Habib Bank Limited
(HBL), MCB Bank, Allied Bank Limited (ABL) & United Bank Limited (UBL) have surpassed their annual targets
by achieving 106.0%, 103.5%, 103.3%, 102.8% and 100.7% disbursement respectively. Zarai Taraqiati Bank
Limited (ZTBL) disbursed Rs 66.06 billion or 94.2% of its annual target of Rs 70.1 billion while Punjab
Provincial Co-operative Bank Limited (PPCBL) by disbursing Rs 8.5 billion or 112.1% has surpassed its annual
target (Rs 7.6 billion) during FY 2011-12.

Fourteen Domestic Private Banks as a group achieved 112.5% of their target (Rs 54.1 billion) by
disbursing agri. loan of Rs 60.9 billion. The Bank of Khyber, Bank Al Habib, Faysal Bank, Soneri Bank, NIB Bank
and Askari Bank have surpassed their annual agri. credit disbursement targets by achieving 174.6%,
147.6%,136.7%,132.4%,104.1% and 100.4 % disbursement respectively while other remaining banks could
not meet their annual targets.

Five Microfinance Banks as a group disbursed agri. loans of Rs 12.1 billion or 99.3% of their annual
target of Rs 12.2 billion during FY 2011-12.

It may be pointed out here that the banks had been missing the agri. credit disbursement targets
since 2008-09. Achievement of agri. credit disbursement target during the year ended June 2012 was
extremely difficult in the backdrop of continuous declining trend in the overall Private Sector Credit and high
agri. Non-performing Loans (NPLs) of major banks due to devastating floods of 2010 and heavy rains of 2011
in Sindh province. However, SBP adopted a multipronged strategy and made all out efforts in achieving the
target of Rs 285 billion allocated by ACAC. The efforts of SBP officials not only helped banks in achieving their
target but also surpassing it. These efforts included swift settlement of crop loan insurance claims, close co-
ordination with provincial revenue departments to facilitate the One Window Operation in agri. intensive
districts for timely completion of revenue formalities, holding of farmers’ awareness and financial literacy
programs at grass root level, and follow up of targets with the top management of banks and their agri.

Heads. The contribution by SBP BSC field offices in monitoring the regional targets was also greatly helpful.

State Bank of Pakistan allows Electronic Warehouse Receipt as collateral for bank
financing

As a major move towards addressing the challenge of access to finance to farming
community, State Bank of Pakistan has amended its Prudential Regulations of Agriculture
Financing, SME Financing, and Corporate & Commercial Banking by allowing banks to accept
Electronic Warehouse Receipts as collateral for lending against storage of agriculture
produce and commodities.

Warehouse Receipt Financing (WHRF) is a mechanism whereby farmers, traders and
processors may avail financing facility from banks while collateralizing their produce and
agricultural commodities as a security stored in accredited warehouses. WHRF would benefit
small farmers who usually find it difficult to access credit from banks due to non-availability
of agricultural land as collateral. Further, WHR financing would provide liquidity to
commodity market and help in improving food security and price stability.

The State Bank of Pakistan and Government are proactively seeking innovative methods and
measures to improve institutional financing to agri-sector and rural population, particularly
the small farmers. For this purpose, Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), in
consultation with key stakeholders including the State Bank of Pakistan, notified the
Collateral Management Companies (CMC) Regulations 2019 on July 31, 2019, under the
Companies Act 2017 to promote warehouse receipt financing and electronic trading of
agricultural commodities. Under these regulations, any private entity can form a collateral
management company which would accredit warehouses to store agricultural commodities
and issue warehouse receipts eligible for banks loans.

It is expected that the development of a collateral management and warehouse receipt
system would improve access to formal credit, reduce the losses arising from wastage of
agricultural commodities after harvest, increase farmers’ profitability due to better price
discovery and reduce risks of banks by allowing agricultural commodity as an alternate
collateral. Going forward, this system would also facilitate trading of agricultural
commodities at commodity exchanges opening new business avenues in national and
international commodity markets. Further, development of the entire eco system would
encourage investors to set up warehouses of high standards for which State Bank’s refinance

scheme for setting up storage facility is already available.

SBP launches consultation on Banking on Equality Policy — an initiative to increase financial
inclusion of women in the country

In order to address one of the key challenges hindering economic growth of Pakistan to its full potential,
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has launched a national dialogue on its forthcoming policy to reduce the
gender gap in financial inclusion. Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor SBP hosted a webinar titled “Launch of
Consultation on Banking on Equality policy: Reducing the Gender Gap in Financial Inclusion” on
Monday, December 21, 2020. The webinar featured an exclusive panel discussion around women’s
financial inclusion with international thought leaders in the area of gender and finance including
Princess Zahra Aga Khan, Director Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN); Ms. Ceyla Pazarbasioglu,
Director of Strategy, Policy and Review Department, IMF; and Dr. Reza Baqir Governor, SBP. Dr. Anita
Zaidi, President of Gender Equality at Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation moderated the discussion.
Deputy Governor SBP, Ms Sima Kamil made a presentation on the state of women’s financial inclusion
in the economy and shared the features of the Banking on Equality policy. The webinar was attended
by diverse local and international stakeholders representing public offices, international agencies,
banks and associations. In addition, nearly 1,000 people also watched the webinar live through social
media platforms.

Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, in his opening remarks said that improved gender parity in financial and
economic opportunities can enhance overall socio-economic development outcomes of a nation, for
not just the present but future generations. He noted that the event had three key goals. The first
objective was to bring attention to the shared goal of reducing the gender gap in women’s financial
inclusion. The second goal was to share the content of the Banking on Equality policy that was being
launched for consultation. Finally, the third goal was to get feedback from stakeholders on the policy
itself. He welcomed the feedback that was provided by the international participants and others that
would be provided over the course of next several weeks. He noted that central banks in developing
and emerging markets, where there are often market failures, have an important role to play in
ensuring that important sections of the society don’t get left out from benefitting from the financial
system through access to saving, borrowing, insurance and other financial products. He said that the
SBP looked forward to working with other domestic and international partners to further the cause of
improving women’s financial inclusion. In this context he also appreciated the support being provided
by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for helping advance SBP’s agenda on promoting financial
inclusion in Pakistan.

In her presentation Deputy Governor SBP, Ms. Sima Kamil, noted that the gender gap in financial
inclusion is rising. She noted that only 11.7 million, or 18% of the adult women, have active bank
accounts compared to 51% for men. Deputy Governor Kamil unveiled five key pillars of the Banking on
Equality policy under which actions are targeted towards improving institutional diversity, product
diversification and development capability, customer acquisition and facilitation approaches towards
women segments, gender disaggregated data collection, and prioritizing gender focus in SBP’s policies.
The policy recommendations will be applicable on all banks, microfinance banks, DFls and EMls.

Governor, SBP meets with Presidents / CEOs of Commercial Banks

Mr. Tariq Bajwa, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan presided his first meeting with the
Presidents/Chief Executive Officers of all commercial banks today at SBP, Karachi. The Governor
welcomed and thanked the representatives of banks for their participation in the meeting. In his
opening remarks, the Governor shared the vision of a regulatory body being ‘Fair’ and ‘Firm’ with
the regulated entities and communicated that these two themes would be the guiding principles
for future interactions with the banking industry.

Adding further, the Governor shared his priority areas of promoting agricultural financing,
facilitating SMEs’ in their access to financial services and enhanced focus on addressing the
disparities emanating due to limited financial intermediary role and very small footprint of the
banking industry in the province of Balochistan. The Governor emphasized upon the banking
sector to proactively play their due role for achievement of these objectives for the greater goal
of inclusive economic growth and employment generation. He further stated that with the
country’s available natural resources coupled with support from the banking sector in the shape
of adequate and targeted financing to small farmers, the agriculture sector offers tremendous
opportunities for achieving higher economic growth. He further observed that SME’s are the
backbone of the industrial sector. In Pakistan this is a neglected sector and the SBP along with
the commercial banks need to proactively work for the development of the SMEs. He also
showed his commitment to promote Islamic banking by committing to make efforts for resolving
the industry’s major issues including issuance of Government Sukuk for its liquidity
management.

Other issues discussed in meeting included rescheduling / restructuring of non-performing loans
of textile industry, facilitation to retail customers in provision of foreign exchange services at
banks’ branches, adoption of PayPak Cards, rationalization of banks’ charges related to Inter-
bank fund transfer facility, Cyber Security and Export / Import of foreign currency notes.

The CEOs / Presidents of banks congratulated the Governor on his appointment and committed
to work with SBP in the priority areas. They shared their views with the Governor on overall
economic situation; opportunities available and challenges faced by the banking industry and
further stated that they were looking forward to the cooperation of SBP and Federal Government
for resolution of those challenges.

In his concluding remarks, the Governor reiterated that SBP would continue its engagements
with banks on regular basis to identify, communicate and resolve challenges on priority basis

SBP outlines Criteria for recognition of

External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs)

The State Bank of Pakistan has outlined the eligibility criteria for recognition of
External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) for the purpose of implementing
Basel II in the country.

The criteria, which have been developed after due consultation with various stake
holders, will serve as a transparent policy document for evaluating and granting
recognized status to ECAIs. This policy document will serve as a benchmark on basis
of which the status of recognized ECAIs would be granted.

It may be pointed out that according to the roadmap for the implementation of Basel
II in Pakistan issued by the State Bank in March, 2005, banks/DFIs are required to
initially adopt Standardized Approach of the New Accord. Under this approach, the
capital requirement against credit risk is determined on the basis of risk profile
assessed by the External Credit Assessment Institutions (rating agencies) duly
recognized by the supervisory authority.

The criteria provide a basis for the evaluation and recognition of the rating agencies
that apply to SBP for eligibility for the purpose of Basel II. The Securities and
Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will continue to remain the supervisory /
licensing authority for credit rating companies in Pakistan and only those credit rating
companies that are duly licensed by SECP under the Credit Rating Companies Rules,
1995, will be eligible to apply to the State Bank for Basel II recognition. The credit
rating companies incorporated in Pakistan will also be required to follow the Code of
Conduct for Credit Rating Companies issued by SECP.

All rating companies that meet the eligibility criteria and are interested in getting
themselves recognized as ECAI for the purpose of Basel I, may apply to the Director,

Banking Supervision Department, State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi, Mr. Jameel
Ahmed by furnishing the required information / documents.

adie

The recognition shall mean that the banks can use ECAI’s risk assessment rating of
their portfolio for the calculation of capital requirement under Basel II.

The eligibility of applicant ECAI shall, interalia, be made on the basis of following:-

-- ECAI should have methodology of assigning credit rating that is rigorous,
systematic, continuous and subject to validation.

--The ECAI should be independent, free from economic or any external pressures that
may influence its credit assessment.

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
April 16, 2020

1. At its last meeting on 24» March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted the worsening
outlook for global and domestic economic activity in the wake of the Corona pandemic. Given the unfolding
situation, the MPC noted that it “remains ready to take whatever further actions become necessary in

response to the evolving economic impact of the Coronavirus.”

2. Since the last MPC meeting, the global and domestic outlook has further deteriorated. The world
economy is expected to enter into the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression, contracting by as much
as 3 percent in 2020, according to projections released this week by the IMF. This is a much deeper recession

    

o

an the 0.07 percent contraction during the global financial crisis in 2009. Moreover, there are severe risks of

 

a wotse outcome. In addition, global oil prices have plummeted further, with futures markets suggesting low
prices will persist. Domestically, high-frequency indicators of activity—including retail sales, credit card
spending, cement production, export orders, tax collections, and mobility data from Google’s recently

ntroduced Community Mobility Reports—suggest a significant slowdown in most parts of the economy in recent
weeks. On the inflation front, both the March CPI out-turn and more recent weekly SPI releases in April also

show a marked reduction in inflation momentum.

3. While there is exceptionally high uncertainty about the severity and duration of the Coronavirus shock,

the developments discussed above imply further downward revision in the outlook for growth and inflation.
The economy is expected to contract by -1.5 percent in FY20 before recovering to around 2 percent growth
in FY21. Inflation is expected to be close to the lower end of the previously announced 11-12 percent range

 

this fiscal year, and to fall to 7-9 percent range next fiscal year. While there are some upside risks to headline
inflation in case of temporary supply disruptions or food price shocks, these are unlikely to generate strong
second-round effects due to the weakness of the economy. Similarly, the inflationary impact of the recent
exchange rate depreciation is expected to be contained given low import demand and falling global prices.

4. In light of this reduction in growth and inflation expectations, the MPC decided at its emergency meeting
today, to cut the policy rate by a further 200 basis points to 9 percent. This reduces forward looking real
interest rates (defined as the policy rate less expected inflation) to around zero, which is about the middle of
the range across most emerging markets. The MPC was of the view that this action would cushion the impact
of the Coronavirus shock on growth and employment, including by easing borrowing costs and the debt
service burden of households and firms, while also maintaining financial stability. It would also help ensure
that economic activity is better placed to recover when the pandemic subsides.

5. The MPC highlighted that this rate cut would complement other measures recently taken by the SBP to
support the economy, including concessional financing to companies that do not lay off workers, one-year
extension in principal payments, doubling of the period for rescheduling of loans from 90 to 180 days, and
concessional financing for hospitals and medical centers incurring expenses to combat the Coronavirus
pandemic.

SBP and ROZEE.PK join hands to impart free of cost financial literacy
education

National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y), a project of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP),
and Rozee.pk have partnered to impart free of cost financial literacy education to Pakistan’s youth
through an engaging and interactive game called ‘PomPak — Learn to Earn’.

PomPak delivers its lessons in English and Urdu language through a story-based game format
designed to help understand and apply principles of financial literacy. Users follow the story of two
entrepreneurial families as they tackle personal, financial, and business decisions. As the player of
this game, the aim is to help the families create a successful business. In just a couple of hours, users
can master the essentials of saving, budgeting, borrowing, and banking, among many other topics.

venues are closed around the country and remote learning has increased significantly, the youth of
Pakistan may take advantage of their free time and gain the much needed financial literacy training
through this game which will help them to understand financial matters.

Anyone who completes the course would be awarded with a Certificate of Financial Literacy. This
digital certificate is jointly issued by the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), a
subsidiary of the SBP and National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y).

National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLPY) aims to impart essential financial education to
Pakistani youth and school going children for strengthening their money management skills and
understanding of the financial matters. NFLP-Y is expected to serve as a medium to connect youth
with financial institutions that offer banking products and services.

SBP calls meeting of Bank Presidents on Naya Pakistan Housing Program

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Dr. Reza Baqir called a meeting of Banks today for
deliberations on the measures proposed by Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority
(NAPHDA) and identify way forward to ensure sustainable market-led financing of housing projects
and mortgages. The meeting was chaired by the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, and attended by
Chairman NAPHDA, Lt. General Anwar Ali Haider, and members of the think tank formed by the
government including Mr. Shaukat Tareen, Mr. Arif Habib and Mr. Aqeel Karim Dhedhi among others.
Banks were represented by their respective presidents. Governor Baqir at the outset praised the work
of Lt. General Anwar Ali Haider and NAPHDA for its significant potential contribution in meeting the
shortage of housing in the country and accelerating economic activity in the country.

Governor Baqir said that housing finance has not only remained under-developed in Pakistan as
compared with other emerging economies but seen little progress over time. In this regard,
therefore, this initiative is of great national interest. He emphasized that the construction and
housing sectors have strong linkages with the rest of the economic sectors and offer a commercially
viable and long term business proposition for banks. He also stressed that supporting economic
activity in these sectors would support economic growth and particularly employment in current
times of economic stress. He encouraged banks to view housing and construction finance as an
opportunity to broaden their balance sheet and cater to the huge financing needs of the sector.
Governor Bagqir reiterated central bank’s commitment to play a facilitative and supportive role while
also supporting a healthy credit culture in the country.

Chairman NAPHDA made a presentation to the banks on the key features of Naya Pakistan Housing
Program. He shared the details of the underlying development model for the successful
implementation of the initiative. Complementing the presentation, Mr. Shaukat Tarin, member of the
government’s think tank, presented a financial model and elaborated the incentives being offered by
the government and emphasized that these will make the financing of developers and mortgages
commercially attractive for banks.

The presidents of banks in their deliberations appreciated the Naya Pakistan Housing Program and
expressed their readiness for participating in this initiative of national importance. They also made
queries and suggestions in this regard. It was decided that banks, NAPHDA, and SBP would work
together to prepare an overall roadmap and execution plans with support from the relevant sub-
committees of Pakistan Banks Association.

Government making headway towards

improving its finances: SBP First Quarterly Report

Recent fiscal figures show that the government has been making some headway towards improving its
finances. The budget deficit for the first quarter of FY12 was 1.2 percent of GDP, compared with 1.5 percent during
the same quarter last year, says State Bank’s First Quarterly Report on the State of the Economy released today.

It said that this reduction in the budget deficit was caused primarily by 29.7 percent growth in FBR
revenues, on the back of increased tax collection efforts and higher revenues from imports. Non-tax revenues also
recorded impressive growth of 50.4 percent, it added.

However, on the basis of seasonal trend in FBR revenues, the amount collected up to end-Dec 2011, falls
short of the amount needed to meet the annual target of Rs 1,952.3 billion, it said, adding that meeting end-year
revenue targets would also depend upon the realization of CSF and sale of 3G licences (around Rs 150.0 billion), in
absence of which, it would be difficult for the government to contain the fiscal deficit within its annual target.

The Report said that the federal government has budgeted a surplus of Rs 125.0 billion on part of
provinces, however, due to 52.8 percent increase in their expenditures, provinces managed only Rs 11.6 billion
surplus up to Q1-FY12, which was 85.7 percent lower than the corresponding period last year. ‘Any short fall in
the contribution by the provinces would make achievement of the fiscal deficit target more challenging’, the
Report cautioned.

According to the Report the lack of external funding has put the burden of financing the deficit
disproportionately on the banking system, which has led to crowding out of private sector and is acting as a
disincentive for banks to perform their role of financial intermediation.

Government borrowing from the banking system up to end-Nov 2011 was Rs 736.8 billion, against Rs
336.1 billion in the corresponding period last year. This amount includes Rs 391.0 billion borrowed from banks to
retire PSE debt, which has now been transferred on to the government’s books, it said, adding that unfortunately,
PSEs continue to hemorrhage as a credible restructuring plan has not been put into action. As a result circular debt
issue is likely to persist, the Report said.

The Report said the government’s efforts to keep its borrowing from SBP in check during the initial
months of FY12, helped in keeping demand-driven inflationary pressures at bay, which was supplemented by the
easing of food prices. As a result, YoY CPI inflation declined to single digit (9.7 percent) in December, 2011 after
remaining in double digits for the last two years. While the increase in energy prices, recent weakening of Pak
Rupee and the base effect may increase inflation in the coming months, the end-year average inflation is likely to
fall close to 12.0 percent as projected earlier, the Report added.

While SBP has shown its willingness to relax its policy to support the private sector as it did in July and
October, 2011, it cannot add to the stress on the economy arising from weaknesses in other sectors. The most
recent policy decision to keep the policy rate unchanged was influenced among others, by the weakness in
external accounts during Q1-FY12, the Report observed.

It said that Pakistan was fortunate in FY11 that its current account ended up in a surplus and, despite the
drying up of FDI and other foreign investments; there was a net increase in its FX reserves. ‘Given the rigidities in
the trade account and the vulnerability of the financial account, sustaining this performance in FY12 was always
going to be difficult. Nevertheless, the pace at which the current account deteriorated during the first quarter of
FY12 took many by surprise. Specifically, the current account deficit for Sep 2011 alone was over USS 1.0 billion,’
the Report added.

Work on design of commemorative coin for late Edhi underway on instructions of prime minister

The work on design of Rs. 50 commemorative coin in memory of late Abdul Sattar Edhi has been
started. The decision to issue commemorative coin was taken by the federal government and Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif had accorded its approval in the cabinet meeting held on Friday, July 15, 2016.
The federal government will decide the final design of the coin. Governor State Bank of Pakistan
announced this decision on the instructions of Prime Minister in a condolence gathering held at SBP
Karachi for late Mr. Edhi.

The issuance of a commemorative coin, among other steps taken by the government and other
organizations, will keep memories of the late philanthropic personality in our history. It is just a token
to acknowledge late Edhi's services to the humanity. The governor of State Bank of Pakistan
emphasized, ""Those nations who honour their heroes create examples and legacy for their work to be
continued in the future generation.”

State Bank of Pakistan would like to thank all those representatives of social sector, civil society,
financial industry and philanthropists who attended the commemorative gathering to remember the
outstanding services rendered by late Abdul Sattar Edhi for orphans, widows and destitute of the
country.

Earlier, SBP had arranged a ‘condolence’ gathering to pay tributes to late Abdul Sattar Edhi who
served the needy, the orphans and the downtrodden and whose services have been recognized
locally as well as internationally. Speakers remembered late Edhi for filling the void of lack of social
welfare services in the country and laying foundation of a sound organization to serve the humanity.

SBP Governor meets Pakistan Business Council,
highlights positive in the economy

Governor SBP, Mr. Tariq Bajwa has said that recovery in exports that started in the second
half of FY17 and continued in the current fiscal year bodes well for country’s economy.
“Exports have shown positive growth during the last six months”, he elaborated adding, “In
fact, during the last three months, exports have grown by 13.2 percent, which shows that
the decline in exports seems to have finally reversed”.

He was addressing to a delegation of Pakistan Business Council that called on him and the
senior management at SBP headquarters today.

Governor SBP said the data of first two months of the current year points to recovery in
key external indicators, particularly remittances, exports and FDI. “Workers’ remittances
grew by 13.2 percent to US$ 3.5 billion in Jul-Aug 2017 and inflows from all major
corridors were higher as compared to Jul-Aug 2016.

Mr. Bajwa elaborated that the country’s economy is increasingly becoming attractive for
investment with continuation of supportive economic policies. “I believe at this juncture, it
offers a lot of opportunities for businesses to grow and expand”, he said.

The Governor said that the pace of expansion in the economy accelerated for the third
consecutive year in FY17 amid improving security situation and better energy supply. It
grew by 5.3 percent in FY17, compared to 4.6 percent last year. The growth was not only
the highest during last ten years but also broad-based. All the three major sectors -
agriculture, industry, and services - contributed to acceleration in growth.

Mr. Bajwa pointed out that the accommodative monetary policy has played a key role in
providing boost to private sector credit demand. Policy Rate has come down from 10
percent in October 2014 to only 5.75 percent. Historic low interest rates were
instrumental in taking the private credit growth of 16.8 percent in FY17, over and above
11.2 percent a year ago.

The overall expansion in private credit stood at Rs 747.9 billion during FY17.
“Remarkably”, said the Governor, “About 40 percent of the expansion in credit was meant
for fixed investment”. On the supply side, a healthy deposit growth improved the liquidity
of the banking system.

The latest data shows the trends in private sector are continuing in FY18. A much lower net
retirement in private sector credit of Rs 75.5 billion from July 1st to September 1st 2017

SBP ISSUES FRESH BANKNOTES WORTH Rs. 161 BILLION ON EID UL AZHA 2016

To meet the increasing demand for fresh banknotes on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha 2016, SBP Banking
Services Corporation (SBP BSC) made elaborate arrangements with a focus to cover maximum
stakeholders including the general public. The SBP issued fresh banknotes of Rs.161 billion as
compared to Rs.116 billion issued on previous Eid-ul-Azha. This included lower denomination notes
(up to Rs.100) of Rs.20 billion and higher denomination banknotes (Rs.500 and above) of Ra.141
billion, which is meant for heavy payments & ATM needs of commercial banks.
To ensure maximum issuance, all 16 field Offices of the SBP BSC issued fresh notes to the general
public from its counters before Eid ul Azha. In addition to this, the commercial banks were also issued
lower denomination fresh bank notes worth Rs. 18.0 billion to disburse the same to the public and

SBP aims to provide basic banking services
to every adult in Pakistan: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said the central bank aims to
provide basic banking services to every adult and bankable citizen in Pakistan. ‘As a large portion of
our population has access to mobile phones, we feel that if a workable partnership between the
banking and telecom sectors continues, we shall see our dreams come true,’ he added.

Delivering his keynote address at the 5” International Conference on Mobile Banking in
Pakistan at a local hotel in Karachi today, he said that mobile phone subscription has seen an
explosive growth in Pakistan — total subscription now reaches to 112 million customers in all income
segments of the society, and growth continues rapidly.

He, however, observed that banking accounts are owned by approximately 25 million
customers, in a population of 180 million, largely belonging to high income segments while there
are about 7 million borrowers. He pointed out that Pakistan has one of the lowest financial
penetration levels in the world with 56% of the adult population totally excluded, and another 32%
informally served.

Mr. Anwar said that SBP will continue to play its role in promoting an environment which is
conducive for financial innovation. ‘At the macro level, we will continue to work with the industry
and the other regulators to promote a sound, safe, efficient and inclusive mobile commerce
ecosystem,’ he added.

He said: ‘On this front, we are already working closely with Pakistan Telecommunication
Authority (PTA) and have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for enabling the
Interoperability Framework where all banks and telecom companies can join hands to serve the
customers. We are also in the final stages of formulating the regulatory framework for
interoperable mobile banking system.’

Interoperable systems are essential to mass adoption of mobile commerce, he said, adding
that at present, financial institutions and telecom companies can choose whatever business model
suits their needs i.e. One-to-One or One-to-Many. ‘Let me assure that all the existing and the
prospective One-to-One or One-to-Many arrangements between banks and the Telcos would not
be affected with the proposed regulatory framework,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said that SBP is keen to work with different stakeholders including financial
institutions, different regulators, private sector, application developers and telecom companies to
provide an enabling environment for the creation of mobile commerce ecosystem in the country.

However, the common challenge is to ensure that all banking transactions, irrespective of
the technology platform, are cost effective, efficient, and pose the lowest risk for the consumers, he
said, adding that this requires close coordination among the stakeholders in the area of regulations
especially monitoring, licensing, provision of technological infrastructure and ensuring maximum
benefits for consumers.

Monetary Policy Statement
January 31, 2019

Economic data released after the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in November
2018 confirms that the stabilization measures implemented during the last twelve months are
taking hold. Key monthly indicators are showing visible signs of deceleration in domestic demand.
The current account deficit is narrowing, albeit gradually. This, along with an increase in financial
inflows are contributing to reduced pressures on the country’s external accounts. These
developments are encouraging and have served to reduce some economic uncertainty. However,
challenges to Pakistan’s economy persist: (a) despite narrowing, the current account deficit
remains high; (b) fiscal deficit is elevated; and (c) core inflation is persistently high. This situation
calls for continued consolidation efforts.

Average headline CPI inflation stands at 6.0 percent for the first half of FY19, which is considerably
higher than the 3.8 percent recorded during the same period last year. Meanwhile, headline YoY
inflation has shown some moderation during the last two months, primarily due to a sharp fall in
prices of perishable food items and a downward adjustment in prices of petroleum products. The
impact of these developments has also been captured in the recent IBA-SBP’s consumer confidence
survey, which indicates some moderation in households’ inflation expectations. Despite these
positives, core inflation as measured by non-food-non-energy components of the CPI basket has
reached 8.4 percent in December 2018. Going forward, the second round impacts of the exchange
rate movements, upward adjustments in gas and electricity tariffs, and higher government
borrowings from SBP are likely to be offset by the lagged impact of the increase in policy rates and
the fall in international oil prices, on inflation. Accordingly, the projected range of inflation remains
unchanged at 6.5 to 7.5 percent.

The pickup in inflation and the continuation of economic challenges are taking their toll on
economic performance. Real economic activity has witnessed a marked slowdown during the first
half of the year. Large-scale manufacturing, which has strong backward and forward linkages, saw a
net contraction of 0.9 percent during the first five months of this fiscal year, mainly due to a
moderation in domestic demand and some sector specific challenges. Meanwhile, all major kharif
crops have recorded a decline in production from last year’s levels. The initial assessment of the
wheat crop is also not encouraging. Both, the direct and the knock on, impacts of changes in
commodity producing sectors on the services sector, is likely to reduce real GDP growth for FY19 to
around 4.0 percent, well below both the annual target of 6.2 percent and the 5.8 percent growth
realized in the previous year.

Credit to private sector (CPS) saw a net expansion of Rs 570.4 billion during Jul-Dec FY19, which
was almost double the level of expansion during the same period last year. This growth is largely
attributed to higher cost of raw materials (cotton, petroleum products, etc), continuation of
capacity expansion in power and construction-allied industries (especially cement and steel), and
favorable liquidity conditions due to retirement of government borrowing from commercial banks.

SBP releases Third Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy

 

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Third Quarterly Report FY20 on ‘The State of Pakistan’s Economy’
today. According to the report, successful stabilization measures that had fostered macroeconomic
improvement in Jul-Feb FY20 provided a valuable cushion against the downturn faced from late March
2020 onward in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, major progress had been made during
Jul-Feb FY20 period in curbing the fiscal and current account deficits on the back of strong revenue growth,
policy shift to a market-determined exchange rate, and build up in foreign exchange reserves buffers.
Following this period of necessary stabilization, there were also encouraging signs of recovery in the real
economy, including exports. This made the economy relatively better equipped to respond to any
external shocks than it would have otherwise been. This pre COVID-19 strengthening of Pakistan’s
fundamentals and the prudent policy response to the outbreak later on should leave Pakistan well-placed
to resume its earlier trajectory of recovery once the pandemic subsides.

As in other parts of the world, the real, fiscal, and external sectors came under visible strain thereafter as
COVID-19 struck the global economy, while the inflation outlook improved as a result of weaker domestic
demand and lower oil prices. The scale of the COVID-19 shock is underscored by the fact that for the first
time in 68 years, as per the provisional estimates, Pakistan’s real GDP growth is set to contract in FY20. At
0.4 percent, this contraction is not as severe as that expected in most parts of the world due to COVID-
19.

The report emphasizes that the estimated contraction in GDP owes mainly to a decline in industrial and
services sector activities. The large-scale manufacturing (LSM) posted an improvement during Jan-Feb
2020, driven primarily by exporting sectors with some contribution from food and fertilizer segments.
However, this nascent recovery was derailed by COVID-19 related disruptions, with LSM growth falling 22
percent on a month-on-month basis in March. The agriculture sector emerged largely unscathed by
COVID-19 as important crops registered a turnaround compared to last year. That said, unfavorable
climate conditions and pest and locust attacks prevented some annual targets from being met. The
services sector felt the impact of COVID-19 acutely, as evident from high frequency data and negative
sectoral growth is expected in FY20.

The report documents a similar pattern in the fiscal sector, where a primary budget recorded a surplus
during Jul-Mar FY20 on cumulative basis, the first ever since 2016. However, it turned into a deficit during
the third quarter due to COVID-19. On the one hand, the lockdown created a drag for revenue, with
growth in all categories of FBR revenues turning negative in March 2020. On the other hand, the induced
slump in economic activity and rise in unemployment created a need for greater expenditures. The
government announced a Rs 1.24 trillion stimulus package towards the close of Q3-FY20, consisting of a
combination of targeted handouts and sector-specific outlays for agriculture, construction, and exports.
While this package is expected to give much-needed relief to individuals and businesses, it would
simultaneously contribute to a larger fiscal deficit in the near term.

Governor SBP visits Pakistan Security Printing Corporation

The State Bank of Pakistan acquired the banknotes and prize bonds printing functions of Pakistan
Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) from the Federal Government in June 2017.Today, the Governor
Mr. Tariq Bajwa visited the PSPC for the first time where he was apprised about its functions in detail by
its management. He was also briefed about the printing process of currency notes and shown the
premises. While addressing the gathering of PSPC employees, he appreciated the hard work of its
employees in timely discharge of duties.

The Governor said that being the sole issuer of banknotes in the country SBP gives utmost importance to
the integrity and quality of banknotes along with its timely supply in the system. In order to have full
control over the process of banknotes manufacturing and issuance, the SBP deemed it necessary to
acquire the banknotes and prize bonds printing function of PSPC. “This is in line with the global and
regional trends as a number of central banks including Central Bank of France, Turkey, Italy, Australia,
India and various other central banks have their own banknotes printing facilities,” he said.

Governor further added that given the increasing need of currency notes due to expanding economy
and launch of new saving schemes, PSPC will have additional responsibilities in coming years. “To
accomplish these tasks in a befitting manner”, said the Governor, “We will have to determine the
quantum, quality and supply of banknotes, with good coordination of SBP Finance Department, SBP BSC
and PSPC. For that, we should have long- and short-term plans and set milestones”, he said.

Mr. Bajwa stated that manpower is the key to an efficient institution. Its skills and capacity determine
the pace of progress. “We will have to evaluate the existing manpower of PSPC and arrange for
harnessing its potential. Moreover, in view of the increasing needs of the Corporation, we will have to
hire new talent”, he remarked.

He said that modernity implies acquisition of new technology and strengthening the research and
development function. Modern technology not only facilitates the execution of functions but also is a
must for efficiency. We will have to assess the system and upgrade it. “Modern printing machinery will
be required for enhancing the printing capacity and improving the quality of banknotes. Besides PSPC
will have to join hands, with SBP BSC and SBP’s Finance Department to strength the research and
development function”, he concluded.

Deputy Governors Mr. Riaz Riazuddin and Mr. Jameel Ahmad and other senior officials also
accompanied the Governor. MD PSPC, Mr. Haroon Rasheed and other senior officials received the
Governor while MD National Security Printing Company, Mr. M. Misbah Tunio, MD Sicpa Inks Pakistan
(Pvt) Ltd Mr. Asif Ikram and Member PSPC Board Mr. M. Tanvir Butt were also present on the occasion.

Demonetization of All Old Design Banknotes

As per Federal Government’s Gazette Notification dated 4"" June, 2015, the old design banknotes will
cease to be legal tender with effect from 1'December 2016. Therefore, it has now been decided to
phase out all remaining old design banknotes of Rs 10, 50, 100 & 1000. The Rs 5 banknote and the old
design Rs 500 banknote have already been demonetized.

It is worth mentioning that the State Bank of Pakistan issued a new design banknote series which
started with the issuance of Rs 20 denomination banknote in 2005 to improve the security, durability
and aesthetic quality of banknotes. The process of issuance of complete series of new design
banknotes comprising eight denominations (Rs 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000) was

State Bank allows clearinghouse membership to CDNS

In order to facilitate the general public, SBP has allowed clearinghouse membership to
Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS).

State Bank has issued instructions to all the banks to accept profit coupon / withdrawals slips
pertaining to Pensioners Benefit Account (PBA), Behbood Saving Certificate (BSC) and Saving
Account (SA) of CDNS. The investors can now deposit these instruments directly into their
bank accounts, located anywhere in Pakistan. These instruments will be cleared by CDNS
through NIFT. Upon receipt of successful clearance from National Savings, banks will then
credit respective accounts of such investors.

This initiative will enable the investors of CDNS to receive profit/credit directly into their
accounts maintained with their banks which would serve as proficient and a safe mechanism
for the general public.

It may be recalled that prior to clearing house membership of CDNS, its investors had to
personally visit National Saving Centers (NSCs) to receive their monthly profits. This was
source of inconvenience for the investors, especially widows and senior citizens, who waited
in long queues to receive their profits.

State Bank’s support to the initiative was in line with its strategic objective to develop a
modern and robust payment system to provide efficient, secure and low cost payment
services to the general public under SBP Strategic Plan 2016-2020.

State Bank issues ‘Guidelines for Clearing Operations’ to facilitate general public
for timely realization of funds in their accounts

 

To facilitate general public for timely realization of funds in their bank accounts and ensure
consumer protection, State Bank has issued ‘Guidelines for Clearing Operations’ for compliance by
Clearing House (s) and its members (banks and microfinance banks) involved in clearing of Pak
Rupee payment instruments. The guidelines, which will be effective from Jan 1, 2018, have been
issued in terms of the powers conferred upon State Bank of Pakistan under the Payment Systems

and Electronic Fund Transfers Act, 2007.

In this regard, banks/microfinance banks have been advised to credit the customers’ accounts
within the timelines as defined in the Guidelines and in case they fail to do so they are obliged to
compensate the customers for the delayed period (except the force majeure events declared and
communicated to customers). Banks/microfinance banks have also been advised to make
arrangements for centralized clearing of their intercity instruments through their designated
branches in cities where they are present to reduce the clearing time due to physical movement of

instruments.

Further, in order to timely resolve customer complaints, dispute resolution mechanism with
turnaround time has also been prescribed for banks/microfinance banks. In addition, all
banks/microfinance banks have also been advised to disclose the cut-off time for presentment of
payment instruments, timelines to credit the customers’ accounts, and the roles, responsibilities

and liabilities of customers with respect to collection and clearing of payment instruments.

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
September 21, 2020

1. At its meeting on 21% September 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the
policy rate unchanged at 7 percent. The MPC noted that compared to the time of the last meeting in June
2020, business confidence and the outlook for growth have improved. This reflects the decline in Covid-19
cases in Pakistan and the easing of lockdowns, as well as the timely stimulus provided by the Government
and SBP. At the same time, the forecast for inflation has risen slightly, primarily due to recent supply side
shocks to food prices. Average inflation is now expected to fall within the previously announced range of 7 —
9 percent during FY21, rather than marginally below.

2. ‘The MPC noted that financial conditions continue to be accommodative with real interest rates
remaining slightly below zero on a forward-looking basis. In addition, the series of targeted measures
undertaken by SBP since the Covid-19 outbreak have injected significant liquidity and further lowered
funding costs for many businesses and households. Together, these monetary measures have injected an
estimated stimulus of Rs. 1.58 trillion, or about 3.8 percent of GDP, in the cash flow of businesses and
households. In addition, the government has undertaken a number of significant measures to support
economic activity including the Ehsaas emergency cash program, commodity financing, a risk-sharing facility
for SMEs, and acceleration of tax refunds.

3. ‘Taking into account the changes in the outlook for inflation and growth since the last MPC and the
impact of the stimulus measures undertaken by the Government and SBP, the MPC was of the view that the
stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to provide needed support to the emerging recovery, while
keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability.

4, In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Real sector

5. Following a deep contraction between March and June, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) index
returned to expansion in July, growing at 5 percent (y/y). High-frequency demand indicators including auto
sales, cement dispatches, POL sales, and electricity consumption also reflect an encouraging pick-up in
economic activity. Nonetheless, the economic recovery remains uneven across industries, with the hospitality
and certain services sectors especially lagging, and the level of activity generally still remains below pre-
Corona levels. Going forward, growth is projected to recover to slightly above 2 percent in FY21, after falling
to -0.4 percent last year. The recovery is expected to be driven mainly by manufacturing-related activities and
construction, which are being supported by various financial policies from SBP including the Temporary
Economic Refinance Facility (https://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL20.htm) and the

 

government’s incentives for the housing and construction sectors. The growth outlook is subject to
uncertainty. On the downside, risks include a potential second wave of Covid-19 domestic infections, a
possible sharp increase in infections in the winter months in Pakistan’s major export markets in Europe and
the US, and the threat to agriculture from locust attacks. On the upside, a faster global recovery could lift
exports higher.

Press Release
25 July 2015

SBP Policy Rate unchanged at 6.5 percent

1. Improvements in macroeconomic indicators led SBP to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy stance and slash the policy rate by a cumulative 300 bps in FY15. The key
factors facilitating the decisions can be pinned down to a sharp decline in CPI inflation,
along with its benign outlook, and improvement in external account. In addition to this,
narrowing of fiscal deficit and continuation of Extended Fund Facility (EFF) improved the
market sentiments. These developments also led to an upgrade of Pakistan’s sovereign
ratings by international rating agencies in recent months. Macroeconomic stability thus
achieved should reflect positively on real economic activity going forward.

2. Following its declining trend in nearly every month of FY15, average CPI inflation came
down from 8.6 percent in July FY15 to 4.5 percent in June FY15. Some recent
developments such as lagged impact of monetary easing in FY15, expected higher
monetary expansion in FY16, bottoming out of inflationary expectations,’ and the base
effect of historically low inflation during the second half of FY15 might suggest slight
deviation in the disinflationary trend of FY15 going into FY16. However, there is no major
change in SBP’s previous inflation forecast.

3. There is a possibility of upward revision in energy tariffs in FY16 and an adverse impact of
floods on production of perishable food items going forward that could have an upward
pressure on inflation. Meanwhile, projections of high oil production and weak global
demand suggest that international oil price might not have bottomed out yet. Given the
recent behavior of Pakistani CPI inflation amid falling international oil prices, this could
result in keeping inflation on the lower side.

4. While GDP growth in FY15 at 4.2 percent was slightly higher than that of FY14, it
remained lower than the target. In particular, industrial sector missed the target due to
lower growth in Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) and electricity generation; however,
the activities in construction and mining and quarrying remained buoyant. Agriculture
sector despite some losses to major crops from untimely and heavy rains did mange to
record some improvement. Noticeable increase in growth, as in the previous few years,
came in the services sector.

* As indicated in IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey of July, 2015.

Global experts share experiences of financial inclusion in a joint workshop
organized by State Bank of Pakistan and the Embassy of Sweden

Islamabad: Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and the Ambassador of
Sweden, Ms Ingrid Johansson co-hosted a one day workshop on the topic of “Financial and Social
Inclusion through Mobile Money and M-Commerce” in Islamabad. International experts from Sweden
shared their experiences for digitizing the payment landscape in Sweden, Peru and Rwanda for
enhanced financial and social inclusion. The event had participation from public sector officials from
related ministries and departments.

In his opening remarks, Governor Wathra said that as policy makers we must adopt inclusive
approaches while developing policies and infrastructures that can offer equal opportunities to all to
enhance social and financial inclusion. He said that Pakistan has made significant efforts to make
financial markets more inclusive and SBP has been on the forefront to develop an inclusive digital
financial services ecosystem in Pakistan where mobile money can be utilized for basic financial
services such as funds transfers, bill payments, retail payments and access to credit. SBP issued the
Branchless Banking regulations in 2008 and since then, Branchless Banking has witnessed tremendous
growth.

He shared that SBP’s efforts for promotion of financial inclusion have been yielding noteworthy
results. Today, Pakistan is considered as one of the fastest growing markets for branchless banking
due to its innovative policy approach which has helped catalyze business models and technological
innovations to build banking channels for low income households.

H.E. Ingrid Johansson, Ambassador of Sweden to Pakistan said that the Swedish government is
supportive of public and private sectors collaborating for innovations. Later, a presentation was given
by Dr. Niklas Arvidsson to highlight the path of Sweden’s evolution from Cash driven to Cash-lite
society through digital financial services which started in 1960. He said that though Sweden has made
significant progress towards digitization of payments, it is still expected that it cannot become a
cashless society before 2030. State Bank of Pakistan also shared the progress of creating
interoperable digital services, and the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. It was stressed that
Interoperability cannot be exclusive and a collaborative approach can lead to develop a uniform
digital platform that can facilitate financial and social inclusion. Experts from Ericsson also gave a
presentation for the participants about experiences of other countries such as, Rwanda, and Peru,
who have achieved effective digitization of payments to advance social and financial inclusion, to
create a cashless society.

Concluding the workshop, Syed Samar Husnain - Executive Director SBP thanked the Swedish
Ambassador for establishing the collaboration and co-hosting the session possible. He thanked the
experts for their detailed presentations and the participants for attending the event.

The workshop was attended by senior representatives from federal and provincial ministries and
departments including PTA, NADRA, SECP, Pakistan Post, and Ministries of Finance, Commerce,
Augaf, Information and Technology.

Book on corporate governance is an invaluable addition on the subject: Governor SBP

Honorary Consul General of Finland and Corporate Governance Specialist Ms.Sadia Khan called on
Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and presented her edited work titled,
""The Corporate Governance Landscape of Pakistan”. The book contains narratives by the pioneers of
corporate governance in the country for the benefit of those who will take it to the next level of
policy advocacy and enforcement. The book is yet to be launched for general public.

Governor SBP appreciated the efforts of Ms. Khan and hoped the book will be an invaluable addition
on the subject of corporate governance for future regulators, educators and practitioners besides a
source of guidance to present managers and CEOs.

The foreword of the book is penned by Dr. Ishrat Hussain, the former Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan who commended Ms. Khan for her hard work in bringing different expert views at one place
and filling the gap on much needed knowledge about corporate governance. The book provides a
comprehensive guide to the policy framework, principles, and practices of corporate governance in
Pakistan. It also attempts to capture the essence of corporate environment in Pakistan on the eve of
the introduction of the first Code of Corporate Governance. The edited work of various contributors is
mainly divided into three parts in the book titled Policy Framework: Laying the Foundation of
Corporate Governance; Towards Greater Responsibility, Accountability, and Transparency and
Practical Application: Implementing in Letter and Spirit.

Ms. Khan has more than twenty years of value driven leadership experience across Asia, Europe and
the USA. A graduate from Cambridge University, Yale University and INSEAD Business School, she has
worked with various international institutions and local regulatory authorities, including the Asian
Development Bank in the Philippines, the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the
State Bank of Pakistan.

PRESIDENT’s VISIT TO STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

President General Pervez Musharraf visited the State Bank head-quarters in Karachi this morning
to seek a briefing from the Governor, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar. This was his first visit to the State
Bank since the Governor took charge on January 2"", 2006.

During his visit, the President shared his views with the SBP top management officials, on the
strong economic performance of the country. While commenting on macroeconomic stability, he
stressed that the gains to the economy will only be meaningful when they are translated into a
better life for the common man. He said that sustained economic growth can alleviate poverty in
the country through an enhanced access to the poor to microfinance, agriculture credit and SME
finance.

Commenting on the high trade deficit, he talked about the enhanced prospects of increasing the
country’s export earnings to US $ 18 billion in order to reduce the trade deficit. He indicated that
the tax revenue collections are set to exceed the target of Rs 800 billion by the end of this fiscal
year to reach Rs 850 billion, though he recognized that there is a need to further strengthen the
tax to GDP ratio.

While giving her views on State Bank’s future vision and strategy in the briefing to the President,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar mentioned that the State Bank of Pakistan is well on its way to
implementing second-generation reforms both in the financial sector, and within SBP, in terms of
strengthening governance standards and modernizing it in line with international best practices.

In her presentation, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar covered the areas of monetary policy, management of
foreign exchange reserves, commercial banks’ profitability, improved access to underserved
markets to development finance, promotion of financial robustness and stability, development of
electronic banking and information technology and the need to continue to strengthen governance
issues within the central bank.

The Governor laid great emphasis on the fact that the State Bank, in its efforts to strike a balance
between its dual objectives of controlling inflation and promoting economic growth, works in
close alliance with the macroeconomic goals of the Government.

While highlighting the process of formulation and implementation of monetary policy, Dr. Akhtar
pointed out that the tightening stance of recent months has largely been effective in bringing
inflation down, and that the central bank will continue to monitor liquidity conditions in the
market very closely in order to keep inflation in check. She also mentioned that the conduct of
monetary policy tends to be quite complicated when the money supply grows at a pace faster than
nominal GDP as this gives rise to inflationary pressures, and in doing so the contribution of
government borrowing from the central bank has a major role to play, and needs to be checked.

When talking about Commercial Banks’ profitability, the Governor pointed out that 80% of the
banking sector now belongs to the private sector, and that commercial banks have had record
profits during 2005, which emanates from improved management of the banking sector, though it

Monetary Policy Statement
November 24, 2017

The latest information reveals that economic activity is strong as corroborated by broad-based pick up in
industrial output, gains in factors supporting production of major crops, and growth in private sector
credit. This implies that the prospects of achieving 6.0 percent target of real GDP growth continue to be
strong. Model-based projections for inflation and survey-based measures of inflation expectations show
that in FY18 overall inflation is expected to remain well below the target of 6.0 percent. On the fiscal
front, healthy growth in tax revenue collection by FBR during Q1-FY18, 22.0 percent compared to the
modest 4.5 percent during Q1-FY17, is a welcome development. Neat-term balance-of-payments
challenges continue to persist. However, visible improvements in export growth, notable increase in
foreign direct investments and expected other financial inflows will help contain these pressures.

A review of latest developments in the real sector show that during Q1-FY18 LSM growth has surpassed
its eatlier expectations as it has been recorded at 8.4 percent compared to 1.8 percent in the
corresponding period of FY17. This is explained by improved security conditions and power supply,
transformation of fixed investment into enhancements of productive capacity on the ground, low
inflation and stable interest rates. Further support comes from the continuation of CPEC projects.
Barring any extreme seasonal events, agriculture sector is expected to perform better for the second
consecutive year. This is explained by increase in both cultivated area and fertilizer off-take during the
Kharif season, on-going trend of investment in mechanization, higher uptick in agricultural credit and
unchanged support price for wheat at the time of its sowing. Accordingly, demand for services is also
expected to rise in FY18 given its inter-connectivity with the other two sectors. Taking all the evidence
together, real GDP growth is expected to meet its target level of FY18.

Turning to inflation, CPI inflation averaged 3.5 percent during Jul-Oct FY18 - well below the annual
inflation target. Higher international oil prices along with pass-through to domestic petroleum prices and
the imposition of regulatory duty on non-essential import items ate expected to increase inflation in the
coming months. However, while taking into account these effects, inflation is still expected to fall inside
the range of 4.5-5.5 percent projected at the start of FY18. Indeed, supply side dynamics, both for food
and non-food items, are improving given the gains in agricultural yields and investment in
manufacturing. The current growth momentum is being translated into upward pressure in the services
component of the CPI basket. Consequently, NFNE measure of core inflation remains relatively high
although stable around its current level of 5.3 percent (YoY) since November FY17.

An important development in the monetary sector is a visible change in the pattern of government
borrowing for budgetary financing. Instead of relying heavily on Central Bank financing like last year,
Government is securing funds both from SBP and scheduled banks. Alongside active liquidity
management by the Central Bank kept the overnight repo rate close to the policy rate and is supporting
the availability of credit. Indeed, the stock of credit to the private sector grew on YoY basis by Rs. 814.9
billion in October FY18 (a growth of 18.5 percent) as compated to Rs. 436.4 billion (11.0 percent
growth) in the corresponding period last year. Looking into the break-up of this credit expansion, the
already buoyant growth in fixed investment gained further traction at a slightly higher level relative to
FY17, while both working capital loans and consumer financing showed encouraging trends. These
developments are further supported by the improvement in capacity utilization of major sectors which
indicates growing demand.

Bank Alfalah functioning normally: SBP

A State Bank spokesman today reiterated that all banks, including Bank Alfalah
operating in the country under the effective regulatory and supervisory
oversight of SBP, are functioning normally which should not give any cause of
concern to any quarter. The general public should not pay any heed to the
rumours being spread by unscrupulous elements against a well established
healthy banking institution of the country.

Based on the performance of Bank Alfalah, the State Bank has no hesitation in
stating that the Bank is vibrant and resilient as its key performance indicators
are positive.

The spokesman further said that Bank Alfalah is owned by Abu Dhabi Group
which is a sound Group with unimpeachable credit worthiness.

SBP releases Annual Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for the fiscal
year 2019-20 today.

According to the report, following difficult but necessary stabilization efforts during the first nine
months of the fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy was well on course for a steady recovery on the eve of
the Covid-19 pandemic. By February 2020, the unprecedented balance of payments crisis created by
the unsustainable macroeconomic policies of previous years had been forcefully addressed through
sizable reductions in the twin fiscal and current account deficits. Following a round of monetary
tightening during FY19, core inflation remained relatively stable, notwithstanding an uptick in headline
inflation due to one-off and seasonal factors. In turn, this hard-won stabilization was beginning to lead
to the revival of economic activity and the restoration of business and consumer confidence.

However, this momentum was temporarily disrupted around the last quarter of the fiscal year by the
global and domestic spread of Covid-19 and the lockdown measures that it necessitated. While these
measures were remarkably successful in containing the outbreak in Pakistan, they simultaneously
strained manufacturing, retail, transport and trade-related activities. As a result, Pakistan’s real GDP is
estimated to have contracted by 0.4 percent in FY20 — the country’s first brush with negative economic
growth since FY52.

The report highlights that it was only due to the earlier gains on the macroeconomic stability front that
policymakers in Pakistan were able to extend aggressive support to businesses and households in
response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Without this support, the private sector would have found it even
more challenging to cope with the fallout from the mobility restrictions and supply-chain disruptions
created by the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression. In an unprecedented move,
the government was able to expand the volume and outreach of its social uplift programs, enabling
over 14.8 million households to receive emergency cash transfers for meeting essential needs to date.
For the first-time ever, the SBP arranged multiple emergency meetings of the Monetary Policy
Committee to react to the fast-evolving situation, and cut the policy rate by 625 bps over a roughly 3-
month time period, the second-largest cut among emerging markets in the wake of Covid-19. In
addition, the SBP also rolled out targeted and time-bound liquidity support for firms and households,
including the deferment of principal repayments; loan restructuring; refinancing for firms to pay
salaries to their employees in exchange for job protection; relaxations in performance criteria for
export-related refinance schemes; and concessionary refinance facilities for long-term investment
projects and for hospitals on the front-lines of the battle against the pandemic. Together, these
measures — mainly aimed at preventing liquidity problems from turning into solvency problems —
represented the largest liquidity backstops ever deployed by the SBP, and their estimated impact on
the cash flow of households and businesses was equivalent to 4.1 percent of GDP as of end-October
2020.

Importantly, policymakers were able to provide this strong and timely macroeconomic stimulus
without undermining external stability or the confidence of domestic and international investors. In
particular, despite heightened global risk aversion and unprecedented capital outflows from emerging
markets, movements in Pakistan’s asset prices, including the exchange rate and the stock market, and
sovereign risk perception remained in line with those across comparable economies. This reflected the
fact that the stimulus was provided without compromising the improvements in underlying

President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi lauds SBP and banks for progress in financial inclusion of
persons with disabilities

 

His Excellency President Islamic Republic of Pakistan Dr. Arif Alvi had an online meeting with Governor
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir, SAPM on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety, Dr Sania
Nishtar, senior SBP officials and Presidents/CEOs of banks today. The meeting took stock of the
progress on decisions made for improving the accessibility infrastructure for persons with disabilities.

In response to President, Dr. Alvi’s call, Governor SBP, Dr. Bagir, assured that SBP would continue
providing its full regulatory support to increase financial inclusion of persons with disabilities. The
banks’ Presidents/CEOs also pledged their complete cooperation for this objective.

In his welcome remarks, the Governor SBP appreciated the exceptional interest and resolve of the
President of Pakistan as a source of inspiration for all the stakeholders. He said that if the society does
not provide appropriate support to persons with disabilities, it leads to their economic
disempowerment depriving them of their independent economic and social lives. He remarked that
persons with disabilities could economically support themselves and contribute towards the society
when provided with adequate education, rehabilitation and financial and moral support. He
emphasized that a sizeable number of persons with disabilities do have the required capacity to work
and contribute in the mainstream economic activities and thus successfully support their families. He
urged the banks to be cognizant of this gap and explore avenues to make inclusion of this untapped
segment of the economy a reality.

SBP presented an update on different action items decided in the last meeting of SBP with the
President. The action items included accessible infrastructure at entrance of all bank branches and
ATM cabins, availability of forms and documents in braille for basic banking services, accessibility audit
of bank branches by SBP and allocation of credit targets for SBP refinance schemes on SME and Low
Cost Housing Finance.

The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, while speaking on the occasion said that the unavailability of
concrete information on the number of people with disabilities is a major limitation for designing
comprehensive plans to improve their quality of life. He shared that Government is working with
different stakeholders to have a better estimate of the number of people with disabilities that will help
their identification and certification.

The President of Pakistan appreciated SBP’s efforts and performance of banks in improving the
accessibility infrastructure at banks for persons with disabilities and lauded their efforts for increasing
financial inclusion of persons with disabilities. In particular, the President appreciated the
establishment of a Working Group by SBP for taking up the agenda. He, however, desired that timelines
along with a clear vision must be clearly defined for the Working Group. He further emphasized that
such working groups may also be created at each bank. He stated that creating awareness regarding
various facilities for persons with disabilities is highly imperative and social media can play an important
role in this regard.

The President further said that plight of persons with disabilities has become even more critical in the
middle of the prevalent COVID 19 crisis that is deepening pre-existing inequalities. He appreciated SBP’s
specific role in taking a number of measures to address the likely negative economic impacts on
individuals, businesses and banking institutions. The State Bank’s successful measures have reduced

Scam email on behalf of Governor Sate Bank of Pakistan

 

This is to inform general public that a scam email from a fake email address created in the
name of Governor State Bank of Pakistan is in circulation suggesting that the recipient has
received a large sum of money from a foreign government. The contents of said email,
forwarded by some recipients to SBP appear in the image below.

To the benefit of public, SBP clarifies that such email has never been issued by any person

general public and defaming and maligning the institution. Taking legal recourse against such
unscrupulous element behind these attempts, SBP has already lodged a complaint with the FIA
authorities in Karachi.

State Bank facilitates exporters by restoring advance payment facility

 

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed the Authorized Dealers to effect advance
payments up to USD 10,000/- per invoice on behalf of importers cum exporters for
import of raw materials, accessories and spares.

Earlier, SBP had restricted the advance payment facility in July 2018 which was
previously allowed to importers through Authorized Dealers. However on the
intervention of the chamber of commerce and industry, trade associations and the
ministry of commerce it has been decided to relax this ban to the extent of exporter
who have to import accessories, raw material and spare-parts for their exports. It is
expected that this will improve the export environment.

Banking Sector remains resilient during H1CY19,
says the Mid-Year Performance Review of the Banking Sector

State Bank of Pakistan has issued the Mid-Year Performance Review (MPR) of the Banking
Sector for the calendar year 2019 (CY19). The review comprehensively covers the performance
and soundness of the banking sector.

According to the review, the performance of the banking sector remained satisfactory, despite
challenging macroeconomic environment. Banking sector maintained its growth trajectory
with asset expansion of 5.3 percent during H1CY19 (Year-on-Year (YoY): 7.9 percent), primarily
funded by deposits that witnessed the highest growth since H1CY16. There was some
deceleration in growth in advances—a consequence of economic slowdown. Investments grew
marginally and banks exhibited renewed interest in long-term government securities i.e.
Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).

The overall risk profile of the banking sector remained robust. Though the asset quality
moderated, the earnings of the banking sector improved owing to increase in Net Interest
Income (NII). Resultantly, all profitability indicators showed improvement. The Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at 16.1 percent was well above the local and international minimum
benchmarks of 11.9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.

The review also includes the results of the 4*° wave of SBP’s Systemic Risk Survey, which
represents the views of the market participants.

The report is accessible at URL: http://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/HPR/H1CY19.pdf

SBP Reiterates not to share personal details on fake calls

It has come to the knowledge of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) that unscrupulous elements are making
phone calls to individuals, impersonating as officials of SBP or other agencies, seeking personal
information regarding their deposit accounts on the pretext that SBP is collecting information from
banking customers in light of emergency declared in the country due to COVID-19. In some instances,
the fraudsters also claim that the information is required to ensure smooth functioning of their
accounts in case ATM services become unavailable.

State Bank of Pakistan never seeks details of account holders of any bank and all such calls made on its
behalf are a hoax and with fraudulent intentions. Public is advised not to respond to any such calls and

provide any information.

Please report such calls to your bank immediately. In addition, these call can also be reported to SBP
helpline at 021-111-727-273 (during business hours) or at email cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk.

Tremendous potential exists for
branchless banking: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that tremendous
business potential exists for branchless banking in the country which allows financial
institutions and other commercial players to offer alternate and economical financial
services outside the bank premises.

Speaking at the inauguration of branchless banking product ‘Easy Paisa’ - a joint
effort of Tameer Microfinance Bank and Telenor Pakistan - at a local hotel in Karachi this
afternoon, Mr. Raza said that the State Bank has always encouraged innovation and
provided enabling regulatory environment in order to drive the banks to increase their
outreach. “As a regulator, we are concerned about the un-banked masses of our country
that do not have banking facilities,” he said and added that branchless banking is a
milestone to substantially increase the financial services outreach to the un-banked
communities.

He said the banks have started to show interest in branchless banking and SBP
has given regulatory approval to three banks to carryout branchless banking business.
Six banks have been given approvals to offer cell-phone base banking services to their
existing customer base as an alternate delivery medium, he said and added that there
are many other banks in initial discussions with SBP on their proposals to start
branchless banking.

SBP Governor said that developing an inclusive financial sector is a top policy
priority area for the State Bank. He said that in the recent past, complete transformation
of the banking industry, supported by privatization and restructuring and market-
oriented policies, has resulted in broadening, deepening and diversifying financial
services. “Yet, financial penetration remains quite low — with only 26 million depositors,
7 million borrowers, and over 20,000 people per bank branch in Pakistan,” he said and
added that a significant majority are unable to access even the simplest financial
services, meaning that they pay more to manage their money, find it harder to plan for
the future and cope with financial pressures, and are more vulnerable to financial
distress and over-indebtedness.

He said in this context, leveraging technology and finding innovative products
and delivery channels, such as mobile phone banking, is the best way to increase

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
January 28, 2020

1. At its meeting on 28% January 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy
rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC’s view that the outlook for inflation has
remained broadly unchanged. On the one hand, recent inflation outturns have been on the high side and
there remain near term risks to inflation primarily from food price shocks and potential increases in utility
prices. On the other hand, several factors are expected to gradually moderate the pressure on inflation. These
include the recent appreciation of the exchange rate after the introduction of the market-based exchange rate
and ongoing fiscal consolidation. On balance, the SBP’s projection for average inflation remained broadly
unchanged at 11 — 12 percent for FY20. The MPC also viewed the current monetary policy stance as
appropriate to bring inflation down to the medium-term target range of 5 — 7 percent over the next six to
eight quarters.

2. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors
along with their projections, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

3. ‘The MPC noted three key developments since the last meeting on 22""4 November 2019. First, the
ongoing and substantial reduction in the current account deficit and the orderly conditions in the foreign
exchange market after the transition to a market-based exchange rate system continued to strengthen the
country’s external accounts. Second, the IBA-SBP survey of business confidence showed an improvement in
the business community’s outlook for economic activity for a third successive wave. Third, fiscal
developments remained on track and in line with commitments made under the IMF-supported program,
buoying the overall economic reform sentiment.

Real sector

4. The latest production estimates of major crops indicate that all Kharif crops, except cotton, grew in line
with expectations. Cotton production has been revised downward due to adverse supply side shocks. Large
scale manufacturing (LSM) indicates that economic activity is strengthening in export-oriented and import-
competing industries, while inward-oriented industries continue to slow down. Specifically, LSM showed
gains in textiles, leather products, engineering goods, rubber products, cement and fertilizer, and declines in
auto, electronics, food, chemicals, and petroleum products. Primarily on account of adverse supply side
shocks to cotton production as well as the contraction in LSM to date, SBP’s projection for real GDP growth
for FY20 is likely to be revised downward. Nevertheless, available monthly indicators of activity show that
the slowdown in most economic sectors appears to have bottomed-out, and a gradual recovery is expected in
the coming months.

External sector

5. The current account deficit contracted by 75 percent to US$ 2.15 billion during the first half of FY20 due
to a notable reduction in imports and modest growth in both exports and workers’ remittances. Importantly,
export volumes of major items including rice, value-added textiles, leather products, and fish and meat,
exhibited a notable increase during Jul-Dec FY20. This reflects the benefits of a more competitive exchange
rate and take-up of incentive credit schemes for export-oriented sectors. The capital account also continued
to strengthen, with continued inflows of foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment.

utmost importance. Governor felt satisfaction that State Bank of Pakistan has achieved several
milestones right after its inception which will have long lasting impact on country’s economy.

was being felt for quite some time. He said he was happy to inaugurate revamped website of State
Bank along with its Urdu version to further spread its information and data to people of Pakistan.

SECP-SBP establish the Council of Regulators to strengthen Financial Stabilit

 

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP)
today (Friday) signed a letter of Understanding (LOU) to establish a Council of Regulators to mitigate
systemic risk. Mr. Riaz Riazuddin, Acting Governor, SBP, and Mr. Zafar Hijazi, the SECP Chairman,
signed the letter in a ceremony held at the SECP’s head office in Islamabad.

The Council will provide a forum for deliberating issues related to systemic risk, particularly those
having cross market and stability implications. It will suggest possible arrangements for crisis
preparedness and come up with a coordinated response. The Council will comprise of top officials of
the two regulators; SBP will be represented by the Governor, a Deputy Governor, and an Executive
Director. SECP will be represented by the Chairman, a Commissioner, and an Executive Director.

The formation of the Council is aligned with international practices. Since the global financial crisis,
maintaining financial stability has emerged as a key objective for central banks, financial regulatory
authorities and respective governments. To keep pace with global developments and enhance focus
on promoting and ensuring financial stability, both SBP and SECP have joined hands for strengthening
financial system stability and managing systemic risk.

The SBP has identified strengthening of the financial stability regime as one of the key goals under the
“SBP Vision 2020”. Similarly, management of systemic risk has been set as a regulatory responsibility
of the SECP under the SECP Act 1997. The establishment of the Council will not only facilitate SBP and
SECP in achieving their statutory and strategic objectives but also further enhance their collaboration
for promoting the stability of the financial system in the country.

The Council is a significant step forward to bring Pakistan in line with developed countries in risk
management and to protect the integrity of our financial system.

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

Exchange rate has broad based implications for resource allocation, trade
openness, balance of payments and growth of the economy and therefore it needs to be
left to market fundamentals so that it aligns itself closer to the long run equilibrium rate.
Given the significance and sensitivities surrounding exchange rate policy regime, it is
critical for the central bank to ensure that market players understand well the exchange

dynamics in Pakistan and the central bank policy stance in this area.

I have convened this press conference following reports of misperceptions and
misunderstandings regarding central bank’s positioning on the exchange rate. Although
I have clarified on several occasions that the central bank is not in the business of
devaluing or artificially backing the currency but there continue to be speculations or
improper interpretation and pressures on the Government to manipulate and maneuver

the exchange rate.

To set the record right, the central bank abandoned fixed exchange rate regime a
long time ago and moved to a floating exchange rate regime since early 2000. While the
initial years of reforms did see sharp depreciation of the rupee, with the emergence of
macroeconomic stability, Pakistan has enjoyed a degree of exchange rate stability, which

has augured well for restoring investor confidence.

The Debate on exchange rate adjustments has lately been re-triggered by a set of
events which have included recent weaknesses in the export performance and the recent
IMF Article IV Report. There are some clarifications that are in order to set the debate
right in this context right. The IMF has not advocated, in its consultations with Pakistan,
any depreciation and rather has provided its perspective and analysis of the movements
in the real effective exchange rate. The exchange rate assessment offered by analysts is
often highly eclectic and subjective in nature as different approaches and methodologies
offer different inferences. Abstracting from theoretical debates, the reality is that

Pakistan exchange rate regime is determined in the interbank market and trends are

SBP takes measures to ensure continuous availability of banking services amid COVID-19

situation
SBP held a meeting with bankstoday,through video link, to assess their readiness to ensure
uninterrupted supply of banking services to clients in the wake of lockdowns and closure of
cities by Federal and Provincial Governments due to COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting was
chaired by the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir and was attended by bank’s presidents and
senior SBP officials. The following decisions were made by SBP after consultations with the
banks.

1. Inthesedifficult times the banking industry willprovide socially responsible banking
servicesand facilitate their clients in every possible way. Banks will inform the public
using all available means of communications including advertisements in print and
social media for promotion of digital banking and cash less payments and funds
transfers.

2. Continuous availability of ATMswill be ensuredby keeping them up and running 24/7
by the banks. Banks’ call centers and helplines must also be operative 24/7 and timely
resolution of the complaints shall be ensured.

3. Recognizing the need for issuance of fit, authenticated and disinfected cash by the
banks. Detailed instructions have beenprovided by SBP to ensure to clean, disinfect,
seal and quarantine all cash being collected from hospitals and clinics and to block
circulation of such cash in the market. The banks shall report daily collection of cash
from hospitals to SBP, which shall credit bank’s accounts for the amounts so
quarantined by them.Further, arrangements are being made to provide sufficient
fresh or disinfected cash to banks enabling them to issue fresh cash or the re-issuable
cash thatremained in quarantine for at least fifteen (15) days to their clients. Banks
have been ensured that SBP has sufficient quantity of such cash, and it would meet all
demands for such cash.

4. All critical functions and systems required to provide banking services, including Real
Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) will remain available as usual even during the
lock downs. Large scale closure of branches may cause rush and congestion in the
operative branches, which may be counterproductive to efforts to contain the spread
of the disease. The banks may, however, close branches wherestaff is infected and for
which requisite human resourceis not available.The situation will be reviewed again in
couple of days based on the customers’ visit to branches during lock downs.

5. SBP,from 24'*March 2020,has invoked ascenario wherein minimal staff will be
present at its premises to undertake critical functions,whereas the rest of the staff
has been allowed to work from home. The Banks can also make such arrangements
both in their branches and Head/Regional offices. Further, the banks may start their
branch operations from 10 a.m. if needed to better facilitate their clients.

6. SBP and the banks will constantly monitor the evolving situation and shall not
hesitate to take whatever steps that may be required in the public interest.

Overseas Pakistanis remit US $3.5 billion in the first_two months of FY18

Overseas Pakistani workers remitted US $3496.13 million in the first two months (July to
August) of FY18, compared with US $3089.02 million received during the same period in the
preceding year.

During August 2017, the inflow of worker’s remittances amounted to US $ 1954.46 million,
which is 26.78% higher than July 2017 and 11% higher than August 2016. The country wise
details for the month of August 2017 show that inflows from Saudi Arabia, UAE, USA, UK,
GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman) and EU countries amounted to
US $511.28 million, US $440.38 million, US $260.34 million, US $249.14 million, US $230.22
million and US $62.75 million respectively compared with the inflow of US $507.26 million,

Monetary Policy Statement
July 22, 2017

At the start of FY18, three features of Pakistan’s economy stand out. First, average headline inflation though
higher than FY17 is expected to be lower than earlier outlook and will stay below the target of 6.0 percent,
mainly on the back of favorable supply conditions. Second, domestic demand is set to gain further traction as
evidenced in the current growth in the real sector, credit to private sector and imports. Third, on the external
front, the underperformance of both exports and workers’ remittances greatly impinged upon the current
account deficit which reached USD 12.1 billion in FY17. For the time being, the overall balance of payments
is expected to stay at a manageable level in FY18- an assessment relying on steady anticipated financial
account inflows and improvement in world growth. The first two features show that the economy is on an
expansionary phase, while the third feature highlights near-term balance of payments challenges.

Reflecting further on CPI tendencies, the headline inflation (in YoY terms) has softened at 3.9 percent in
June 2017, while core inflation has stayed at 5.5 percent since April 2017. The latter does indicate rising
demand. However, marginally lower six-months ahead inflation expectations- captured by IBA- SBP's
Consumer Confidence Survey of July-2017, show that these remain reasonably anchored. Accordingly, SBP is
projecting average CPI inflation in the range of 4.5 — 5.5 percent for FY18. This projection is explained by
lower than anticipated increase in international oil prices, recent behavior of CPI inflation in June 2017, stable
administered prices and lower inflationary expectations.

Turning to the real sector, cumulative LSM (YoY) growth statistics till May 2017 depict a strong positive
momentum with food (especially sugar), steel, cement, automobiles, electronics and pharmaceuticals in the
lead. Indeed, July-May LSM growth is 5.7 percent against 3.4 percent recorded during the same period last
year. Furthermore, the outcome of agriculture sector is far superior to FY16 reaching its target of 3.5 percent
in FY17. This performance is explained by better supplies of factors of production- positively affecting yields
of all major crops, and an increase in area under cultivation of sugarcane. The services sector posted 6.0
percent increase in FY17 compared to 5.5 percent increase in FY16. Going forward, these developments will
further entrench in FY18.

As far as the money markets are concerned, market liquidity was able to accommodate strong credit demand
from the private sector. In fact, increased economic activity, considerable increase in bank deposits, and low
interest rates translated into private sector credit flows in FY17 reaching a decade high of Rs748 billion as
compated with Rs446 billion in FY16. It is encouraging that fixed investments and working capital loans grew
by Rs 258.5 billion and Rs 360.5 billion in FY17 compared with an expansion of Rs 171.7 billion and Rs
219.3 billion last year, respectively. Demand for consumer financing, especially for auto and personal loans,
also gathered pace during FY17. These trends are set to continue in FY18 given the developments on the

real side.

On the external front, the current account deficit reached US$ 12.1 billion during FY17. While exports and
workers’ remittances declined, imports growth surged by 17.7 percent in FY17. This is mainly owing to
machinery imports both for CPEC and non-CPEC energy and infrastructure projects, whereas, imports for
plant up-gradation under the ongoing export package for the textiles sector also added pressures. However,
in view of the last four months performance, the decline in exports appears to have bottomed out.

purpose. Out of various proposals, the proposal of making of Conference Rooms/Committee
Rooms was finalized.

Members of Sindh Heritage committee Mr. Arif Hassan, Mr. Hameed Haroon and Dr.
Kaleemullah Lashari were also present on the occasion. Mr.Hameed Haroon appreciated the
services of the Governor State Bank in safeguarding the national heritage of the country as
this is the second heritage building which has been conserved by the State Bank and
readopted for use. He also commented that only a few Government institutions are making
conscious efforts for such purpose. The members of the Committee also lauded the efforts of
State Bank and the Governor in this regard.

Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Jameel Ahmad, has emphasized the need for a review of
the prevailing banking business models to effectively address the challenges of rapidly changing financial
and technological landscape.

Mr. Ahmad was addressing eminent scholars, industry practitioners and leading professionals on the
topic of “Changing Dynamics: Bank of the Future” as a key note speaker at the 29"" Annual Convention of
Association of Professional Bankers (APB)—Sri Lanka, held at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo on 21*
November, 2017.

Deputy Governor, SBP in his speech reflected on the prevailing course of banking and said that the shifts
in the supervisory approach of regulators and the regulatory measures that were taken after the Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-8 as well as rapid technological developments are mainly reshaping the future of
banking. “Although the reforms that were undertaken after the Global Financial Crisis were focused on
achieving financial stability have improved the overall resilience of the financial system, , they have
increased the complexity of the regulatory framework from multiple perspectives”, he highlighted
adding, “This has resulted in contraction of cross border lending, partial scaling back of off shore
operations of multinational banks and a decline in the post crisis profitability of banks”.

Mr. Ahmad highlighted that in the wake of the rise of internet and social media and availability of low
cost mobile and other smart devices, bank customers are demanding enhanced and more customized
services. If banks fail to address them, they may face extensive competition from non-banks and fintechs
who are rapidly making inroads in the domain of financial intermediation.

The Deputy Governor also spoke briefly on the role and plans of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to
transform the domestic banking sector. He shared that in order to mitigate growing risks to the banking
sector SBP took certain measures like continuous improvements in regulatory framework, building of
Financial Stability Architecture and addressing concerns about Systemic Risks using macro-prudential
actions like Developing frameworks for Large Exposures, Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs)
and Consolidated Supervision.

Mr. Ahmad briefed the gathering about SBPs role as a facilitator and catalyst of innovation especially in
the domain of payments digitization. “SBP has issued various guidelines and instructions for the
development and strengthening of Payment Systems infrastructure in the country”, he said. He also
shared SBPs proactive approach in using the National Identity System, NADRA for allowing digital on-
boarding of customers, especially the unbanked population, and mitigating the risks relating to Money
Laundering and Terrorist Financing.

Annual review of payment systems shows significant growth in key
performance indicators

During FY16, Payment Systems in Pakistan have shown significant growth in key
performance indicators. It is encouraging to witness consistent upward trend in volume and
value of payments through digital/electronic channels which compliment the SBP vision to

promote digital payments in the country.

The volume and value of Large Value Transactions through RTGS reached 930,501 and Rs.
231.7 trillion respectively during FY16 showing an increase of 21% and 29% in volume and
value respectively from the FY15. Though the volume of paper based transactions have
decreased by 6 % during the year, they still constitute approximately 38% of volume of total
retail payments. On the other hand, the use of e-Banking channels has shown bullish trend as
evident from increase of e-Banking transactions by 16% in volume and 4% in value. Likewise,
Real-time Online Banking transactions also rose 135.4 million by volume and Rs. 32.3 trillion
by value showing an increase of 19% in volume and 2% in value of e-banking transactions

during the period under review.

The use of Alternate Delivery Channels (ADCs) such as ATMs, POS terminals, Internet and
Mobile Banking also showed rising trend as of June 16 as 39.2 million transactions valuing
approximately Rs.200 billion were carried out at POS terminals as compared to 32.1 million
transactions valuing Rs.172 billion which showed a surge of 22% in volume and 16% in value
as compared to the previous year. Likewise, Internet and Mobile banking also showed steady
growth. The Internet Banking rose to 18% in volume & 10% in value whereas Mobile

Banking showed an increase of 8% in volume and 5% in value during the period under review.

Payment System infrastructure also showed phenomenal growth during the period under
review. The number of branches increased from 11,937 to 13,179 whereas total number of
ATMs installed in the country increased from 9,597 to 11,381 during the year. On the other
hand, 9,586 POS terminals were added to the network totaling 50,769 POS terminals as on
June 30, 2016.

Going forward, SBP is working on a two pronged strategy for effectively enabling the

adoption of electronic/digital payments by the general public in Pakistan. Firstly, the

896,2006-07-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Monetary Policy Statement for Jul-Dec 2006

This statement is based on information received up to July 27, 2006

 

Highlights

State Bank and the Government of Pakistan have managed to achieve a fair
degree of success in containing inflationary pressures with average increase
in consumer price index close to annual F'Y06 target of 8 percent.

Money supply growth for FY06, while higher than target, remained well
contained and much below average broad money (M2) growth of the last few
years.

Real GDP growth target of 7 percent for FY07 set by government seems
achievable as strong aggregate demand lends confidence that investment and
capacity expansion will gain further momentum in the economy.

Balance of risk has tilted towards managing domestic and external imbalances
effectively and curbing inflationary pressures.

Though inflation decelerated, the need to reduce volatility and achieve further
reduction in inflation rate to 6.5 percent (FYO7 target) underscores need for
continued effective economic management.

Meeting investment requirements of growing productive sector is assigned
high priority by SBP that recently offered special financing incentives for
textiles and exports, and has underscored need for diverse sector
requirements, while keeping risk exposure tightly within limits.

Most critical will be the need to diversify the source of domestic borrowings to
keep central bank financing within manageable limits by, among others,
issuing long-term debt which would set a benchmark for catalyzing corporate
debt.

Banks have been incentivized through recent change in cash reserve
requirement/statutory liquidity requirement (CRR/SLR) to improve returns to
depositors, and tighten their internal control systems, while managing their
exposures effectively.

SBP is further tightening its monetary policy by raising its policy rate (SBP 3-
day Repo Rate) from 9 percent by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent.

These measures coupled with effective consultations between the State Bank
and Ministry of Finance on the level and mix of domestic borrowings lends
confidence that money supply growth will be contained and aligned to the
nominal GDP growth in FY07.

SBP Issues Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk Management Framework for Financial
Institutions

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk
Management Framework for Financial Institutions (Fls). The Framework has been developed
after extensive consultation with both internal & external stakeholders. Earlier on March 14,
2017, the draft of the framework was published for public consultation.

The framework is based on principles of international standards and best practices for
technology governance and risk management including cyber security. It aims to provide
enabling regulatory environment for managing risks associated with the use of technology.
The instructions aims to enhance the proactive environment in Fls to various aspects of the
information technology, security, operations, audit and related domains and to create overall
safe and secure technology operations in Fls that will benefit and enhance the confidence of
all the stakeholders.

The framework will apply to all Fis which includes commercial banks (public and private
sector banks), Islamic banks, Development Finance Institutions (DFls), and Microfinance
Banks (MFBs). The framework is not ""one-size-fits-all"" and implementation of the same shall
be risk-based and commensurate with size, nature and types of products and services and
complexity of IT operations of the individual Fls.

While implementing this framework, Fils are expected to exercise sound judgment to
determine the applicable provisions relevant to their technology risk profile. Senior
management of the FI(s) will monitor the implementation of this framework on an ongoing
basis and the Board of Directors will review the implementation process on quarterly basis.
SBP has further advised the Fls to follow a phased approach towards implementation of the
framework starting with a gap analysis between their current status and this framework,

SBP releases First Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its First Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for
FY20. According to the report, Pakistan’s economy moved progressively along the adjustment path during the
first quarter of FY20. The macroeconomic stabilization process picked up momentum with the initiation of the
IMF’s Extended Fund Facility program: the SBP continued to keep the monetary policy consistent with the
medium-term inflation target; whereas, consolidation efforts were visible on the fiscal front. Furthermore, a
market-based exchange rate system was implemented, to which the interbank foreign exchange market
adjusted relatively well. Notably, the government avoided deficit monetization, including rollover of SBP debt
and actively pursued documentation efforts.

According to the report, the payoff from ongoing stabilization efforts has become visible in the form of
declining twin deficits. The current account deficit in Q1-FY20 fell to less than half of last year’s level,
primarily on the back of significant import compression. Owing to low unit prices, exports growth remained
low. However, in volumetric terms exports witnessed noticeable growth. On the fiscal front, the overall deficit
remained lower as compared to the same period last year, and the primary balance recorded a surplus for the
first time in 7 quarters. This improvement was made possible through both revenue enhancing and
expenditure control measures. Importantly, development expenditures witnessed a sharp growth of 30.5
percent during the quarter.

In case of GDP, the report noted that the revised estimates for the kharif season suggest that the production
of important crops is likely to fall short of target for FY20. The large-scale manufacturing sector witnessed a
decline of 5.9 percent in Q1-FY20 on YoY basis. This contraction was broad-based, as construction-allied
industries, petroleum and automobile industries continued on downward path. In contrast, previous
corrections in the exchange rate helped the export-oriented industries, as reflected in the relatively better
performance of textiles and leather. On balance, however, achieving the real GDP growth target of 4 percent
appears unlikely.

The report further highlighted that the average headline CPI inflation reached 11.5 percent in Q1-FY20,
extending the steep upward trend persistent since the beginning of FY19. Not only this level was double the
inflation observed in the same quarter last year, it was also the highest level of quarterly inflation since Q4-
FY12. This outcome was attributed to the lagged pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation towards the
end of FY19; rationalization of energy tariffs; and revenue-led fiscal measures taken in the budget 2019-20,
which included the imposition of federal excise duty on a number of consumer items, and the ending of the
zero-rating regime for export-oriented sectors and of the reduced GST regime on sugar.

On the external front, the balance of payments continued to improve during Q1-FY20. Beside significant
improvement in trade deficit, and with the receipt of the first EFF tranche from the IMF and increase in foreign
portfolio investment, the current account gap was plugged by the available financial flows. These inflows also
helped the SBP to increase its foreign exchange reserves by USS 656.2 million and reduce its net forward
liabilities by USS 1.3 billion during the quarter.

Going forward, the report emphasizes, it is vital that the government continues to address the underlying
structural vulnerabilities and put the economy on a balanced and sustainable growth trajectory. Furthermore,
there is a need to build on gains on the ease of doing business front. Side by side, it is equally important for
firms to leverage on the facilitative policies, particularly the export-promotion incentives, and gain a foothold
in the global value chains (GVCs). As mentioned in a separate special section in the report, increased
participation in the GVCs would not only align the country’s product mix with trends in global demand, but

also put the exports on a sustainable growth path.

State Bank of Pakistan wins the global award
as the best Central Bank in Promoting Islamic Finance

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has won the global award as the best Central Bank in promoting
Islamic finance for the year 2018. The coveted award is conferred by Islamic Finance News
(IFN), an arm of REDmoney Group, Malaysia. IFN Best Banks Poll is regarded as one of the
most prestigious accolades in the Islamic finance industry.

The IFN Award as the best central bank for promotion of Islamic finance is the global
endorsement of SBP initiatives for promotion of Islamic banking in the country. The award
reflects an international recognition of the strategic measures which SBP is undertaking to
put in place a robust policy environment for Islamic banking to prosper.

The category of the Best Central Bank in Promoting Islamic Finance is always one of the most
closely fought contests with regulators battling for the supremacy through exceptional
advances made, during the year, in the field of regulation and standardization. SBP is
honored to have won this award for the third time in last four years. Previously, SBP was
bestowed with this coveted award earlier in 2015 and 2017.

Islamic banking industry in Pakistan has witnessed an impressive growth in 2018 with its
assets reaching 12.9% of banking sector and deposits accounting for 14.8% of the total
banking industry deposits. “The support of Pakistan’s central bank is driving progress in the
wider Islamic banking sector, and the country’s Shariah compliant institutions are posting
impressive results”, IFN quoted.

It may be noted that the last year continued to see growing interest from the players
wherein industry footprints kept on enlarging with two new institutions getting license to
offer Islamic banking products and services. SBP also introduced Shariah compliant version
of Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) enabling Islamic banking customers to avail subsidized
financing from Islamic banks for setting up export oriented projects. Certain measures were
also undertaken to augment the regulatory framework for Islamic banking industry besides
taking initiatives for enhancing capacity levels to facilitate development of human resource
for this ever growing market.

It is pertinent to mention that Islamic banking industry in Pakistan is also receiving continued
support of the Government of Pakistan.

National Bank of Pakistan today experienced unanticipated technical difficulties in their operating
system while catering to extraordinary demand for cash on the occasion of Eid ul Fitr and
countrywide monthly pension disbursements. Customers of the bank had to face difficulties in
availing banking services at several locations in the country. The State Bank of Pakistan has taken
immediate remedial measures with the concerned bank to ensure uninterrupted provision of banking
services to the general public, particularly the pensioners. The operations of National Bank have now

Further, National Bank of Pakistan has also been instructed to keep all their branches open to make
disbursements to the visiting pensioners/customers till late hours. Also, all banks including NBP have

been instructed to ensure that all their ATMs remain functional and disburse cash through Eid break

This year, SBP has made elaborate efforts to ensure availability of banking services to the
general public. These measures are aimed at providing hassle free financial services to the
general public during holy Ramazan, forthcoming Edi-ul-Fitr and the extended holidays. In this
regard, SBP has issued special instructions for the opening of all bank branches on Saturdays (2° and
9"" July). Banks were also advised to ensure the uninterrupted availability of ATM machines across the
country, and for this purpose State Bank has provided unprecedentedly abundant amount of cash for

SBP enhances loan limits and expands relief measures for microfinance

 

borrowers

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the limits for housing finance and microenterprise loans up to
Rs3 million from the existing limit of Rs1 million for borrowings from the microfinance banks. Likewise, the
maximum size of general loans has been enhanced from Rs150,000 to Rs350,000. Further, to
commensurate with enhanced loan sizes, annual income eligibility for general loans and housing loans has
been increased up to Rs1.2 million and Rs1.5 million, respectively. Moreover, the limit for lending against

gold collateral to meet borrowers’ immediate domestic or emergency needs has also been enhanced.

The decision to increase the limit of housing finance loans has been made in view of the fact that the existing
loan limit was insufficient to promote low cost housing finance through MFBs. Similarly, limits for lending
to micro enterprises needed to be enhanced considering the large unmet demand from Micro & Small
Enterprise (MSEs). These initiatives would further support the micro borrowers and enterprises and an early
revival of economic activities in the current challenging times. However, in order to ensure sustainability,
the enhanced loans sizes for housing and microenterprises would be allowed to those MFBs which are on

sound footing and have the capacity to successfully cater the higher loan sizes.

In addition, SBP Relief Package for microfinance banks, which included deferment of principal and
restructuring of microfinance loans to deal with the adverse implications of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,
have now been expanded with three measures. First, the relief measures that were earlier available from
Feb 15, 2020 have now been allowed to borrowers who were regular on December 31, 2019. This would
allow more borrowers to avail the regulatory relief who were previously not eligible. Second, to facilitate

State Bank of Pakistan announces three measures to address the economic and health
challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19

First, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the SBP cut its policy rate by 75 basis points.
As noted in the accompanying Monetary Policy Statement, the dominant development since
the last MPC meeting has been the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. This has
precipitated a slowdown in world demand and volatility in global financial markets, as well as
a steep fall in global oil prices. Together with the domestic deceleration in food prices and
significant decline in consumer price expectations, the outlook for inflation in Pakistan has
therefore improved, paving the way for today’s rate cut. The current market volatility being
experienced in Pakistan is externally driven and the strengthening in the fundamentals of
Pakistan’s economy that drove the improvement in Pakistan markets before the Coronavirus
outbreak remains intact. As a result, volatility is likely to subside as global risk aversion reduces.
The SBP stands ready to take whatever additional actions that may be necessary to safeguard
price and financial stability and support economic growth.

Second, the SBP announced a “Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF)” and its
Shariah compliant version to stimulate new investment in manufacturing. Under this
scheme, the SBP will refinance banks to provide financing at a maximum end-user rate of 7
percent for 10 years for setting up of new industrial units. The total size of the scheme is Rs
100 billion, with a maximum loan size per project of Rs 5 billion. It can be accessed by all
manufacturing industries, with the exception of the power sector, where an SBP refinance
facility for renewable energy projects already exists. In line with the SBP's other refinancing
schemes, the credit risk will be borne by banks and the selection of projects to finance will also
be determined by them. This scheme will help counter any possible delays in the setting up of
new projects that investors were planning prior to the Coronavirus outbreak. It will be available
for one year only, requiring a letter of credit (LC) to be opened by end-March 2021.

Third, the SBP announced a “Refinance Facility for Combating COVID-19 (RFCC)” and its
Shariah compliant version to support hospitals and medical centers in combating the spread
of COVID-19. Under this scheme, the SBP will refinance banks to provide financing at a
maximum end-user rate of 3 percent for 5 years for the purchase of equipment to detect,
contain and treat the Coronavirus. The SBP will provide this facility to banks at 0 percent. All
hospitals and medical centers registered with federal or provincial health agencies and which
are engaged in the control and eradication of COVID-19 will be eligible for this facility. The total
size of the scheme is Rs 5 billion, with a maximum financing limit per hospital or medical center
of Rs 200 million. This scheme will help contain the spread of the Coronavirus and reduce its
human toll. It is available until end-September 2020.

Workers’ Remittances Maintain Strong Momentum in December 2020

¢ Workers’ remittances maintained their strong momentum for the seventh consecutive month in
December. Remittances rose further to $2.4 billion, growing by 16.2 percent on a year-on-year basis
and 4.2 percent on a month-on-month basis.

© On a cumulative basis, workers’ remittances reached an unprecedented level of $14.2 billion during
the first half of FY21, 24.9 percent higher than the same period last year. This is the highest half yearly
growth since FY07.

¢ Remittance inflows have been well-diversified. Most of the inflows during H1-FY21 were sourced from
Saudi Arabia ($4.0 billion), United Arab Emirates ($3.0 billion), United Kingdom ($1.9 billion) and United
States ($1.2 billion).

¢ This strong growth in workers’ remittances is attributable to the increased use of formal channels on
the back of sustained efforts by the government and SBP to encourage inflows through official channels
as well as limited cross-border travel due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with
favorable foreign exchange market dynamics.

SBP reiterates currency note features to help visually impaired persons

It has come into the notice of SBP that visually impaired persons find it difficult to recognize and
distinguish amongst different Pakistani currency notes.

SBP, for the information of the general public and specifically visually impaired persons, reiterates that
Pakistani currency notes have specific features to help the visually impaired persons to identify the
genuineness of currency notes and to distinguish between different denominations.

All currency notes of Rs.20 and above contain braille features on its front side that help to determine
the denomination of a currency notes. For this purpose, raised dots and small horizontal lines are
printed on the left bottom corner just above the banknote serial number. This feature makes banknote
denominations easily distinguishable by rubbing the thumb against these raised features. The braille
features in each denomination appear in this manner: Rs.20 has one line, Rs.50 two lines and Rs.100
has three lines while other higher denomination notes have dots as braille feature. Specifically, Rs.500
has one dot; Rs.1000 two dots, and Rs.5000 three dots.

All braille features on currency notes of all denominations of Rs. 20 & above are printed through Intaglio
process, due to which they appear raised and on the front side of the note only. Thus, a visually
impaired person can easily infer the denomination of the banknotes by feeling the raised printing as
well as its genuineness.

All Pakistani currency notes have denomination-wise tiered sizing. Each currency note has the same
width of 65 mm whereas lengthwise, each banknote is exactly 08 mm longer than the preceding
denomination. Thus the highest denomination banknote of Rs.5000 is 48mm longer than the lowest
denomination currency note of Rs.10.

The incorporation of a number of strong security features including braille features in banknotes are
aimed at facilitating general public. To create awareness about currency note features among the
masses, SBP provided complete details on its website (available at
http://www.sbp.org.pk/finance/index.asp). Moreover, it has launched Videos and a Smartphone
application on security features of currency notes which provide information on security features of
currency notes both in descriptive and pictorial forms.

It may also be mentioned that 16 field offices of SBP-BSC spread across Pakistan, conduct awareness
campaigns all over the country. These sessions are usually arranged in high traffic areas and involve in
depth briefing on currency note features. To augment the awareness of banknote features, SBP has
mandated the prominent display through posters containing security features in every commercial
bank branch under instructions to guide customers of the currency note features, as required.

State Bank allows debt-swap amounting to Rs. 34 billion
to textile industry under LTF-EOP Scheme

The State Bank of Pakistan has allowed an amount of Rs. 34 billion as refinance to
commercial banks/DFIs as debt-swap option to textile industry under its ‘Long Term
Financing for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP)’ Scheme upto 31% December, 2006
against the original estimates of Rs. 30 billion.

Out of Rs. 34 billion of debt-swap, privatized banks (including NBP) have swapped long
term loans of Rs. 21.9 billion followed by private banks (Rs. 6.29 billion), foreign banks
(Rs. 4.1 billion) and development finance institutions (Rs. 1.67 billion). Tenor for the
converted loans on an average is expected to be close to 4 years. The exporters are expected
to make a mark up saving of approximately Rs. 35 million during the first quarter of the debt-
swap.

Besides debt-swap, the State Bank has also allowed Rs. 9.1 billion as new LTF-EOP
refinance. Out of Rs. 9.1 billion, the highest amount Rs. 3.7 billion was availed by privatised
banks followed by private banks (Rs. 3.3 billion), foreign banks (Rs. 1.2 billion) and DFIs
(Rs. 0.9 billion) respectively.

Thus, on an overall basis, the State Bank has allowed Rs. 43.1 billion as refinance under the
Scheme. Textile exporters have the flexibility to seek additional new loans under LTF-EOP
as banks by and large are currently within the refinance limits set by SBP for 2006-2007.

It may be pointed out that the State Bank, with the aim of relieving some of the difficulties
faced by the textile sector due to increasing competition from the neighbouring countries and
the rising manufacturing and business costs, offered a debt swap option under the LTF-EOP
Scheme. The option provided an opportunity to the textile sector (excluding spinning sector
but including its six sub sectors) to swap their long term loans taken from commercial banks
and DFIs during January 1, 2003 to 31 December, 2006 for import of machinery for their
units under LTF-EOP Scheme, which offers mark up rates fixed for the tenor of the loan,

approximately 5-6% below market rates.

SBP issues instructions for promotion of Islamic Banking

 

Keeping in view the significant potential of Islamic Banking Windows (IBWs) in enhancing the
share and outreach of Shariah compliant financial services and increase in financial inclusion, SBP
has issued today revised instructions for banks to expand the scope of operations of IBWs. IBWs
can now offer all types of financing products to their customers including Corporates, SMEs,
Agriculture, Housing, and Consumers. However, this facility is subject to the condition that
respective IBW branch shall be converted into full-fledged Islamic banking branch within a period

of three years. For details: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ibd/2020/C2.htm

At present, Islamic banking products and services are being offered by full-fledged Islamic banks,
Islamic banking subsidiaries and Islamic banking branches of conventional banks after getting
approval/license from SBP. Conventional banks can open IBWs, which are dedicated counters in
conventional branches, after getting permission from SBP; however, these were not allowed to
offer any financing products. With 1,400 IBWs of 11 banks currently operational in the country,
their potential to improve access to finance will increase significantly. Further, it will contribute
towards increase in financial inclusion through provision of Shariah compliant financing facilities
to vast majority of population.

The revised instructions also incorporate different amendments or additions to existing
regulations and include policy formulation on IBWs, submission of annual IBWs expansion plan,
physical setup & display requirements for IBWs, opening & closure of IBWs, their fee structure,
and revisions in reporting requirements. These revised instructions will supersede all previous
instructions issued on IBWs by SBP from time to time.

It is expected that this new policy measure will contribute towards achieving the targets set under
National Financial Inclusion Strategy for Islamic banking, which envisages attaining a share of 25%
percent in total assets and deposits of the banking industry and 30% share in total branch
network of the industry by the end of 2023.

Expansion of local CNY Clearing and Settlement Mechanism in Pakistan

SBP has allowed Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Pakistan Limited to establish their local CNY
clearing and settlement setup in Pakistan. SCB Pakistan can now open CNY accounts of the
banks operating in Pakistan to facilitate settlement of CNY based transactions such as
remittance to/from China. SCB can also provide CNY liquidity to the interbank market for the
settlement of CNY based transactions.

It may be mentioned here that over the years, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been at the
forefront in providing a conducive policy & regulatory environment to encourage the use of
local currencies in trade and financing transactions between China and Pakistan.

Earlier, SBP had also permitted Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC)
Pakistan in 2015 and Bank of China Limited (BOC) Pakistan in 2018 to establish similar local
CNY clearing and settlement mechanism in Pakistan.

The expansion of local CNY clearing and settlement setup in Pakistan is expected to further
improve efficiency of the local banking system in transacting in CNY, enhance market liquidity
and facilitate rising trade and investment with China through fostering competition and
increasing CNY resource avenues.

Revised Instructions regarding Making and Dispatch of

Shipping Documents by the Exporters

In wake of changing global trade practices and to facilitate exporters, the State Bank has
relaxed its foreign exchange regulations allowing exporters to directly dispatch transport
documents to the buyers abroad against shipments valuing upto US Dollar 100,000/- or
equivalent. The authorized dealers (banks) have been advised to above effect vide F.E.
Circular No. 11 issued today by the State Bank.

The development is expected to provide manifold benefits to the local exporters including
reducing the cost of doing business, efficient processing of export documents and improving
competitiveness of Pakistani exports in the international market.

Earlier, the carriers (shipping companies, airlines, railways, etc.) were required to draw the transport
documents (bills of lading, airway bill, railway receipts, etc.) only to the order of an authorized dealer
for exports taking place from Pakistan and the same were required to be dispatched to the buyer
abroad through an authorized dealer.

Banking Sector remains sound and stable, says the SBP Quarterly Performance
Review for Q3CY16

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for
the quarter ended 30"" September, 2016 (Q3CY16) today. In terms of the QPR, banking sector has
remained in sound and stable state during the reviewed quarter. The solvency profile of the banking
sector has strengthened as Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has improved to 16.8 percent, while profit
after tax has stood at PKR 138.9 billion for the first nine months of CY 2016.

The report highlights that the asset base of the banking sector has registered a decrease of 1.6 percent.
The reviewed quarter is marked with seasonal dedine in gross advances by 2.3 percent on account of
net retirement by private sector and commodity operation finandng. Textile, sugar, cement,
agribusiness, and chemical and pharmaceutical sectors have observed net retirement while production
and transmission of energy sector has revealed positive financing demand. Banks’ investments have
fallen by 2.5 percent during Q3CY16.

Deposits of the banking sector, after observing some deceleration in recent past, have inched up by 0.6
percent which is in contrast to fall of deposits usually seen in the third quarter of a calendar year. The
rise in deposits is due to lower decline in current deposits and higher growth in saving and fixed
deposits.

During the reviewed quarter, Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) have observed marginal dedine, though,
NPLs to gross advances ratio has slightly increased. The ratio has inched up by 20 bps to 11.3 percent as
of September 30, 2016 but entirely on account of dedine in seasonal financing activity. The coverage
ratio, provisions to NPLs, has, on the other hand, improved by 30 bps to reach 82.7 percent as of
September 30, 2016.

The dip in interest margins and rising costs has narrowed the Year-to-Date profitability of the banking
sector. As a result, return on assets has declined to 2.1 percent as compared to 2.2 percent in Q2CY16
and 2.6 percent in Q3CY15. However, strong solvency remains intact as CAR has further strengthened by
70 bps to reach 16.8 percent as of September 30, 2016.

Corporate sector must strengthen institutional mechanism
for pooling philanthropic contributions: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has stressed upon the
corporate sector to further build the institutional mechanism for pooling philanthropic
contributions from individuals and corporations to address the social issues on a greater scale.

Speaking as a Chief Guest at a ceremony for distribution of Pakistan Corporate
Philanthropy Awards and launching of Corporate Philanthropy Report 2010 at a local hotel in
Karachi this afternoon, he observed that these efforts would feed into the overall competitive
context of the corporate sector, enabling the companies to leverage the efforts and
infrastructure for the development of the nation.

‘| would urge the corporate sector to move the narrow focus of Corporate Philanthropy
(CP) from a public relations tool to a vehicle for creating social value for long term impact, he
said, adding that the institutions must adopt a strategic approach to CP programs. ‘CP programs
must be well structured in terms of striking a balance between business needs and the
community’s preferences with a high focus on leveraging and harmonizing for scale,’ he
emphasized.

Mr. Anwar said that institutions must adopt CP focus and communication strategy, such
as through their annual reports and websites to give CP initiatives greater visibility among the
internal and external stakeholders. Besides, the institutions also need to put in place verifiable
criteria for measuring and monitoring achievements of CP initiatives. ‘The criteria must
measure the impact on both dimensions of business performance and society’s well-being,’ he
added.

SBP Governor also stressed the need to develop a business case for CP initiatives. ‘The
business case may be developed on fundamentals such as strengthening corporate legitimacy
and reputation, building competitive advantage, and creating win-win situations through
synergistic value creation,’ he said, adding that the CP must seek partnerships to create
synergies with other philanthropists for scale and sustainability and long term impact on social
indicators.

He said that according to the UNDP’s Human Development Report 2011, Pakistan is
among countries with the lowest human development program. The report places national
multidimensional poverty, which is a composite of several social indicators including health,
education and standard of living, at 49.4 percent of the population, he said, adding that given
this high level of social and economic deprivation, the corporate sector must rise to shoulder
the burden of development with the government.

PRIVATE TRAVEL EXCHANGE QUOTA TO INDIA ENHANCED
TO $2,100 PER PERSON DURING A CALENDER YEAR.
The State Bank of Pakistan has with immediate effect enhanced the Private
Travel Exchange Quota (PTEQ) to India to US$50 per person per day subject to a
maximum of US$ 2100 during a calendar year. Previously, the Pakistanis travelling to

India were allowed only US$25 per person per visit.

amount of exchange quota from the banks (Authorized Dealers), which is applicable

to the rest of the countries of the world.

The State Bank’s decision will also help the persons travelling from

Muzaffarabad to Srinager through bus service.

State Bank forms committees to scale-up warehouse receipt financing mechanism, and
increase agri-credit in under-served provinces

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced formation of two
separate committees to scale-up warehouse receipt financing mechanism, and increased agri-credit in
under-served provinces and regions. He was addressing a Mid Term Review Meeting of the Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) for FY 2014-15 in Faisalabad today.

“During first seven months of FY 2014-15, banks have disbursed Rs.256 Billion of agricultural credit and
achieved 51% of the annual Agriculture Credit Disbursement Target which is Rs. 500 billion. This is an
increase of 35% compared to the disbursement made during the same period last year”. Mr. Wathra
shared with the participants. He congratulated the banks for their remarkable performance.

Mr. Wathra said that the performance of agriculture credit growth is on track, and sector is poised to
achieve over 53% of the agriculture credit demand in FY 2014-15 compared to only 39% in FY 2009-10.
Pointing out the gradual reduction of agri-credit demand-supply gap over the recent years, Mr. Wathra
urged up the banks to do more to further reduce this gap. He asserted that agriculture based growth has
positive and far-reaching influence on poverty alleviation, food security, export income and employment.

ACAC expressed the satisfaction over improvement in non-performing loans which has come down to all-
time low 11.4% alongside positive growth trends in banks’ agri-credit disbursements. ACAC was informed
that presently 33 financial institutions were proving agri credit in the country, compared with 20
Participating Financial Institutions in 2010. As a result, private sector banks including microfinance banks
are increasingly meeting financing needs of the agriculture sector.

Speaking to the audience, Mr. Wathra reiterated State Bank and government’s commitment in promoting
agriculture finance through inclusive and broad-based initiatives. He appreciated improving market trend
from being predominantly state-sponsored to being more open and market-led. He admired the
transformation brought about by diverse, strong, and forward-looking financial institutions. He also
appreciated the banks’ collective efforts in improving areas like product-mix, portfolio quality, and use of

Monetary Policy Statement
March 21, 2015

Increasing number of economic indicators in the current fiscal year have moved in a favorable
direction. Headline CPI inflation continues to follow a downward trajectory and is expected to
be well below the annual target of 8.0 percent; latest SBP projection range is 4-5 percent for
average CPI inflation in FY15. At the same time, GDP growth is on course to surpass the FY14
outcome. Owing to recent foreign exchange inflows and lower oil price, external sector outlook
continues to improve. Government's efforts to contain the fiscal deficit have been on track in
the first half of FY15, despite slightly slower growth in revenue collection. IBA-SBP survey-
based indices of March 2015 report increase in consumer confidence and in current economic
conditions. The current macroeconomic stabilization has thus opened a window of opportunity
to gear up reforms to ensure improvements in the economy are sustainable.

As per the recent trend, moderation in inflation is broad-based with food and non-food
inflations receding, both the measures of core inflation, Non-Food Non-Energy and Trim-Mean,
are also recording decline. However, due to current decline in inflation in general and
commodity prices in particular, there could be an increase in aggregate demand which may
have inflationary repercussions beyond FY15.

After growing by 2.2 percent in Jul-Jan FY15, Large-scale Manufacturing is likely to gain
traction due to recent cut in policy rate and low prices of raw materials that could boost the
manufacturing sector. In the agriculture sector, improved outcomes in major kharif crops (cotton
and rice, in particular) and incentives in place along with favorable weather conditions for rabi
season wheat crop, GDP growth is expected to be higher than that of FY14.

With strong workers’ remittances and declining import growth, current account deficit has
shrunk in Jul-Feb period of FY15 as compared to same period last year. The improvement is in
spite of subdued exports performance. Nonetheless, with lower price impact in imports and
multilateral inflows on track, the external sector outlook remains stable. This is most visible in
the stability in foreign exchange market and in an upward trajectory in foreign exchange
reserves.

During Jul-Feb FY15 period, Net Domestic Assets decreased and Net Foreign Assets increased,
which is a welcome development in contrast to the trends in the same period last year. The
Year-on-Year growth in broad money (M2) by February 27, 2015 was 11.5 percent; lower than
the average growth of 13.6 percent in the past five years. This deceleration is largely due to
contraction in Net Domestic Assets of the banking system. Growth in credit to private sector
during Jul-Feb FY15 has also remained subdued at RS 158.9 billion compared to RS 298.3 billion

Governor SBP steers the third Stakeholders Meeting on Digital Financial Services

 

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) organized the third nationwide Stakeholders’ meeting on Digital
Financial Services today chaired by Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir. The goal of these meetings has been
to accelerate the agenda on promoting digital financial services and payments in Pakistan. The meeting
was attended by the Country Director World Bank; Secretary MOITT; Accountant General of Pakistan
Revenue (AGPR); Secretary BISP; representatives from NADRA, PTA, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
(BMGF), Karandaaz; and, CEOs/Presidents of Banks, Telcos and Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs),
and several other stakeholders.

Governor Baqir briefed the forum about the significant progress made since the last stakeholder’s
consultative meeting and the important steps taken by SBP to facilitate digital payments. He said that
the development of Pakistan’s Instant Payments System project powered by SBP in collaboration with
its partners has progressed significantly and the Prime Minister of Pakistan will soon launch the
completion of its first phase. This phase will enable instant transfer of dividend payments directly into
the bank accounts of investors by Central Depository Company (CDC). Governor Baqir remarked that
the completion of this phase in a reasonable time despite disruptions due to Covid19 is commendable
and SBP appreciated the continuous support of its partners and other stakeholders. He also highlighted
that various other initiatives accelerating the pace of digitization in the country. He said the successful
introduction of digital account opening and provision of lifestyle banking and investments by banks
through the Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) for Non-resident Pakistanis is a giant step forward. Adding
further, he said that SBP has also fast tracked the licensing application process for EMls which will help
to accelerate digital payments by the non-bank players. To facilitate cross-border flows of retail
payments and venture capital funds SBP has also made amendments in the Foreign Exchange manual
to make it easier to make payments, he said.

Governor SBP thanked the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their local representative Karandaaz
Pakistan, SBP’s implementation partner, McKinsey Pakistan, and technology partner CMA who
provided their full support despite challenges of the Covid, travel ban and others to accelerate work on
Pakistan’s instant payments system. Governor Baqir also appreciated the AGPR for their interest in
leveraging the instant payment system platform for Salaries and Pension disbursements and BISP for
their interest in routing Ehsaas Program payments via this platform.

During the meeting, SBP also shared its plans for ensuring affordable access to digital financial services
for discussion. In this regard, SBP apprised the stakeholders on the progress made in finalizing the
charges for digital channels such as Inter Bank Funds Transfers (IBFT). Suggestions and feedback were
sought from the participants who largely appreciated the efforts of SBP catalyzing the spread of digital

financial services in the country, which is beneficial for both the financial institutions and public.

ADVANCES AGAINST SUGAR: SBP EXTENDS
DEADLINE UPTO 315"" OCTOBER, 2006

The State Bank of Pakistan has extended the deadline of adjusting advances
against the security of sugar stocks upto 31 October, 2006. However, this extension
will only be applicable to such financing facilities whose expiry date is after 31% July,
2006.

A decision to this effect was taken by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar who chaired two separate meetings of the Chief Executives of
banks/DFIs and a delegation of Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) at SBP
Karachi today.

Both the banks and the PSMA pointed out to the SBP Governor that the Sugar
Mills had not been able to liquidate their advances till 31 July, 2006 due to a number
of problems being faced by the millers. They said that as per normal cycle loans
against sugar are generally repaid by October every year

The PSMA delegation welcomed the decision of the Governor for extending
the deadline. The delegation assured the Governor that the advances against sugar
stocks would definitely be liquidated by the extended deadline.

The Governor asked the banks/DFls to reduce their loans by 1/3""? every month
to ensure full adjustment of their advances against the security of sugar stocks by the
extended deadline i.e. 31 October, 2006. She said the progress in this respect will be
closely monitored by the State Bank through the weekly statements which banks/DFIs
would submit to it (SBP).

The Governor also allowed the banks/DFIs to extend financing facilities
against the securities of imported sugar without 50% cash margin requirement. But
she pointed out that such financing should be adjusted within 45 days of the
disbursement of funds.

BPD Circular No.10 dated 31"" July, 2006 issued in this regard to the

presidents/chief executives of all banks is enclosed.

Responsible Banking Conduct is an imperative for
Sustainable Growth: Deputy Governor, SBP

Deputy Governor, State Bank Mr. Saeed Ahmad has called for a cultural transformation in banks to

ensure responsible banking conduct as a prerequisite of persistent inclusive growth.

Mr. Ahmad was giving his inaugural address in a seminar titled, “Responsible Banking Conduct” at
National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) Islamabad. The Deputy Governor stated that the
foundation of financial consumer protection must ideally rest on self regulation where banks have it in
their conscience a clear concern in nurturing well informed consumers capable of making right and

sustainable choices.

He stressed that responsible banking conduct cannot be achieved merely by ring-fencing consumer
protection within the compliance function. Instead, the entire bank — right from the board to the
frontline managers — has to be responsive to this objective. The Deputy Governor further emphasized
that in order to win the trust of stakeholders; consumers must not only be treated fairly but be seen to

be treated fairly.

Mr. Ahmad added that customer empowerment is part of SBP financial inclusion strategy and it will
devote adequate resources to implement the strategy; however banks also need to join us and augment

our efforts to promote financial literacy and consumer awareness.

SBP Deputy Governor stresses upon banks to
promote SMEs through prudent banking solutions

Kazi Abdul Muktadir, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has stressed upon
the banks to promote Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through prudent banking solutions.

‘| would stress the financial industry to break-out of the tendency of lending to
conventionally profitable and relatively safer sectors, and move towards promoting SMEs
through prudent banking solutions, he said in his key-note address on ‘““Engaging the SMEs to
Stabilize Economy” at the 6 SME Banking Conference at a local hotel in Karachi today.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir said that banks need to shift from traditional banking approach
towards SMEs by developing and implementing appropriate credit evaluation techniques, used
globally, such as credit scoring, cash flow & program based lending, ’ he added.

He said that SMEs would greatly benefit the financial institutions themselves as SMEs
will grow into larger corporations, resulting in increased business opportunities for them.
‘Banks need to remember that their industry is only as strong as the underlying economy,’ he
emphasized.

SBP Deputy Governor said there exists strong evidence that SMEs expansion boosts
employment more than large firm growth due to the fact that SMEs are normally more labour
intensive. ‘In Pakistan, the SME sector contributes 30 percent towards the country’s GDP,
employ more than 70 percent of the non-agricultural workforce, accounts for 35 percent of the
value added in the manufacturing industry and generates 25 percent in the export earnings.
The sector has huge potential in generating employment and alleviation of poverty in the
country,’ he added.

Keeping in view the specific business dynamics of the sector, SBP issued specific
Prudential Regulations (PRs) for SMEs in 2003 that greatly helped banks to focus on SME
financing and accordingly align their business strategies, he said and added that these
Prudential Regulations for SMEs do not make it mandatory for banks to require collateral but
allow them to take cash flow generation as the basis for loan approval. ‘We have always been
open to any suggestion from the sector for further improvement and strengthening of these
regulations, he added.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir said the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Small and Rural Enterprises
launched by the State Bank has been highly successful as over 64% of the guarantee limits
allocated to banks have been utilized by them.

PRESIDENT’S VISIT TO THE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

President, Pervez Musharraf visited the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today to seek a
briefing on the State of Pakistan’s Economy from SBP Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar. In
her presentation, the SBP Governor covered the areas of economic growth, inflation,
monetary policy, fiscal and external imbalances, exchange rate and macroeconomic stability.

She underscored that Pakistan like other countries is facing economic stress and challenging
policy scenarios. International financial market turmoil, starting in the US, has now caused a
global economic slowdown, which in turn is adversely impacting the growth prospects of
most Asian and Emerging Market Countries including Pakistan.

She further said that the rising international fuel and commodity prices have considerably
increased the pressures on balance of payments, fiscal accounts and inflation outlook. This is
not only true for Pakistan but also for most of the emerging and developed economies. The
Governor explained that high inflation is economically and socially costly. It adversely
affects investment and growth, creates uncertainty, and erodes peoples’ purchasing power,
particularly of low income group. In this context, Governor highlighted that Pakistan as well
as a number of developing and developed countries are pursuing tight monetary policy to
contain inflation and to mitigate its adverse impacts for long term growth prospects.

Referring to the key policy actions for restoring macroeconomic stability and sustaining
growth, the SBP Governor stressed that the monetary tightening is essential to reduce demand
pressures, which is to be supplemented by fiscal tightening. Besides need for adherence to
fiscal target for FYO9, as enumerated in the budget, in coming years revenue deficit should be
converted into a surplus, as laid down in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act
2005. The Governor added that the key concerns of the SBP are high stress of the
Government borrowings and drain on foreign exchange reserves due to confluence of
domestic and international developments highlighted above.

Dr Akhtar complemented the Government for its decision to reduce the borrowings from SBP
to net zero. She also valued the Government commitment to further work with SBP to reduce
the existing stock of government borrowing from the central bank.

To finance the current account deficit, financing has to be secured through increase in
domestic savings in order to reduce reliance on external financing, the Governor said. She
also pointed out the importance of restoring investors’ confidence with a view to encourage
investment inflows and consistency and continuation of prudent policies.

President Musharraf discussed various issues related to food and oil price developments and
appreciated the SBP’s briefing. He also acknowledged the strengths of SBP as an institution,
its policy advice and its continued support in overall economic development of the country.

The presentation ceremony was attended, among others, by Sindh Governor, Dr Ishratul Ibad
and senior management of the State Bank of Pakistan.

STATE BANK DELEGATES POWERS TO BANKS

In pursuance of its policy to delegate powers to the banks so that they can make
business and operational decisions on their own without prior approval of the
regulatory authorities, the State Bank has with immediate effect withdrawn twenty-six
Circulars and two Circular Letters, which were issued during 1969 to 2001. These
circulars have become redundant not only with the passage of time but also with the
issuance of a complete set of guidelines/instructions under three separate set of
Prudential Regulations for Corporate / Commercial Banking, SME Financing and
Consumer Financing. Further, with the liberalization, deregulation and privatization
of the financial sector, the instructions contained in these Circulars and Circular
Letters have lost their utility. The list of the Circular/ Circular Letters, which have
been cancelled/withdrawn, is attached with BPD Circular No.28 of 22""! October,
2005. This Circular (BPD Circular No.28 of 22""! October, 2005) is available on our

SBP makes mandatory for all banks to install at least
one ATM while opening new branch from next year

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has made it mandatory for all banks operating in the
country to add at least one Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in their network while opening a
new branch in a Calendar Year (CY) from next year.

This directive has been issued to banks with a view to improving the coverage ratio of
ATMs (the number of ATMs per branch) and to meet the minimum international standards.

Effective from CY 2013 onwards, all banks shall add one ATM in their network against
each new branch to be opened in a CY, according to BPRD Circular No. 03 issued to the
Presidents/Chief Executives of all banks today.

The banks having less than 1:1 ATM per branch ratio shall cover their existing gap in 5
years starting from CY 2013 @ 20% each year. For this purpose, all the banks shall submit a five
year plan to SBP latest by November 30, 2012. The progress in this regard would be reported to
SBP on quarterly basis.

Non-compliance of these directives would make the concerned bank(s) ineligible for
future branch expansion in addition to any other appropriate penal action under the relevant
law.

To address operational problems being currently faced by banks relating to ATMs,
separate instructions would shortly be issued by the Payment Systems Department of the State
Bank of Pakistan, the Circular added.

State Bank of Pakistan employing all available

resources to curb menace of counterfeit currency

Recently the issue of counterfeit currency notes in circulation was discussed during a briefing given by a team from
SBP to the Senate’s Standing Committee on Finance. During the briefing the Chairman of the committee asked the
SBP team to look into the complaints by public about them having received such notes from some banks. It is
unfortunate that the issue was highlighted out of proportion in a section of the media with the connotation that
banks are involved in injecting counterfeit currencies in circulation systematically. The State Bank categorically
rejects any such news items and clarifies that the views expressed in the meeting have wrongly been presented in
the media.

The presence of counterfeit currencies is an undeniable fact not only in our country but across the globe and SBP
being cognizant of the issue has been taking necessary measures to deal with this menace.

While the primary responsibility to check the influx of counterfeit notes lies with the Law Enforcement Agencies
(LEAs), SBP has adopted a three pronged strategy to manage this risk. The strategy aims at: i) ensuring state of the
art security features in our banknotes, which are difficult to counterfeit; ii) developing necessary capacity and
infrastructure with banks to issue genuine and authenticated banknotes to the public; and iii) creating awareness
amongst general public about the security features of our banknotes. Following the strategy SBP has issued new
series of banknotes between 2005-2008 with significantly enhanced security features comparable with those of
Euro, Pound Sterling, and US Dollar.

In order to ensure that banks issue genuine and authenticated banknotes to the public, they are required to issue
only sorted cash to the public from their cash counters and ATMs. The cash received in the branches cannot be
issued unless sorted. Bulk of the sorting activity is, however, manual and vulnerable to human errors. To improve
this capacity, SBP has advised banks to install banknotes authentication and sorting machines. From 24 January
2017 the banks will only be issuing machine authenticated banknotes from their branches and ATMs.

To lead by example, SBP is also installing state of the art high speed banknote processing machines in its subsidiary
SBP-BSC, besides using the desk top note sorting machines. This measure will significantly improve the banking
system’s capacity to check the currency counterfeiting.

Also, SBP uses different measures to create awareness amongst general public about the security features of
Pakistani banknotes. Campaigns under the title “Rupae Ko Pechano” are run occasionally under which public
awareness programs are held across the country, besides newspaper advertisements, website pages, and placement
of posters at banks’ branches, SBP-BSC offices and other important public places. Recently, a short documentary on
the security features of the banknotes has been prepared, which is being launched during the current month.
Moreover, a smart phone application has also been developed to enable the general public to have complete
information about security features of banknotes on their finger tips. During the briefing to Senate’s standing
committee meeting, the committee was shown the documentary and apprised about the mobile application. The
committee was highly appreciative of the initiative and recommended the government to declare it a public service
message for its free of cost display on TV channels.

The success of these initiatives in minimizing the currency counterfeiting will, among others, also depend on public
cooperation in reporting of fake banknotes to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). People are hesitant in reporting
about finding fake currencies to LEAs to avoid procedural and behavioral difficulties. Reporting by the people is an
important step towards helping LEAs to apprehend the individuals/groups involved in the menace of currency

counterfeiting.

SBP releases First Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its First Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s
Economy for FY19. According to the report, the overall macroeconomic environment remained
challenging during the first quarter of FY19 as suggested by the preliminary data. The primary
concern was the steep rise in global crude prices, which not only reinforced the already strong
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy, but also eclipsed emerging improvements in the
external sector. Fiscal pressures also remained intact as expenditure rigidities allowed only a limited
room for the government to maneuver. Responding to these challenges, the new political regime
immediately announced cuts in development spending, partially reversed tax relief measures, and
also explored avenues to bridge the external financing gap.

According to the report, the 6.2 percent target for real GDP growth seems unachievable with the
policy focus now tilted towards macroeconomic stabilization. The production of all major kharif crops
remained lower as compared to the last season, due to lower water availability, which led to a decline
in the total area under production. Furthermore, crop yields suffered due to subdued fertilizer
offtake amidst rising prices of both urea and DAP. The large-scale manufacturing also contracted by
1.7 percent during Q1-FY19, after recording a healthy growth of 9.9 percent during Q1-FY18.
Noticeably, the output of construction-allied and consumer durable segments, which were the major
drivers of growth last year, decelerated on a YoY basis.

The report highlighted that with the underlying inflationary pressures remaining strong and the twin
deficits staying at elevated levels, the monetary policy continued to move along the adjustment path.
During the two Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings that were held during the quarter, the
policy rate was raised by a cumulative 200 basis points. Besides the persistence of strong demand
pressures, the second-round impact of higher fuel prices and exchange rate depreciation pushed up
core inflation. As for private credit, a strong expansion was observed during Q1-FY19, in contrast to
net retirements witnessed in the same quarter last year. The activity in working capital loans was
more prominent, since rising commodity prices and input costs increased the financing requirements
of businesses.

The report also observed that the consolidated revenues grew by 7.5 percent during the quarter;
however, this pace was lower than the 18.9 percent uptick witnessed during Q1-FY18. Expenditures
grew by 11.0 percent during the quarter compared to 13.5 percent in the same period last year. The
resultant higher fiscal deficit was financed through increased government borrowing from both
domestic and external sources.

On the external front, the report highlighted that the continued exports growth and a steady increase
in workers’ remittances partially helped contain the current account deficit. However, the level of
this deficit remained a concern, as rising oil prices resulted in the quarterly import bill crossing the
USS 4.0 billion mark. With foreign investments declining on a YoY basis and external borrowing by
the private sector remaining subdued, the financial inflows proved insufficient. Resultantly, pressure
on the balance of payments continued to mount, with the country’s FX reserves declining by USS 1.4
billion and the PKR depreciating by 2.2 percent during the quarter. Nonetheless, financing of the
current account might improve going forward as there is an expectation of receiving higher foreign

SBP sets indicative target of Rs260 billion for
agricultural credit disbursement in FY10

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan today said that the central bank has set
an indicative target of Rs 260 billion for agricultural credit disbursement in the current fiscal year
(2009-10).

While chairing a meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held at the
State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this morning, Mr. Raza emphasized that in spite of structural shift
towards industrialization, agriculture sector is still the largest sector of the economy having deep
impact on socio-economic set-up. It is also the source of livelihood of at least 45 % of the total
employed labour force in the country. However, despite 22 % contribution in GDP, agriculture
sector has only 4.6% share in banks’ credit portfolio which is not an encouraging picture.

‘Adequate availability & access to institutional credit is essential for accelerating the pace of
agriculture development to ensure food security and poverty alleviation in the country’, Mr Raza added.

Mr Raza pointed out that high agri. NPLs, cumbersome & lengthy lending procedures, lack
of Agri. Finance Officers, innovative agri. finance products, banks’ management interest, farmers’
awareness about banks’ financial services, marketing & storage facilities, issues of passbook and
non-automation of land record; low yield, inordinate delays in payment of agri. products by mills,
ineffective implementation of government’s support price etc. are the major bottlenecks in agri.
financing.

SBP Governor emphasized upon the banks to revamp & re-structure their agri. lending
mechanism by adopting modern & innovative techniques to boost agricultural financing. In
addition, the government needs to devise the policy for introduction of corporate / cooperative
farming to enable the majority of (86% of the total farms) farmers of the country to have the
benefits of access to financial resources, new technology, quality inputs, marketing & storage
facilities etc. “Indeed, this would result in higher production and income to small farmers,” he
added.

He informed the meeting that despite unfavourable economic & market conditions in FY
09, banks were able to achieve more than 93 % of agri. credit disbursement target of Rs 250
billion. In absolute terms, banks disbursed Rs 233 billion with an increase of Rs 21.4 billion or 10%
over the disbursement of Rs 211.6 billion in FYO8. The major chunk of farm credit was availed by
the small farmers (subsistence holding) as their share in farm credit increased from 59% to 63%.

Mr Raza briefed the participants of the meeting about SBP initiatives and other various
activities in FYO9 including implementation of mandatory Crop Loan Insurance Scheme,
awareness programs/melas for farmers, training of more than 600 Agri. Field Officers of banks
under One Week Crash Training Program, enhancement of an average of 70% per acre credit limit
for major and minor crops from Rabi crop 2008-09, development of Benazir Zarai Card and Tractor
Finance Scheme, launch of Pilot Project for increasing agri. credit on fast track basis in 7 agri.

SBP issues minimum standards for sale

of third party products by banks/ DFls

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued minimum standards for the sale of third
party products by banks/ development finance institutions (DFls) to safeguard the interest of
the depositors/general public and prevent banks from incurring operational and reputational
risks.

‘Banks offering third party products must establish a centralized control function
entrusted with the responsibility to verify the information given in a sales proposal/application
forwarded by the sales staff. It is up to the banks how to structure the requisite control
function, however the underlying principle is that the person verifying the information should
not have any incentive linked with the sales volume,’ SBP said in its CPD Circular No. 2 of 29
June, 2012 issued to the Presidents/Chief Executives of all scheduled banks/DFls.

In addition to the existing set of documents, banks shall introduce a basic fact sheet
elaborating at least the following facts:
i. Two liner definition of the product.
ii. Disclaimer of the bank stating that it is only working in the capacity of a
distributor.
iii. | Return mechanism in terms of investment and premium schedule in terms of
bancassurance.
iv. Free look period in case of bancassurance.
v. Premature encashment procedure and its repercussions.
vi. | Redressal Mechanism in case of any grievance.
vii. Checklist of all the other documents signed or attached.

The basic fact sheet should be a distinct looking document including an undertaking by
the customer that he/she understands all the stated terms and conditions of the product. This
document, along with all the other documents, shall be printed in both Urdu & English with a
font size not smaller than 10.

Banks must institute a call back confirmation mechanism equipped with the Integrated
Voice Response system whereby every customer is contacted, briefed about the salient
features of the product and his/her confirmation is obtained before approving a sales proposal,
the Circular said.

To ensure that the bank has proper evidence of the fact that the investor was duly
briefed about the product and related terms/conditions, the record of every call made should

Financial exclusion hindering people in availing opportunities:

Acting Governor SBP

Acting Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, has said that financial
exclusion is hindering our fellow citizens in availing economic and business opportunities. Speaking
at the Bank Alfalah Mobile Commerce Conference in Karachi today, he said that an estimated 2.5

billion adult people worldwide did not have access to formal financial services.

He said that Pakistan’s branch network of almost 12,700 was insufficient to serve the millions of
unbanked masses. “Banks operating in Pakistan are hosting only 35 million customer accounts
including 3.5 million accounts opened by branchless banking providers. Despite phenomenal spread
of banking business in Pakistan, we have a long way to go to achieve digital financial inclusion the

in country.”

Mr. Wathra further said that given the complexities and challenges of limited financial access in the
country, SBP had adopted a multi-pronged and long-term strategy to address financial exclusion

through structured policy & regulatory actions, and market-development interventions.

He pointed out that Pakistan was amongst the pioneers of mobile/branchless banking in the
developing world. “This could not have been possible without an effective and enabling regulatory
regime, dynamic, innovative and always eager banking and telecom industry in the country,” he
added.

He added that SBP was focusing its energies to identify gaps and bring solutions to address those
gaps. He told the audience that SBP had formed the National Branchless Banking Consultative
Group with representation from branchless banking industry players including banks, mobile
operators, and technology service providers. “This group is actively working on different protocols
including agent code of conduct, agent sharing models, interoperability schemes and consumer

protection framework”.

Harnessing technology platforms is the way forward for enhancing agricultural
productivity- Governor SBP

“| would urge the stakeholders including banks, federal and provincial governments to
harness technology platforms for enhancing agricultural productivity”, said Tariq Bajwa,
Governor State Bank of Pakistan while presiding the mid-term review meeting of Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held in Hyderabad on 7th February, 2019.

“Holding ACAC meetings at various locations shows our commitment for promoting
agricultural financing in all regions, especially in underserved areas. While, previous meetings
were held in Baluchistan and AJK, we are convening this meeting for the first time in
Hyderabad to provide impetus for agricultural finance in the region”, expressed Governor in
his inaugural remarks. While reviewing the progress on agricultural credit during July-
December 2018, the Governor appreciated the efforts of banks in promoting agricultural
finance. The Governor shared that during the first half of FY 2018-19, banks have disbursed
Rs. 527.3 billion, which is 42.2% of the total assigned target for FY 2018-19, and 22% higher
than the disbursement made during the same period last year. The outstanding portfolio of
agri. credit also increased to Rs. 521 billion at end December 2018 from Rs. 442 billion last
year, witnessing a growth of 17.9%. Moreover, the number of outstanding borrowers also
increased to 3.90 million at end December 2018 from 3.46 million last year, with a growth of
12.8%. The Chair also appreciated the efforts of microfinance banks and institutions in
providing financing to small and marginalized farmers.

Governor Bajwa, pointed out that despite witnessing reasonable progress during FY 2018-19,
the industry still faces various demand and supply side challenges. In particular, he
highlighted the geographical disparities in provision of agri. credit as the disbursements in
KPK, Balochistan and GB which still remain far from their respective targets. Like-wise, banks
were advised to pay special focus on production loans for small farmers. He also emphasized
banks to enhance their outreach in terms of agricultural infrastructure by hiring agriculture
credit officers. The Governor also highlighted the efforts of Islamic banks in achieving a
growth of 80% in disbursement during July-December 2018 compared to the same period
last year, however, their share in total disbursement still remains less than 3% in overall agri.
credit.

Investment by International Investors in Debt markets

There are several misconceptions about the implications of international investors’ investments in
the debt markets of Pakistan. State Bank of Pakistan would like to clarify as under:

1.

International investors have been investing in Pakistan’s equity markets for a long time. Such
investments are considered portfolio investments, just like investments in debt instruments,
and use the same framework of Special Convertible Rupee Account (SCRA). Such investors
have been able to move capital in and out of our financial markets without problems for the
Pakistan economy.

Recently, international investors have started investing in debt instruments issued by the
government of Pakistan. This is largely a manifestation of their growing confidence in the
positive outlook for the economy. As endorsed by international financial institutions,
including the IMF, the ADB and the World Bank, and rating agencies, our reform program is
beginning to show results. One key aspect of this reform program has been the shift to a
market based exchange rate system since May 2019 which has addressed previous concerns
regarding the sustainability of the exchange rate regime. Together with the continued
improvement in our balance of payments and reserve buffers, this has raised the comfort
level of international investors to invest in local currency denominated financial assets. It
should be noted that interest rates have been higher in the past—for example interest rates
were around 13.75 percent on average in FY11—but our debt markets did not attract interest
from international investors.

Investment in government securities by international investors provides several benefits to
the economy. First, such investment helps to deepen capital markets by increasing the pool
of funds available in the local market and diversifies the investor-base. Second, such
investment helps to allow banks to deploy available funds for lending to the private sector
since there is growing competition from international investors for placements in
government securities. Third, such interest by international investors raises the demand for
government securities and accordingly lowers yields and reduces the cost of borrowing for
the government. Fourth, the growing role of international investors in the local debt market
may serve as a positive feedback mechanism for further improving domestic practices,
policies, systems and institutions in line with international best practices.

At the same time risks posed by such investments are limited at current levels on account of
the following reasons. First, the current level of such investments at $1.2 billion accounts for
less than 2 percent of the total outstanding marketable government securities and less than
0.5% of GDP. Second, this investment accounts for less than one-fifth of the increase in SBP’s
net reserve buffers at current levels; the bulk of the increase in the net reserve buffers is
accounted for by the continued current account improvement. Third, the tenor of such
investments has been increasing with more investments in longer dated instruments as
investors’ confidence grows. Finally, the simplification of taxation for investment in

Mr. Yaseen Anwar asks banks to adopt
agri. financing as viable business model

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has urged upon the banks to adopt
agricultural financing as viable business model through development of specific products/ schemes and
disseminate best practices through grass-root level programs for farmers.

Presiding over a meeting of Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) at SBP, Karachi today, he
said the relevant federal & provincial government departments, farmers’ representatives and other players in
value chain also need to create credit absorption capacity of farmers through adoption of best modern farming
practices, development of storage & marketing systems and resolution of other real side issues.

He said that heavy rains of 2011 and devastating floods in 2010 have greatly affected the national
economy in general and agriculture sector in particular. The credit requirements of farmers have also increased
significantly besides adjustment of existing agricultural loans, he said, adding that agriculture remains the
mainstay with a contribution of more than 21% to the GDP and around 60% of the population depends on
agriculture related activities for its livelihood.

SBP Governor said that banks need to develop a comprehensive agricultural finance policy for
settlement, rescheduling & restructuring of loans of the affected borrowers in addition to providing fresh
credits for the rehabilitation and revival of the economic activities in the affected areas. ‘The federal &
provincial governments would also need to initiate support & relief packages for the affected areas’, he added.

Mr. Anwar said that in order to ensure timely and quick loan disbursement to help the agriculture
sector and revival of economic activities in the affected areas, SBP in collaboration with banks has taken a
number of initiatives including Refinance Scheme at discounted rates of 8% coupled with Credit Guarantee
Scheme for loss sharing of banks up to 40%. ‘Banks were also allowed to restructure the existing loans and
write-offs in cases where the recovery of loans is not possible’, Mr. Anwar added.

He said the crop loan insurance scheme introduced by the government for production loans for five
major crops has also supported the sector whereby claims of around Rs 800 million (including around Rs 550
million of the borrowers of ZTBL) have been settled by insurance companies in 2010 and 2011.

He pointed out that agricultural credit is highly skewed towards farm sector i.e. around 68% whereas
credit to non form sector including livestock sector is only 32% as compared with its contribution of 55% to
agriculture GDP.

The SBP Governor announced the setting up of an Implementation Committee to ensure timely
implementation of the action plan prepared by the ACAC Special Committee, constituted in December, 2010.

RCG Asia meeting--Governor SBP for effective
implementation of Macroprudential Policy Framework

Governor State Bank of Pakistan(SBP) Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra emphasized on the need for
implementing the macroprudential policy framework in line with international best practices to limit
systemic risk facing the financial system during the meeting of Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional
Consultative Group Asia (RCG Asia). Governor Wathra, while sharing his views on macroprudential
policy(MPP) and tools, highlighted that the MPP needs to be complemented by appropriate
monetary, fiscal and other financial sector policies.

Governor, Wathra was co-chairing the 11 meeting of FSB RCG-Asia alongside Mr. Norman T.L. Chan
Chief Executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The meeting was held in Hong Kong SAR today on
December 2, 2016. In July 2015, Governor Wathra was appointed as the co-chair of FSB-RCG Asia
along with Mr. Norman T.L. Chan for a two-year term. The co-chairs are responsible for hosting RCG
Asia meetings, conducting workshops, coordinating with the FSB Secretariat, and attending FSB
Plenary meetings.

FSB has been established to coordinate, at the international level, the work of national financial
authorities and international standard setting bodies and to develop and promote the
implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest
of financial stability. In addition to its own member countries, FSB, through six regional consultative
groups (RCGs), conducts outreach with around 65 other non-FSB member jurisdictions. Formed in
2011, the RCG Asia includes central banks and financial authorities of 16 jurisdictions including
Australia, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

The meeting also discussed vulnerabilities and financial stability issues covering high levels of US
dollar denominated private sector debt levels, movement in exchange rates and changes in US
monetary policy stance, and their potential implications for the region.

During the session on managing non-performing loans (NPLs), members shared their experiences how
financial institutions in Asia are identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling NPLs, and what
legal, regulatory or other hurdles impede their resolution. As part of this discussion, Mr. Jameel
Ahmed, Executive Director Banking Supervision Group, SBP briefed the participants on the Basel
Committee’s consultative document “Prudential treatment of problem assets - definitions of non-
performing exposures and forbearance”, in addition to sharing Pakistan’s experience in managing
problem loans.

The meeting also considered the impact of financial technology on retail payments systems, where
members discussed how the proliferation of fintech is improving accessibility and convenience in
retail payments, while highlighting increases in credit and operational risk. The members
contemplated appropriate regulatory approaches to foster sound and secure retail payment systems
while striking a balance between financial inclusion, customer convenience and financial stability.

Governor State Bank inaugurates conference on AML/CFT & trade-based money laundering

While inaugurating the conference on Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/ Combating Financing of
Terrorism (CFT) and Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor State Bank
stated that significant progress has been made between May and September 2019 to meet the action
plan items set by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in different areas to demonstrate effectiveness of
AML / CFT regime of Pakistan. “There was a major rethink of the approach being taken by the
authorities in early to mid 2019. Consequently, a number of steps were taken to significantly strengthen
our approach to making progress on these issues,” the Governor said. He however, stressed for the
need of putting more effort to make progress on remaining areas to ensure that Pakistan is out of grey
list in the next meeting of FATF.

He was speaking to the conference conducted by SBP and Asian Development Bank today at SBP,
Karachi in a collaborative effort to mitigate the risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism.

Speaking at the conference, the Governor informed the audience that since the grey-listing, State Bank
has arranged many AML/CFT outreach and awareness programs for its regulated entities and
stakeholders and that the conference is a useful platform to understand the AML/CFT challenges being
faced globally and the best practices followed in mitigating such challenges.

In the context of implementing AML/CFT requirements, the Governor urged the financial sector to
make efficient use of technologies for assessment of risks, controls and ongoing monitoring of financial
transactions and enhance capacity by continuous training of their employees.

Dr. Baqir emphasized that trade based money laundering poses complex and sophisticated challenges
and that SBP inspection teams conducted thematic inspections of banks with respect to export and
import of specific goods. He also referred to State Bank’s framework for managing risks of trade based
money laundering and terrorist financing which has been issued to encourage authorized dealers
(banks) to effectively manage the trade based money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

Ms. Xiohang Yang, Country Director ADB, and Mr. Mohsin Ali Nathani, President & CEO HABIBMETRO
Bank also spoke on the occasion. Ms. Yang stated that ‘AML/CFT is a critical issue for trade finance,
which is why ADB’s Trade Finance Program is playing an increasing role in this space. She stated that
ADB has a strong commitment to work with Pakistan’s banking sector and the SBP on this issue.

Ms. Yang further stated that the FATF has identified enhanced capacity building/training in AML/CFT
as an immediate priority requirement and they are pleased to partner with the SBP and thankful to
HABIBMETRO Bank for organizing the same.

Mr. Mohsin Ali Nathani, President & CEO HABIBMETRO Bank while addressing the conference added,
‘Enhancement of AML & CFT efforts through increased awareness and strengthened systems, controls
and processes is imperative for our country and the banking sector. HABIBMETRO Bank is pleased to
organize this conference and bring together relevant stakeholders from the region, regulator and
banking sector to re-affirm our collective commitment to mitigating the risks of Money Laundering and
Terrorism Financing.’

During the conference several prominent speakers and panelists discussed the requisites and
obligations with regard to AML and CFT, including Terrorism Financing Risk Assessments, Transnational
Risks in Trade Based Money Laundering (TBML), risks posed by DNFBPs & NPOs and Ultimate Beneficial

PRI-PIA alliance to help boost remittance inflows
through banking channels: Shaukat Tarin

Mr. Shaukat Tarin, the Federal Minister for Finance, has expressed the hope that strategic
alliance between Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would
contribute towards the enhancement of remittance flows through official channels and help the
Government to achieve the goal of formalizing the remittance market in the country.

Addressing a MoU signing ceremony between PRI and PIA held at State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi
today, Mr. Tarin urged the overseas Pakistanis to make sure that they are transferring their hard-earned
income through official channels into Pakistan. He said that he was confident that PRI would usher in a
new era in the realm of worker’s remittances and reach the ultimate destination of highest efficiency
and maximum satisfaction levels. “The performance of PRI has been commendable since its inception
and | am confident that they would continue to work with same commitment and dedication to achieve
the desired objectives,” he added.

Mr. Tarin said that the trend of remittances received in last five months of this fiscal year shows
an increase of around 30 percent over the similar period in the last fiscal year. However, he pointed out
that the success of PRI does not lie in month-to-month numbers, rather its objective is to lay the
foundation of a permanent structure whereby there would be: end-to-end efficient systems, maximum
satisfaction of remitter & beneficiary, highest degree of commitment of the financial sector, and the
inclusion of such ingredients into the policy framework for PRI whereby the consistent political will
should become a norm rather than an exception.

He said that there are a number of cyclical and environmental factors which affect the flow of
remittances in either way. Therefore, the performance of PRI cannot be judged from the month-to-
month numbers, at least in the short term, he said and added that their performance, however, will be
evaluated, amongst others, by the remittance flows in to the country in a given fiscal year.

Mr. Tarin highlighted the role of financial sector in the national cause of formalizing remittance
market in Pakistan and said that it is quite satisfactory to note that the banks have started to improve
their infrastructure and related systems with a view to offering better remittance services. He warned
the banking system about the symptoms of complacency. He advised the financial sector that they
should thoroughly review their existing customer base and immediately terminate the banking
relationship with those who are suspicious to be associated with illegal foreign exchange business. He
also applauded the role of law enforcement agencies, especially the FIA in taking stern actions against
illegal foreign exchange operators which has played a vital role in the rising trend of remittances in
Pakistan. “Accordingly, we have mutually decided to give monetary reward to FIA officials associated
with the law enforcement actions against illegal foreign exchange operators,” he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Farooq Sattar, the Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis, said
that it gives him immense pleasure to state that PRI is moving ahead with the plans and achieving the

SBP and PBA issue Relief Package
for households and businesses to cope with impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

 

Amid growing concerns about the potential economic impact of the COVID — 19 pandemic, State Bank
of Pakistan (SBP) with the collaboration of Pakistan Banks Association (PBA), has announced a
comprehensive relief package. This package will help relevant stakeholders including households and
businesses (microfinance, SMEs, corporates, commercial, retail, and agriculture) to manage their
finances through this temporary phase of disruption. Key highlights of the package are as follows:

Banks’ overall pool of loanable funds has been increased. To support the banking sector to supply
additional loans to businesses and households, SBP has reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)
from its existing level of 2.50% to 1.50%. This will enable banks to lend an additional amount of around
Rs. 800 billion, an amount equivalent to about 10% of their current outstanding loans. The reduced CCB
level will remain applicable till further instructions by SBP.

The regulatory limit on extension of credit to SMEs has been permanently increased. SMEs typically
bear the brunt of credit supply contractions during periods of heightened risk aversion and economic
downturn. Therefore, as a tool to incentivize banks to provide additional loans to retail SMEs, the
existing regulatory retail limit of Rs. 125 million per SME has been permanently enhanced to Rs. 180
million with immediate effect. This measure will facilitate banks to provide more loans to SMEs, which
currently stand at around Rs. 470 billion.

Borrowing limits for individuals have been increased for one year. The capacity to borrow from banks
for individuals is limited by their capacity to bear the burden of debt, defined in terms of a percentage
of their income and known as a Debt Burden Ratio (DBR). SBP has relaxed the DBR for consumer loans
from 50% to 60%. This measure will allow about 2.3 million individuals to borrow more from banks in
this time of need.

Payment of principal on loan obligations will be deferred by banks. Banks and DFls will defer the
payment of principal on loans and advances by one year. To avail this relaxation, borrowers should
submit a written request to the banks before 30"" June 2020. They will, however, continue to service
the mark-up amount as per agreed terms and conditions. The deferment of principal will not affect
borrower’s credit history and such facilities will also not be reported as restructured/rescheduled in
the credit bureau’s data. The total amount of principal coming due over the next year is about Rs. 4,700
billion.

Regulatory criteria for restructuring/rescheduling of loans have been temporarily relaxed till 31%
March 2021. For borrowers whose financial conditions require relief beyond extension of principal
repayment for one year, SBP has relaxed the regulatory criteria for restructuring/rescheduling of loans.
The loans that are re-scheduled/restructured within 180 days from the due date of payment will not
be treated as defaults. Banks would also not be required to suspend the unrealized mark-up against

Monetary Policy Statement
September 16, 2019

1. At its meeting on 16 September 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the
policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC’s view that inflation outcomes have
been largely as expected and inflation projections for FY20 have remained unchanged since the last MPC
meeting on 16% July, 2019. The MPC also viewed that, based on available information, the current stance of
monetary policy was appropriate to bring inflation down to the target range of 5 — 7 percent over the next
twenty-four months.

2. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key economic developments since the last MPC meeting,
developments in the teal, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and
inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

3. ‘The MPC noted two key developments since the last MPC meeting. First, the interbank foreign exchange
market had adjusted relatively well to the introduction of the market-based exchange rate system. The initial
volatility and associated uncertainty in the exchange market had subsided. Reflecting these improved
sentiments and continued adjustment in the current account, the rupee had strengthened modestly against the
US dollar since the last MPC, unlike its previous trend. Second, on the external front, the US Fed, as
anticipated, reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps), followed by policy rate cuts by other major central
banks around the world. This would help in lowering pressures on emerging markets’ currencies and
potentially increase financial inflows.

Real sector

4. Recent economic activity indicators show a gradual slowdown, in line with earlier expectations, and the
MPC continued to expect average growth in FY20 of around 3.5 percent. The slowdown is more pronounced
in domestic oriented industries such as automobiles and steel. This trend is also reflected in the Large-scale
Manufacturing (LSM) index which contracted by 3.6 percent in FY19, somewhat more than earlier
expectations. On the other hand, the MPC noted that the LSM index does not fully capture activity in some
key industries such as high value-added textile products. Export volumes have been growing briskly even
though the growth in export dollar proceeds has been less pronounced due to declining international unit
prices. The MPC also noted that the SBP-IBA Consumer and Business Confidence Surveys conducted during
Aug-Sep 2019 show a modest improvement in the outlook for the economy. The outlook for agriculture and
the services sectors was largely unchanged from the time of the previous MPC meeting. The agriculture
sector growth is expected to improve considerably in FY20 over the last fiscal year while growth in services is
expected to moderate gradually. In sum, the MPC continued to expect that economic activity would gradually
turn around as business sentiment improves.

External sector

5. ‘The external sector continued to show significant improvement with a sizeable reduction of around 32
percent (or 1.5 percent of GDP) in the current account deficit during FY19. The trend continued in the first
month of FY20 as well. Specifically, driven by an encouraging 11 percent growth in exports and a contraction
of 25.8 percent in imports, the current account deficit declined to US$ 579 million in July 2019 compared to
US$ 2,130 million in the same period last year. This, together with the disbursement of program related
inflows and activation of the Saudi oil facility, helped to build SBP’s foreign exchange reserves, which as of
6th September 2019, stood at US$ 8.46 billion. This is an increase of around US$ 1.18 billion from the end-

SBP extends time for settlement of Foreign
Currency Loans amid COVID-19 Pandemic

Continuing with its commitment to support the industry amid COVID-19 pandemic, SBP has further
facilitated the exporters and importers by allowing extension up to 180 days in settlement of their
export and import loans under FE-25 Scheme.

Banks can now allow extension up to 180 days to exporters in settlement of their FE-25 loans in case
they are facing delay inrealization of export proceeds due to COVID-19. Moreover, bankscan also allow
settlement of FE-25 loans to exporters through substitute contract during the extended period of 180
days where the original export contract has been cancelled due to COVID-19. Likewise, SBP has also
allowed the bank to extend the maturity of FE-25 import loans by 180 days. This facilitation has been
provided to exporter and importers for their foreign currency loans maturing up to September 30,
2020. For details http://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2020/FECL17.htm

 

State Bank reiterates its unflinching resolve to continue working with all stakeholders to provide all
needed facilitation in these uncertain times in the larger interest of people of Pakistan.

SBP provides further incentives for businesses to retain workers & employees and prevent layoffs

On April 10, 2020 the State Bank of Pakistan announced an incentive scheme— entitled Refinance
Scheme for Payment of Wages and Salaries to the Workers and Employees of Business Concerns —that
enables the provision of concessional credit for payroll finance to businesses that commit to not lay off
workers for the next three months. Today the SBP has introduced further incentives under this scheme
to support employment and avoid layoffs in the country. These additional incentives include relaxations
in collateral requirements, further reduction in end-user rate, reimbursement of wages, special
accounts for employees to receive wages, borrowing from banks other than maintaining payrolls,
simplification of application form for SMEs and bank’s exposure limits. These additional incentives are
effective as of today. Further information on these incentives is provided below and further details are

available at the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp

Based on feedback from stakeholders, SMEs including vendors and distributors were particularly facing
the problem of providing security/collateral. To address this issue, SBP has now allowed banks for
providing financing against corporate guarantees of companies in value / supply chain relationship with
the borrowers. Moreover, banks have also been encouraged to provide loans without any collateral i.e.
taking clean exposure of up to Rs 5 million.

SBP has enhanced the incentive to business which are active tax payers by reducing the mark up rate
for them to 3% that was set as 4% earlier. Now the SBP will provide refinance to banks at 0%. This also
increases the gap between the rates charged to active tax payer and the non-tax payers businesses, as
the latter can be charged an end user markup rate of up to 5%.

To facilitate employees for receiving wages under the scheme directly, banks have been allowed to
open their accounts on the information and documents provided by the employers along with an
undertaking stating that these persons are bonafide employees/workers. Banks will ensure verification
of the employees using NADRA Verisys before activation of such accounts. These accounts, however,
could be used solely for salary disbursement and withdrawal purposes only.

Businesses have also been given flexibility to avail loan under SBPs refinance scheme for wages from
any bank and they will not be limited to avail loans from the bank that manages their payroll. Further,
businesses will also be able to get reimbursement of salaries pertaining to the month of April 2020 that
have been disbursed through own sources, provided they have applied for financing under the scheme
before disbursement and the same is subsequently approved by the banks. SMEs can apply for the
financing on a simplified loan application form prescribed by SBP for this scheme.

To facilitate the banks further for lending under the scheme, Banks’ exposure under the scheme has
been exempted from the per-party or the per-group exposure limits. It will enable them to lend to
borrowers that have exhausted their exposure limits.

All these benefits will also be available to businesses availing financing under the scheme from Islamic
Banking Institutions.

Imposition of 100% Cash Margin on Import of Certain Consumer Items

State Bank of Pakistan, in exercise of powers entrusted to it under Banking Companies
Ordinance, 1962, has imposed 100% cash margin requirement on import of certain consumer
items. This regulatory measure would, interalia, discourage the import of these items and would
have nominal impact on the general public.

The requirement of 100% cash margin has been prescribed on items such as motor vehicles
(both CKDs and CBUs), mobile phones, cigarettes, jewelry, cosmetics, personal care, electrical &
home appliances, arms & ammunitions etc.

State Bank expects that this regulatory measure would help accommodate incremental import of

growth-inducing capital goods.

Branchless Banking shows impressive
growth in fourth quarter: SBP

Branchless banking (BB) has witnessed an impressive growth during the fourth quarter
(April — June 2012) of the last fiscal year 2011-12 as the number of mobile banking accounts
touched the figure of 1.45 million, depicting a remarkable growth of 37 percent.

According to SBP’s ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’, posted on its website today, the
accounts’ activity level has also improved considerably during the quarter under review as the
number of active accounts increased by 66 percent. Over 28 million transactions worth
Rs.115.3 billion were processed during the April — June quarter. The number and value of
transactions have grown rapidly during April — June quarter by 12% and 36% respectively. The
growth in value of transactions is almost 3 times more than the growth in number of
transactions. The overall average size of transaction has increased from Rs 3,367 to Rs 4,065
during the quarter under review. The agents’ network has risen to 29,525 on 30"" June, 2012
from 26,792 as on 31° March, 2012 registering an increase of 10 percent. The agents now have
presence in 90 percent of the districts in the country.

Bills payments & mobile top-ups remained the dominating activity with 50 percent share
in total numbers, followed by person to person (over the counter) fund transfers with share of 36
percent. Loan repayments of Rs.464 million primarily of microfinance institutions were collected
through BB agents during the quarter.

According to the Newsletter, the growth expectation in coming quarters is fairly high as
the existing two BB players are increasing their scale of operations and six other banks are in
pilot phase and are likely to start their BB operations shortly. Moreover, banks are exploring
avenues to increase the attractiveness of the m-wallets for their customers, and offering them
new services such as purchasing air-tickets, receiving salaries/ pensions, utilizing ATM through
debit cards, and internet banking.

State Bank Announces Measures to Facilitate Export—Oriented Sectors and Manufacturing
Concerns

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has extended the scope of Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) to cover all
permissible export oriented sectors. This step is aimed at setting up of diverse export oriented
projects in Pakistan and to boost exports in multiple sectors. Further, to accommodate enhanced
financing requirements of exporters for setting up long term export oriented projects, maximum limit
of Rs. 2.5 billion has been enhanced to Rs. 5 billion per project under LTFF.

In line with the above measure, SBP has also provided additional concessional financing of Rs.200
billion to banks including Rs. 100 billion under Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) and Rs. 100 billion
under Export Refinance Scheme (EFS), to be utilized by 30"" June 2020.

Going forward, to further promote SME exporters, SBP in consultation with the relevant stakeholders,
is in the process of devising an elaborate mechanism for the allocation of LTFF and EFS to SME
exporters. These changes are likely to be announced in March 2020.

Furthermore, with a view to facilitate importers, SBP has allowed banks to make advance payment up
to USD 10,000/-, or equivalent thereof, per invoice on behalf of commercial importers for import of
raw material, spare parts and machinery. Besides, SBP has also allowed banks to make payments on
behalf of commercial importers for imports of raw materials and spare parts on Open Account. In
addition, SBP has also enhanced the existing limit of 50% advance payment, allowed to
manufacturing concerns, for import of plant, machinery, spare parts and raw materials etc. against
letter of credit, to 100%. In December 2019, SBP allowed advance payment of up to 50% of the value
of imports against letter of credit to manufacturing concerns for import of plant, machinery, spare
parts and raw material etc.

After the implementation of a market based exchange rate system, the balance of payments has
witnessed significant improvement. In the first six months of the current fiscal year, the current
account deficit has contracted by 75 percent to USS 2.15 billion. This improvement is helping to
further relax some of the restrictions on imports by SBP. The latest measures, taken today, are in
continuation of facilitating export-oriented industries and manufacturing concerns in the backdrop of
ease of doing business and promoting exports’ growth. These measures will further contribute in
improving economic outlook of the country.

Monetary Policy Statement
May 20, 2019

Key developments since the last MPC statement

There have been three notable developments since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
meeting in March 2019. First, the government of Pakistan has reached a staff-level agreement with
the International Monetary Fund for 39-month long Extended Fund Facility of around US$ 6.0
billion. The program is designed to restore macroeconomic stability and support sustainable
economic growth, and is expected to unlock considerable additional external financing. Second,
trends in government borrowing reflect a widening fiscal deficit during the first nine months of
FY19 when compared to the same period in FY18. In addition, a greater reliance on central bank
financing of the deficit has acted to dilute the impact of previous monetary tightening, Finally, since
the last MPC, the exchange rate has depreciated by 5.93 percent to PKR 149.65 per USD, at the
close of 20th May 2019, reflecting a combination of underlying macroeconomic factors and market
sentiment considerations.

Real sector

SBP’s estimates show that economic growth is expected to slow in FY19 but rise modestly in FY20.
This slowdown is mostly due to lower growth in agriculture and industry. More than two-thirds of
real GDP growth in FY19 is expected to come from services. Going forward, some gradual recovery
in economic activity is expected on the back of improved market sentiment in the context of the
IMF supported program, a rebound in the agriculture sector and government incentives for export-
oriented industries.

External sector

The current account deficit narrowed to US$ 9.6 billion in Jul-Mar FY19 as compared to a deficit of
US$ 13.6 billion during the same period last year, a fall of 29 percent. The reduction is mainly driven
by import compression and a healthy growth in workers’ remittances. This impact was partially
offset by higher international oil prices. The non-oil trade deficit declined from US$ 13.7 billion in
Jul-Mar FY18 to US$ 11.0 billion in Jul-Mar FY19 reflecting the impact of stabilization policies
implemented so far. Recent indicators suggest export volumes have begun to grow although total
export receipts have not grown due unfavorable prices.

Despite the improvement in the current account and a noticeable increase in official bilateral
inflows, the financing of the current account deficit remained challenging. Consequently, reserves
declined to US$ 8.8 billion as of 10th May 2019 from US$ 10.5 billion at end-March 2019. The
exchange rate also came under pressure in the last few days. In SBP’s view, the recent movement in
the exchange rate reflects the continuing resolution of accumulated imbalances of the past and some
role of supply and demand factors. SBP will continue to closely monitor the situation and stands
ready to take measures, as needed, to address any unwarranted volatility in the foreign exchange
market. Furthermore, the current level of reserves is below standard adequacy levels (equal to three
months of imports cover). As noted in previous MPC statements, deep structural reforms ate

SBP welcomes Bank of China International CEO/Chairperson in Islamabad

“Closer Cooperation in the banking sector will assist in strengthening relationship further with
China. Number of mega projects which huge Chinese companies are implementing in Pakistan
necessitates smooth and efficient banking arrangements to meet the banking needs”, this was the
core message conveyed by the Acting Governor/Deputy Governor of State Bank of Pakistan Mr.
Saeed Ahmad in a meeting welcoming the Chief Executive Officer Ms Li Tong of Bank of China
International (BoCI). BoCI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of China.

BoCl is the investment banking unit of BoC. It is a huge bank with assets over US$ 2.26 trillion
and share capital of US$ 45 billion and presence in 42 countries. It has been a Fortune Global
500 entity for the last two decades

Ms. Li Tong headed a group of more than 20 businessmen including CEO’s of mega companies
to explore further cooperation between Pakistan and China in the field of energy, infrastructure
development, transport, manufacturing, mining and banking. In the meeting at SBP she was
accompanied with Ms. Cheng Yan MD & Vice Chairman, Mr. Michae Cheng and Mr. Wang Jia
and local representatives. Mr. Saeed Ahmad highlighted the close and very special relationship
which exists between Pakistan and China covering a number of important areas. The Pakistan-
China Economic Corridor and Joint Cooperation Committee are the hall mark of deepening
friendship. This was recently got strengthened by the visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to
China and Chinese Premier’s visit to Pakistan.

The visit by BoCI CEO/Chairperson to SBP in Islamabad was meant to discuss the possibility of
opening a branch of BoCI in Pakistan. Executive Director of State Bank, Muhammad Ashraf
Khan also attended and participated in the meeting. Ms. Tong appreciated the warm reception
extended to her by SBP and the brief given to her about the process and requirements of
establishing a foreign bank, a branch or a subsidiary in Pakistan.

SBP informed her about the close working relationship which exists between People Bank of
China (PBC) — the Central Bank and SBP and the Currency Swap Agreement which has been in
place between the two countries. Ms. Tong was apprised about Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) which has branches in Islamabad and Karachi and in the process of opening the
third branch in Lahore. The experience of ICBC in Pakistan has been good. Though there is no
Pakistani banks’ branch operating in China but negotiations are at advanced stage to establish a
branch of a leading Pakistani bank’s branch there in near future. Mr. Saeed Ahmad reminded
CEO of BoCI that currently Pakistan enjoys the privilege of being a member a group of the
countries which are allowed to participate in the local bond market in China. Also an MoU
signing ceremony in Beijing is scheduled to take place in the last week of October to establish
Asia International Infrastructure Bank for which Pakistan is one of the founding members. The
ceremony will be attended by Finance Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar at a special invitation of
Chinese authorities together with other senior officials from Ministry of Finance.

RS. 160 BILLION TARGET ALLOCATED TO
AGRICULTURE SECTOR FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006-07

The annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
which was held in Karachi today with Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar in the chair, has approved a target of Rs.160 billion for the
disbursement of agriculture credit to the farmers during the fiscal year 2006-07. This
target is 23 per cent higher than the last fiscal year’s target of Rs.130 billion.

She underscored that these targets should be treated as ‘minimum
achievements’ required from the banks. While the central bank is not in the business
of directed credit, but it would encourage banks to achieve balanced regional and
sectoral distribution of credit to achieve sound economic development.

The five big commercial banks (ABL, HBL, MCB, NBP and UBL) have been
allocated a target of Rs.80 billion, Zarai Tarqiati Bank Ltd Rs.48 billion, Punjab
Provincial Co-operative Bank Ltd. Rs.9 billion and Domestic Private Banks as a
group Rs.23 billion. The committee also made province wise allocations of
disbursements, based on the cropped area and absorption capacity of each province
and AJK and FATA.

The Committee expressed its deep satisfaction that the total disbursement to
the agriculture sector during July-May 2005-06 has reached to Rs.117 billion, which
is 25.8% higher than the disbursements of Rs.93.0 billion during the same period of
the last fiscal year. The disbursements made during the eleven months are about 90%
of the full year target and considering the average disbursements of Rs.15 billion in
the month of June during last three years, the full year target of Rs.130 billion would
be achieved comfortably.

The five big commercial banks as a group disbursed Rs.59.8 billion against the
full year target of Rs.63 billion. Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL), Punjab
Provincial Cooperative Bank Limited (PPCBL) and domestic private banks (DPBs)
disbursed Rs.38.8 billion, Rs.4.5 billion and Rs.13.9 billion against the target of Rs.43
billion, Rs.9 billion and Rs.15 billion respectively. The five big Commercial Banks as
a group achieved about 95% of the full year target. ZTBL 90%, PPCBL 50% and the
DPBs as a group achieved 92.4% of their annual targets.

The Committee was informed that the disbursements to farm and non-farm
sectors as a whole during the first eleven months of the fiscal year 06 remained more
or less as per target with farm sector fetching Rs.95.7 billion or 81.8% against the
target of 80% and non-farm sector obtaining Rs.19 billion or 16.3% against the target
of 16%. The Committee expressed the hope that the banks would take necessary steps
to further accelerate the pace of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector so that
target of Rs.160 billion for the year 2006-07 is achieved comfortably.

Private Sector Credit Disbursement

in line with long term trends and is likely to pick-up further in
second-half of FY08: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan said today the
disbursement of credit to the private sector has gained momentum significantly
in October-November, 2007 and is likely to pick up further in the second-half of
the current fiscal year 2007-08.

She made these observations while chairing the second meeting of the
Private Sector Credit Advisory Council held at State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this
morning. The meeting dwelt at length on recent trends and issues relating to
availability of credit to the private sector and discussed ways and means to
enhance credit disbursement to key sectors of the economy.

Dr Akhtar said the growth in private sector credit was broadly in line with
last two years’ comparable period growth, and expanded by Rs 103.1 billion in
the period from July 1, 2007 to November 24, 2007. Private sector credit growth
in FYO7-08 mainly reflects convergence to its long-term trend, relative to the
surge observed in FY05-06 due to several years of pent up demand and need
for investments in BMR by the industry.

The Governor stressed that in FYO7, the credit growth supported
effectively the growth in real economic activity. It is expected that private sector
credit disbursement this year will continue to support economic growth as SBP
has continued to efficiently managed liquidity.

“Private sector credit is expected to pick up in second half of FYO8 as
investors launch the pending projects and various IPP (Independent Power
Producers) projects are also in pipeline involving investment of around Rs100-120
billion,” the Governor added.

There was a general agreement that the private sector credit has been
impacted, among others by (i) banks adopting cautious lending stance given the
experience with loan defaults in some sectors; and (ii) mergers and acquisitions

State Bank Launches SMS Service for Issuance of Fresh Currency Notes

After receiving overwhelming response on Eid occasions in 2015, the State Bank of
Pakistan, through its subsidiary SBP Banking Services Corporation has re-launched the
SMS service for issuance of fresh currency notes to the general public.

The fresh notes will be available from nominated commercial bank branches called “e-
branches” and the sixteen offices of SBP BSC. The issuance to the general public through
Mobile SMS service by designated e-branches of commercial banks will commence from
2nd of Ramzan till 28th Ramzan. The service will be provided through 500 e-branches in
116 cities during Ramzan, 2016. Necessary stock of fresh banknotes has already been
placed with the designated e-branches. The charges for this services are Rs. 2/- plus tax,
per SMS.

Under the service, a person will send SMS message to short code 8877 comprising
his/her 13 digit CNIC/Smart Card number along with the desired e-branch ID [e.g.
3830305939875(space)KHI005]. Branch IDs of nominated branches are available on
sbp.org.pk, pakistanbanks.org and commercial banks’ websites.

In return, the person will receive an SMS containing his/her redemption code, e-branch
address and redemption code validity date. The redemption code will be valid for two

packets of Rs.10 and one packet of Rs.20. He/she may also avail one packet each of Rs. 50
and Rs. 100 as per availability of stock with the concerned e-branch. Under the SMS
service, each CNIC/Smart card number and mobile phone number can only be used
once. No transaction code will be issued to the sender in case he/she sends the same
CNIC/Smart card number from different mobile numbers or sends different
CNIC/Smart card numbers from same mobile number during the service. This will
however result in additional cost to the sender. In order to facilitate the general public for
their queries/complaints, SBP-BSC has established a help desk at 111-008-877 that can be

Monetary Policy Statement
March 24, 2020

1. At its last meeting on 17 March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted considerable
uncertainty about how the Coronavirus outbreak would impact the global economy and Pakistan. In the
statement issued following that meeting, the MPC “emphasized that it stood ready to take further actions if
and when needed as more information becomes available on the outlook for inflation and growth.”

2. Substantial new information on global and domestic developments has become available since the last
MPC meeting. Globally, the Coronavirus has severely increased in reach. This has caused major disruptions
to economic activity and the IMF has also significantly downgraded its global growth outlook for 2020 from
3.3 percent growth previously to below zero. These global developments have also led to a sharp fall in
international trade. On the domestic front, since the last MPC, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased
considerably, prompting social distancing and curtailment of activity. This is expected to lead to noticeable
slowdown in domestic demand.

3. The developments discussed above imply that the outlook for growth and inflation in Pakistan is likely to
be revised down further. In the wake of this new information, the MPC agreed at its emergency meeting
today, to take further action. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to cut the policy rate by a further 150 basis
points to 11 percent. This brings the cumulative easing over the past one week to 225 basis points. The MPC
was of the view that this cumulative easing would cushion the growth slowdown while protecting inflation

expectations.

4. ‘The MPC also noted that SBP is in the process of taking necessary regulatory measures in coordination
with banks to address pressures on cash flows of borrowers affected by Coronavirus related disruptions
through facilitating deferment and restructuring of their loans. The announcement of these measures is
expected soon and will complement the action being taken by the MPC on interest rates today.

5. The MPC remains ready to take whatever further actions become necessary in response to the evolving
economic impact of the Coronavirus.

President of Pakistan appreciates SBP for the leadership role in promoting
financial inclusion of women and digital payments

 

 

The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, has appreciated the Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr.
Reza Baqir, for leading the initiatives of SBP in the areas of women empowerment through financial
inclusion and expanding the landscape of digital payments in the country. He was addressing an online
meeting with Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir, SAPM on Poverty Alleviation and
Social Safety, Dr Sania Nishtar, senior SBP officials, Presidents/CEOs of banks and other stakeholders.
On Women Empowerment, Governor SBP gave a detailed briefing to the President about a number of
regulatory and financing measures to enhance the flow of financial services to women. He said that
SBP has been providing financing, under its subsidized Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for
Women Entrepreneurs, since 2017 to facilitate women owned startups and small scale businesses by
providing loans of up to Rs5 million. To particularly benefit the women of Balochistan encouraging
them to avail loans under this scheme, he apprised the President, that a quota of 20% has been
reserved for women entrepreneurs of Balochistan.

Adding further, Governor Baqir shared that SBP’s efforts are aligned with the Government’s priorities
of encouraging self-employment as, under the Prime Minister Kamyab Jawan Youth Entrepreneurship
Scheme, a quota of 25% has also been reserved for women. He remarked that SBP is collaborating with
Ehsaas program to implement the Prime Minister’s vision of having ‘One Woman One Account’ beyond
the existing facility of cash disbursements through branchless banking agents only. He also highlighted
the key features of SBP’s upcoming ‘Banking on Equality’ Policy, which would engender equality in
banking and reduce gender gap in financial inclusion.

On digital payments, the Governor SBP briefed the President on various initiatives to promote it in the
country. He elaborated SBP’s multipronged strategy including developing an interoperable and digital
payments infrastructure, providing enabling legal and regulatory environment, ensuring security of
digital payment channels and finally promoting and experimenting with new technologies and fintechs
companies. Sharing numbers on the progress of digital payments, Governor Baqir updated the
President that digital transactions in Pakistan have seen an upward trend in recent years. He
highlighted that, during FY20, 906 million transactions amounting to Rs66 trillion were processed
through retail e-Banking channels, whereas internet-banking channels processed 57 million
transactions amounting to Rs3 trillion. He added that a promising growth could also be witnessed in
mobile banking with 3 million new users added within one year and overall number of transactions of
83 million worth Rs2 trillion during FY20. Further, e-commerce transactions amounting to Rs35 billion
were conducted and bill payments worth Rs213 billion were made by consumers using digital payment
channels in Pakistan.

The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, thanked Governor for SBP’s efforts and progress on women
empowerment and promotion of digital payments. He also acknowledged the role of MPG in unlocking
the potential for economic benefits. He also appreciated the idea that the young female entrepreneurs
with large social media following may be identified as brand ambassadors to create awareness among
public about SBP policies and products for promoting gender financial inclusion.

SAPM, Dr. Sania Nishtar thanked SBP for its support on facilitation of Ehsaas beneficiaries through

Branchless Banking. She further added that they are working with SBP on use of micro payment
gateway for facilitating digital payments to Ehsaas beneficiaries.

Monetary Policy Statement
September 29, 2017

Macroeconomic environment remains conducive to growth without impacting headline
inflation. Favorable initial estimates of major crops, a healthy growth in credit to private sector
and growing productive imports all indicate solid gains in the real sector. On the back of
adequate food supplies and stable international commodity prices, headline inflation
decelerated in the first two months of FY18. The pursuit of higher economic growth however
poses growing challenges partly enunciated at the start of FY18. These include those arising
from pressures on the external front and an expansionary fiscal policy.

Expounding the real sector, full year LSM data indicates a healthy and broad-based growth of
5.7 percent for FY17 as compared to its earlier estimates of 4.9 percent. In fact, LSM for July 2017
posted a growth of 13.0 percent. Delving deeper into FY18, manufacturing activity is expected
to benefit from higher development spending, growing investments in CPEC-related projects,
improvement in security condition, and the continued trend of stable and low cost of
borrowing. Furthermore, an upbeat industrial outlook and a promising assessment of major
crops are going to have positive spillovers on the services sector. Based on current projections
of agriculture sector growth, GDP growth is likely to reach the annual target of 6.0 percent for
FY18 leading to an improved capacity to accommodate rising domestic demand.

Turning to inflation, average CPI inflation eased to 3.2 percent in Jul-Aug FY18 compared to 3.8
percent during the same period last year. With comfortable wheat and sugar stocks, no major
disruption is expected from supply side in the coming months of FY18. However, the core
inflation (non-food-non-energy), reflecting the underlying demand pressures in the economy,
continues to maintain its higher level of 5.6 percent in the initial two months of the fiscal year.
This is also visible from IBA-SBP’s Consumer Confidence Survey of September 2017, which
shows a modest rise in expected inflation during the next six months. Thus, with these demand
and supply side dynamics, average CPI inflation is expected to remain well below FY18 target
of 6.0 percent.

As depicted by core inflation, changes in monetary aggregates also indicate growing demand in
the economy. Although credit to private sector recorded a net seasonal retirement of Rs 80.6
billion during 1st July to 15t September FY18, its year-on-year growth has edged up to 21.1
percent on 15th September 2017- as compared to 7.7 percent on 16k September 2016, reflecting
an increase of Rs 892 billion during the year. Led by historic low interest rates on the one hand
and growing construction activity and consumer durables on the other, demand for credit
picked up. At the same time, healthy deposit growth has improved supply of loanable funds
with the banking sector and market rates remained stable. These favorable conditions at the
beginning of upcoming credit cycle bode well for healthy credit off take for yet another year.

The higher trajectory of economic growth has generated complementary external sector
pressures. The current account deficit for the first two months of FY18 has widened to US$ 2.6
billion. This is primarily driven by higher imports of productive goods, especially of machinery,
metal and petroleum products. The increase in import of these three groups was strong enough

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra - Governor SBP, unveils ‘Access to Finance (A2F) Survey 2015’
results

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has launched ‘Access to Finance (A2F) Survey 2015’ results
on Tuesday, 15th December 2015 at Karachi. Governor SBP, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra
while speaking at the launching ceremony said that A2F is part of the National Financial
Inclusion vision as it will serve dual purpose of gauging the impact of our financial inclusion
initiatives since 2008, and providing baseline data for the National Financial Inclusion
Strategy.

While addressing Presidents/CEOs of banks and key stakeholders, Mr. Wathra shared that
traditionally, one of the key challenges to access to finance has been the lack of demand side
information which is necessary for understanding the barriers to financial inclusion. Without
such information the market doesn’t have the insights and capacity to develop client centric
products and services. He hoped that the survey will help all the stakeholders in
understanding knowledge, attitude and practices of a common Pakistani when it comes to
managing financial matters.

On this occasion, Mr. André Oertel from M/s Horus Development Finance also made a
detailed presentation sharing the findings of the report.

SBP initiated the Access to Finance (A2F) Survey 2015 to assess the state of financial
access and usage in the country. This comprehensive country level study of more than
10,500 respondents was geared to measure and analyze the current and foreseeable
demand for financial services in Pakistan. The A2FS 2015 results show that access to
financial services has significantly increased in Pakistan since 2008, with 16% of the adult
population now having access to a bank account (including mobile wallets), improving from
11% in 2008. Moreover, 23% of the adult population has access to formal financial services
up from 12% in 2008. Furthermore, women have advanced remarkably in terms of financial
inclusion as now 11% of women are utilizing banking services, compared to only 4%
recorded in 2008.

This 2"" A2F Survey was carried out by M/s Horus Development Finance, International
consulting company together with local partner Gallup Pakistan.

The first Access to Finance (A2F) Study was conducted in 2008 which yielded a rich
database on all aspects of access to financial services and provided useful inputs for
analysis, planning and implementation of various initiatives and programs. The current and
previous survey results are available on A2F portal at www.A2FS2015.com.

Pak Rupee is in line with economic fundamentals

During the past couple of days the Pak Rupee has been once again facing speculative pressures due to
some recent newspaper articles criticizing external borrowing of government and the quality of
reserves of the country. These articles are highlighting just one aspect of the debt dynamics without
contextualizing it in Pakistan’s current performance and the overall macroeconomic stability.
Further, reference to reports by international rating agencies, such as Moody’s, is also being made
conveniently ignoring the strengths of the economy highlighted in the same report.

It would be pertinent to mention that the current level of exchange rate is broadly in line with the
economic fundamentals of the country. It is consistent with the improved external position of the
country, achieved through contained external current account deficit at low levels, continued surplus
in overall balance of payments of the country and built up of foreign exchange reserves to historic
high levels. SBP expects the external position to continue to strengthen and stands ready to take any
measure to ensure stability in the foreign exchange markets.

While referring to Moody’s reports, columnists have overlooked their recent assessment which noted
that “the support from multilateral and bilateral lenders bolster an improving foreign reserve position
and ongoing reform progress”. Moody’s have also mentioned that while Pakistan’s government
financing is mainly from domestic sources and system-wide external debt is declining as a percent to
GDP, the level of public debt poses a moderate degree of credit risk. It may be noted here that
Pakistan’s external debt obligation has actually decreased from 33 percent of GDP in FY10 to 23
percent at the end of FY15. Similarly, despite stagnant exports, the external debt to exports ratio has
declined from 300 percent in FY10 to 255 percent in FY15. Further, Moody’s have appreciated the
progress on structural reforms undertaken by Pakistan.

Borrowing externally is necessitated by trends in balance of payments in general and trade deficit in
particular. With shrinking of the current account deficit and with surplus in capital account, Pakistan’s
overall balance of payment position has contributed to the build-up of external buffers. State Bank of
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves is now over USD 15 billion at present, sufficient to cover four
months of imports, which is a marked improvement from 2013 when these were only USD 3.9 billion.
Apart from privatization proceeds, spot purchases from the interbank market amid falling oil prices
and rising workers’ remittances, Coalition Support Fund, and multilateral and bilateral inflows,
increase in foreign exchange reserves have also come from external borrowing, including that from
international capital markets.

SBP-BSC organizes workshop on agricultural finance

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan has
impressed upon all the stakeholders including the federal / provincial governments and the
banking industry to make concerted efforts to strengthen the agricultural sector due to its
critical importance in the country’s economy.

Inaugurating the Second Inter-Provincial Agricultural Workshop organized by SBP
Banking Services Corporation in Lahore today, Mr. Kamran highlighted the initiatives taken the
SBP/SBP-BSC to ensure adequate flow of funds to the agriculture sector. He said that some of
the major initiatives include regular review of policy and regulatory environment, bringing all
the banks to serve the rural communities, arranging awareness & information dissemination
programs, building capacity of banks, conducting research and surveys to further explore the
dynamics of rural economy for the benefit of bankers, and establishing regional agri-finance
focus groups in all SBP-BSC offices across the country.

Speaking on the occasion, senior officials of SBP & SBP-BSC including Directors of
Development Finance Support Department and Agricultural Credit Department explained in
detail the status and distribution patterns of agriculture credit and the policies and operational
strategies being undertaken to facilitate flow of credit to the agriculture sector. They also
elaborated efforts of SBP & SBP-BSC efforts for creating awareness, building banks’ capacity,
information dissemination programs, and the implementation of One Window Operation under
Sindh Pilot Project. The cooperation of the Revenue department in the implementation of One
Window Operation was also appreciated.

Following decisions were taken at the workshop:

e SBP-BSC would further strengthen its awareness campaign and would organize Agri
Melas/seminars in collaboration with banks and relevant provincial government
departments in different towns;

e SBP would further enhance its capacity building efforts so that banks are able to serve
the rural community in a more professional manner;

e From this year onward regional targets for growth in Agricultural credit would be given
to banks to minimize regional disparities in flow of Agricultural credit;

e SBP would conduct more research studies and surveys of different regions to enhance
stakeholders understanding of the rural economies in various regions;

e The Revenue Departments would take further steps to ensure expeditious issuance of
passbooks to the farming community and for completion of the land record automation
project.

e Appreciating the effectiveness of the forum it was decided to organize the workshop

SBP announces new regulatory incentives to promote
low cost and affordable housing finance

 

 

State Bank of Pakistan is constantly providing enabling regulatory environment to promote housing and
construction finance. This is an important sector that has significant economic linkages with other sectors
in the economy and the current level of credit provision in this sector is at a very low level of less than 1
percent of GDP which is much lower than in other similar countries and in the region. To support the
provision of finance to this sector and especially facilitate affordable housing, SBP has now announced five
regulatory relaxations to incentivize banks for financing low cost and affordable housing. Firstly, the
definition of low cost housing finance used in the current regulations for banks has been aligned with
definition used under Government Markup Subsidy Facility for Housing Finance eligible under Tiers | & Il of
housing finance. Specifically, in the SBP regulations, the value of housing unit has been increased from Rs
3 million to Rs 3.5 million with maximum loan size increased from Rs 2.7 million to Rs 3.15 million.
Consequently, the incentive for low cost housing finance will increase for banks as they will not only be able
to enjoy markup subsidy facility by the Government but the regulatory incentives under low cost housing
finance by SBP as well.

Current regulations and banking practices require banks to obtain documentary evidence of income.
Provision of this information is difficult for people generating income from informal sources which are
generally in low income segments. In order to facilitate financing for this segment, State Bank is urging the
banks to use alternate methods to identify income sources and assess the credit worthiness of the borrower.
The 24 and 3 type of relaxations are being given to facilitate financing for this segment. Accordingly, under
2"" relaxation, banks have been exempted from the requirement of using ‘verifiable income’ for the purpose
of calculating Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) in case of low cost housing finance where banks are using income
proxies and where income of borrower is not verifiable. Resultantly, borrowers with ‘non-verifiable income,’
estimated by banks using income proxies, will also become eligible to avail low cost housing finance.

Thirdly, banks have also been exempted from the requirement of observing DBR, in case of low cost housing
finance, where banks are using repayment surrogates like rent, utility bills, telcos bills, etc. to assess
repayment capacity of borrower. Hence, borrowers without verifiable or non-verifiable income will become
eligible to avail low cost housing finance.

Fourthly, banks have been exempted from the requirement of Internal Credit Risk Rating System for the low
cost housing finance till September 30, 2022 as their current systems do not specifically cater for low cost
housing finance. Accordingly, borrowers of low cost housing finance who cannot avail financing due to banks
internal credit rating criteria will now become eligible if the bank is otherwise satisfied. This time barred
relaxation will provide banks to develop their Internal Credit Risk Rating Systems for low cost housing
finance.

Finally, in order to provide comfort to the borrowers who have liquid securities or already have a housing
unit, banks have been allowed to extend housing finance for purchase/construction of a residential property
by accepting existing residential property or liquid securities in lieu of equity contribution for housing
finance at the time of calculations of Loan to Value ratio. Financing bank will create its lien on existing
residential property/liquid securities in addition to mortgage of residential property being financed.

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
November 23, 2020

1. At its meeting on 23 November 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the
policy rate at 7 percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in September, the domestic recovery has
gradually gained traction, in line with expectations for growth of slightly above 2 percent in FY21, and

business sentiment has improved further. Nevertheless, there are risks to the outlook. The recent rise in
Covid cases in Pakistan and many other countties presents considerable downside risks. On the upside, while
it could take some time to fully implement worldwide, there has been recent encouraging news on vaccine
development. On the inflation front, recent out-turns have been on the higher side, primarily due to increases
in food prices. However, these supply-side pressures are likely to be temporary and average inflation is
expected to fall within the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for FY21. Taken together, risks to the
outlook for both growth and inflation appear balanced.

2. Given the broadly unchanged outlook for growth and inflation, the MPC viewed the existing stance o
monetaty policy as appropriate to support the nascent recovery while keeping inflation expectations well-

 

anchored and maintaining financial stability. The MPC noted that the lagged effects of the significant fiscal
monetary and credit stimulus injected during the pandemic should continue to shore up growth in coming
quarters.

3. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Real sector

4. Recent data suggest a further strengthening and broadening of the recovery observed since July, led by
construction and manufacturing. Sales of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) rebounded in FY21 Q1,
average sales volumes of POL and automobiles have surpassed their pre-Covid levels of FY20, and cement
sales are at an all-time high. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) continues to rebound, expanding by 4.8 percent
(y/y) in FY21 Q1, against a contraction of 5.5 percent in the same quarter last year. Nine out of fifteen major
manufacturing sectors have shown gains, including textiles, food and beverages, petroleum products, paper
and board, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, cement, fertilizer, and rubber products. The MPC noted that the
recovery was being supported by stimulus provided by the government, the round of policy rate cuts and the
SBP’s timely measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID pandemic. These measures included principal
extension and loan restructuring, payroll financing, and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF)
which injected liquidity, reduced layoffs and provided incentives for investment. In agriculture, the impact of
the expected decline in cotton production is likely to be offset by growth in other major crops and higher
wheat production due to the rise in support prices and recently announced subsidies on fertilizers and
pesticides. While social distancing continues to weigh more heavily on certain parts of the services sector,
wholesale and retail trade and transportation are expected to benefit from the knock-on impacts of the on-
going pick-up in construction, manufacturing and agriculture.

State Bank issues updated version of Foreign Exchange Manual-2017

In order to facilitate the stakeholders including Authorized Dealers (Banks), exporters, importers, travel
agents, carriers, etc. the State Bank of Pakistan keeps on issuing updated Foreign Exchange Manual from
time to time. Last such version of the Manual was issued in May, 2016.

Since issuance of the updated Foreign Exchange Manual in 2016, several changes/amendments in the
foreign exchange regulations have been made. Although the FE Circulars, Circular Letters, Notifications,
etc. through which these changes/amendments were made have been posted at the State Bank’s
website, the same have been incorporated in the Foreign Exchange Manual so that the stakeholders can
find the regulations/instructions in consolidated form in a single document.

Accordingly, the Foreign Exchange Manual-2017 stands updated upto April 30, 2017 and has been
placed at the State Bank’s website for reference of the stakeholders. The State Bank expects that the
use of updated Manual by the stakeholders would enable them to comply with the existing rules and
regulations governing foreign exchange business.

SBP simplifies instructions and procedure regarding remittances for medical
treatment and studies abroad

In order to facilitate resident Pakistanis to meet their individual foreign exchange needs, State Bank
of Pakistan vide FE Circular No. 08 of 2015 has simplified its instructions/procedure regarding

remittances/release of foreign exchange related to medical treatment and studies abroad.

As per revised instructions related to medical treatment abroad, banks have been allowed to remit
foreign exchange up to USS 50,000/- or equivalent in other foreign currencies to foreign hospitals on
account of medical treatment of resident Pakistanis on the recommendation of concerned medical
specialist/hospital in Pakistan. In addition, banks have also been allowed to release cash foreign
exchange equivalent to USS 5,000/- each to the patient and attendant to meet their cash foreign
exchange needs. Previously, the patient had to undergo a cumbersome and time consuming process
of getting recommendations from the medical board constituted by the Government and obtaining

prior approval from the State Bank of Pakistan in each case.

As regards simplification of instructions related to studies abroad, banks may remit foreign exchange
to foreign educational institutions on behalf of students desirous of studying in foreign institutions up
to USS 70,000/- or equivalent per student per calendar year as per the criteria set out in the circular.
Banks have further been allowed to release cash foreign exchange to the students equivalent to USS
5,000/- for meeting their initial living expenses. The previous instructions involved complicated
process and required excessive documentation and details before making remittances on above

account and the students had to arrange cash foreign exchange themselves.

In case of foreign exchange requirements for medical treatment and studies abroad in excess of the
limits set out in the circular, the concerned bank may forward the case to the Director, Foreign

Exchange Operations Department, SBP-BSC, Head Office, Karachi for consideration.

Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reform emphasizes close
collaboration amongst institutions for economic progress of the country

Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Prof. Ahsan Iqbal has said that all
institutions of the country should work hard for making Pakistan amongst top 25 economies of the
world by 2025. He was presiding over a meeting with Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf
Mahmood Wathra of the senior management of Planning Commission and SBP in Karachi.

Expressing his thoughts, Mr. Iqbal said,” Making Pakistan amongst top 25 economies of the world by
2025 requires very concerted and coordinated efforts by those stakeholders who are involved in
economic management of the country,” adding,”We have not been able to realize our true potential
in many areas including industry, export, agriculture and human resource due to lack of shared
vision.”He said Pakistan is now well poised to growth and it is important that all relevant institutions
work as a team in order to understand future challenges and opportunities.

Extolling the role played by State Bank of Pakistan, the minister said that State Bank is one of
Pakistan’s success stories and one of the major institutions involved in the economic management of
the country.”SBP has wealth of experience and knowledge and Planning Commission intends to
collaborate with SBP in order to arrive at shared understanding and knowledge for future of country’s
economy,” said the minister.

Welcoming the minister Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra said State Bank is always
forthcoming in addressing economic challenges of the country. The Governor stated that the initiative
for engagement of SBP and Planning Commission on various economic issues to share expertise and
knowledge on different subjects is a step in the right direction. He assured the minister that SBP will
work closely with Planning Commission for evolving a roadmap for economic progress of the country.

Later on, senior officials of SBP gave a detailed presentation on adoption of flexible inflation targeting
regime; challenges and potential strategies to boost country’s exports and initiatives taken for
strengthening of agriculture sector.

The minister was apprised that with a view to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, SBP
plans to introduce a flexible inflation targeting framework as its monetary policy regime. By
introducing an explicit range of inflation target, it would be easier for household and businesses to
understand economic conditions and form future expectations accordingly. Moreover, the strategy
would allow SBP to balance the need for price stability with economic growth.

The presentation also delineated upon export sector of the country that could not get enough
significance, hither to. Most FDI that has come into the country was to cater to the domestic market
(like power and automobile sectors) and not exports. Firms did not invest in Research &Development
and Technology and also ignored the significance of branding. Also, manufacturers concentrated in a
few traditional products and did not diversify and move-up the value chain. Underdeveloped human
capital, lack of standardization of products due to small scale companies and almost no investment in
the past to establish domestic processing facilities (like tool and die manufacturing) are the key
challenges for export sector.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 25, 2017

The inflation expectations in the current fiscal year continue to remain well anchored. This has been
largely due to the near-absence of any major supply side pressures. However, rising real incomes in a
low interest rate environment since FY14 are indicating signs of pick up in domestic demand, which is
broadly reflected in the core inflation measures. Going forward, improving consumer confidence, as
depicted by IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey of March 2017, indicates further increase in
consumer demand. Hence, barring any major cost shocks, domestic demand will define the underlying
trend of headline inflation in FY18.

The real economic activity continues to gather pace at the back of better agricultural output, increase in
key Large-scale Manufacturing sectors, and a healthy uptick in the credit to private sector. This
expansion is helped by a range of factors including low cost of inputs, upbeat economic sentiments,
improved energy supplies, and CPEC related investments. As a result, GDP growth is expected to
further improve in FY17.

Also, prudent monetary policy stance has translated well into low and stable market interest rates,
which incentivized private sector to borrow from commercial banks to finance their businesses and
investment activities. Accordingly, private sector credit increased by Rs 349 billion during Jul-Feb FY17
as compared to Rs 267 billion in the same period last year. Encouragingly, fixed investment category
led the rise in private sector businesses loans by posting Rs 159 billion uptick during this period,
compared to Rs 102 billion last year. Similarly, consumer financing continued the uptrend in the first
eight months of the current fiscal year. Improved interbank liquidity conditions also spurred the
growth in private sector credit. This was led by both net government retirement to commercial banks
and a decent increase in bank deposits compared to the withdrawals seen last year. Furthermore,
interbank liquidity was managed well with calibrated open market operations that kept the weighted
average overnight repo rate close to the policy rate.

The expansion in economic activity has also translated into significant increase in imports, which along
with lack of any sustained improvement in exports and a small decline in remittances has pushed the
current account deficit to US$ 5.5 billion during Jul-Feb FY17. While net financial flows remained
higher, these were not sufficient to finance the current account deficit.

However, accounting for positive impact of the recent policy measures to augment exports and check
non-essential imports, the current account deficit may be contained in the coming months. Also,
continuation of the financial inflows, CPEC related imports, and any major fluctuation in the global oil
price will determine the overall position of the external sector in FY18.

Keeping these factors in perspective, the Monetary Policy Committee of SBP has decided to keep the
policy rate unchanged at 5.75 percent.

Governor SBP Urges Banks to Address Geographical And Sectoral Imbalances for achieving
Rs 1 Trillion agri-credit target for FY 2017-18

The Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) meeting was held in Quetta, under the
chairmanship of Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Tariq Bajwa. The meeting was attended
by senior officers of SBP, presidents and executives of commercial banks, specialized banks,
microfinance banks & Islamic banks, representatives from federal & provincial governments, and
chamber of agriculture/ farmers associations.

Mr. Bajwa, while congratulating the ACAC members on surpassing the Rs 700 billion targets for the
fiscal year 20161-7, stressed upon four key areas requiring special attention of all stakeholders which
included (a) Strategizing the achievement of Rs. 1 trillion disbursement target; (b) Increasing financial
inclusion of smallholder farmers to address their credit needs, particularly for production loans; (c)
Rationalizing the markup rates on agricultural financing to pass on the benefit of historically low
discount rate and (d) Increasing bank’s footprint in underserved regions and provinces for reducing
regional disparities.

While delivering his keynote address, Mr. Bajwa emphasized that in order to successfully harness
untapped potential of agricultural, it is necessary to meet the credit demand. He highlighted critical
challenges confronted by the industry including provision of finance to small and marginalized
farmers, addressing geographical and sectoral imbalances and financing to non-crop activities need to
be addressed. In particular, financial institutions need to come up with new ideas and products for
spreading their outreach to remote and underserved areas like Balochistan. He also stated that there
is a huge scope and demand for Shariah compliant agri. financing products and recommended Islamic
banks to increase their focus on Islamic agri financing.

The Governor highlighted the active role played by the Central Bank for promoting agri. finance in the
country. He shared the SBP’s multifaceted approach to sensitize banks to adopt agricultural financing
as a viable business line. He informed the audience that due to joint efforts by SBP and the industry
for broadening access to finance in the country, formal credit disbursement by financial institutions
has increased to Rs 704.5 billion in FY 16-17 from Rs 391.4 billion in FY 12-13, showing a steep
increase of more than 80 percent in 4 years.

The key note address was followed by a presentation wherein the performance of banks on key
indicators relevant to agricultural financing was reviewed. The participants deliberated on the way
forward for credit enhancement in the underserved provinces/regions especially Balochistan.

Yaseen Anwar stresses the need for the development of robust
Shariah compliant risk management infrastructure in Pakistan

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed the need for
the development of a robust Shariah compliant risk management infrastructure in Pakistan’s
Islamic banking industry that will enable both the Islamic banks and their clients to mitigate
genuine business risks.

Inaugurating a workshop on ‘Hedging in Islamic Finance and Master Hedging
Agreement,’ which was organized by International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM) in
collaboration with the State Bank of Pakistan in Karachi today, Mr. Anwar said that while
conventional banks have access to a variety of sophisticated risk management and hedging
instruments, there has been a dearth of Shariah compliant hedging products in the country for
mitigating risks arising out of genuine business transactions that put Islamic Banking Institutions
(IBIs) at a disadvantageous position viz a viz their conventional counterparts.

Describing the pace of growth and development of the Islamic banking industry in
Pakistan as encouraging, he said that at present it constitutes over 7 percent of the country’s
banking system. Given the healthy growth for the past several years, the enabling regulatory
and Shariah compliance framework, the growing HR capacity of IBIs and increasing awareness
of the masses about Islamic banking, the share of the industry is likely to increase manifold in
the future, he added.

Mr. Anwar, however, observed that despite these positive developments and trends, we
need not be complacent as the industry still faces numerous challenges, including development
of a robust Shariah compliant risk management infrastructure. ‘Moreover, the absence of
standardized documentation invariably results in significantly higher transaction costs thus
making the transaction unviable,’ he added.

SBP Deputy Governor noted that notwithstanding the dire need of Shariah compliant
risk management and hedging instruments for Islamic banks, it should be explicitly understood
that such instruments should cover/hedge the genuine risks arising due to real business and
economic transactions and should in no way allow transactions for speculative motives. ‘I
presume, the same is the spirit of the Tahawwut (Hedging) Master Agreement (TMA). This
workshop, | believe, will enable our Islamic banking industry to better understand the
objectives, the underlying transactions and legal documentation etc suggested in the TMA,’ he
said, adding that it will also enable our market to develop and offer Shariah compliant hedging
instruments.

Banks urged to adopt effective tools
for galvanizing home remittances

Dr Farooq Sattar, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis, today urged upon
commercial banks and other stakeholders to adopt various cost-effective and technologically
advanced delivery channels that would help achieve two-fold increase in the quantum of
home remittances within a year.

During a meeting, which was jointly chaired by Dr Sattar and Syed Salim Raza, Governor,
State Bank of Pakistan, held at SBP Karachi, the Minister for Overseas Pakistanis said effective
delivery channels would help in incremental growth of home remittances. “It may be an
ambitious target but not an impossible one,” Dr Sattar added. He hoped that every
stakeholder will work in a coordinated manner to achieve the goal.

The meeting discussed in detail issues related to transmission of funds from overseas
Pakistanis to their families back home. Both Mr Raza and Dr Sattar underscored the need to
facilitate remitters so they could be encouraged to use official channels for transmission of
remittances as movement of funds through informal channels represents both a loss of
revenue and a welfare loss for remitters who are forced to send money home via
undocumented channels.

Mr Raza said that the State Bank would take the initiative in consultation with the
Ministry for Overseas Pakistani and other stakeholders in developing a mechanism to enhance
flow of inward remittances and for better investment prospects. He said that special emphasis
will be given to reduction in cost of sending remittances and delivery time involved, which are
some of the major hurdles in mobilizing remittances through formal channels.

The participants of the meeting were given a brief presentation by the State Bank on
recent international efforts and practices being followed by banks in various developing
countries to facilitate the flow of remittances. Heads of various commercial banks and other
stakeholder apprised the meeting about their initiatives and the products they are offering to
their customers.

The meeting was attended, among others, by heads of commercial banks,
representatives from NADRA, Central Directorate of National Savings and other stakeholders,
besides senior officials of the State Bank and Ministry for Overseas Pakistanis.

Broad based and robust growth witnessed in advances
to private sector, says QPR of the Banking Sector

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 30th
June, 2017, has been released by SBP today. As highlighted by the report, the key
development of the quarter is broad based and robust growth in advances to private sector
which is also the prime reason behind 8.3 percent growth in the asset base.

The gross advances (domestic) to private sector have increased by 6.1 percent in comparison
to 4.0 percent growth recorded in the corresponding period of last year. Besides seasonal
financing need for commodity procurement, the financing demand has come from various
sectors including chemical/pharmaceutical, production and transmission of energy,
agribusiness, food and allied products, construction, transport, storage etc. Moreover, the
continued growth in auto financing has pushed consumer financing up. The surge in
advances may be attributed to enabling macroeconomic conditions such as monetary easing
which has lowered the cost of borrowing and positive feedback from the real economy —
particularly the consistent activity in large scale manufacturing.

The asset quality of the banking sector has improved further as Gross Non Performing Loans
(NPLs) ratio has moved down to 9.3 percent as of end June 2017 from 9.9 percent as of end
March 2017 (and 11.1 percent as of end June, 2016).

Investments have increased by 5.6 percent and Government papers remain the prime
attraction. There is a change in investment pattern, though, as banks have mostly invested in
short-term MTBs. Continuous rise in investment in Government securities has further
strengthened the already comfortable liquidity position of the banking system.

The deposit base of the banking sector has moved up by 6.5 percent, slightly lesser than 6.8
percent in Q2CY16. The deceleration in deposit growth is mainly caused by dip in financial
institutions’ deposit — which are transitory in nature. On the other hand, the customer
deposits — relatively more stable funding source and comprising 96.5 percent share in overall
deposit base — has surged by 7.7 percent; higher than 6.0 percent during the corresponding
period last year.

Banking sector has earned profit (before tax) of PKR 150.4 billion with strong ROA of 1.8
percent and ROE of 21.9 percent. Encouragingly, interest earnings (Year-to-date) have
increased by 1.0 percent in Q2CY17 (against 8.6 percent decline during the same period last
year) on account of income on advances.

Agricultural credit target achievements in FY 2018-19

Banks made disbursements of Rs 1,174 billion or 94% against the ambitious target of Rs 1,250 billion
set by Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee for 2018-19. The achievement of agri. credit
disbursement is a sizable performance in agri. lending despite number of demand and supply side
challenges. The current year’s disbursement is 21% higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs
972.6 billion. Further, the agri. outstanding portfolio increased to Rs 562.4 billion on end June, 2019
registering a growth of 20% compared with the last year’s position of Rs 469.4 billion. Similarly, the
agricultural credit outreach has increased to 4.01 million farmers or 91% against target of 4.42 million
farmers at end June 2019, recording growth of 8% from 3.72 million farmers at end June 2018.

To achieve these numbers, SBP adopted a multifaceted strategy and made concerted efforts for
pursuing a massive agricultural credit target which included; sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing
as a viable business line, exploring new avenues of financing, value chain financing, mobilizing e-credit,
warehousing receipt financing, implementation of crop/livestock insurance and credit guarantee
schemes for the farmers etc.

The achievement could be made due to the integrated efforts of federal/provincial governments, SBP,
financial institutions and other stakeholders. Further, the efforts included rigorous follow up with the
top management of banks and agri. credit heads and conducting regular follow-up meetings with
regional management were instrumental for target monitoring. Conducting regular farmers’ awareness
& financial literacy programs across the country, initiation of one window operation in KPK and holding
job fairs for agri. graduates in underserved provinces were also helpful. Moreover, the support of SBP
BSC field offices in monitoring the district/regional targets was also supportive.

The detailed credit performance reveals that during FY 2018-19, five major commercial banks
collectively disbursed agri. loans of Rs 653.5 billion or 100.4% of their annual target of Rs 651 billion,
specialized banks disbursed Rs 81.2 billion or 71.8% of their annual target of Rs 113 billion and fifteen
domestic private banks as a group achieved 86.5% by disbursing Rs 211.9 billion against their target of
Rs 245 during FY-2018-19.

Moreover, Microfinance Banks (MFBs) as a group have achieved 98.7% by disbursing agri. loans of Rs.
154.0 billion to small farmers which is 23% higher than the disbursement of Rs 124.8 billion during
same period last year. Similarly, the Microfinance Institutions/Rural Support Programs collectively
achieved 97.1% of their targets by disbursing Rs 34.0 billion to small and marginalized farmers during
FY 2018-19.

Five Islamic Banks as a group achieved 78.8% of their annual target of Rs 50.0 billion by disbursing Rs
39.4 billion which is Rs 23 billion higher than the disbursement made during the corresponding period
last year. Further, in order to mobilize the Islamic Windows of commercial banks for agricultural
financing, the disbursement targets of Rs 50.0 billion were assigned for 2018-19. Accordingly, the
windows of commercial banks as a group disbursed Rs 32.7 billion or 65.4% of the annual targets to
faith sensitive clients during FY 2018-19.

National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y) launches its eLearning
Portal

State Bank of Pakistan in collaboration with National Institute of Banking & Finance (NIBAF) is
implementing National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y) to impart essential financial
education to Pakistani youth and school going children for strengthening of their money management
skills and enhance their understanding of financial matters.

National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y) launches Pakistan’s first online financial literacy
course which is delivered through an engaging and interactive game. The game targets three age-
groups — Children (9-12), Adolescents’ (13-17), and Youth (18-29) and can be accessed through your
desktop browser or through a dedicated mobile phone application.

NFLP-Y’s easy-to-use eLearning portal and mobile app delivers its lessons in English and Urdu language
through a story-based game format designed to help understand and apply principles of financial
literacy. Users follow the story of two entrepreneurial families as they tackle personal, financial, and
business decisions. As the player of this game, the aim is to help the families create a successful
business. In just a couple of hours, users can master the essentials of saving, budgeting, borrowing, and
banking, among many other topics. Interactive questions follow each topic to assess the knowledge of
the students. Those users who complete the course are awarded with a Certificate of Financial Literacy.

The game is called ‘POMPAK - Learn to Earn’. It’s free, ready to be used and available at the below
addresses:

Google Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.knowledgeplatform.pompak&hl=en

Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pompak-learn-to-earn/id1503676474?ls=1

Laptop/Desktop (Web Version): https://nflpy.pk/elearning/

When closure of educational institutes in Pakistan is affecting studies of thousands of students, NFLP-
Y is hoping to positively impact the youth of Pakistan with its eLearning portal. Anyone aged between
9-29 years old can download the game or use the web portal to gain the much needed financial literacy
training which will help them take control of their financial matters.

SBP denies news item regarding 18 undeclared bank accounts

State Bank of Pakistan categorically denies a news item published in a leading English
language newspaper relating to the undeclared 18 bank accounts of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf
(PTI) to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

SBP neither maintains the database of banks’ individual accountholders nor possesses any
related information / record thereof. Banks being the custodian of customers’ information
may directly provide this information to various agencies, on case-to-case basis, as per
procedure laid down under the respective laws. Therefore, it is out of question that SBP has
reported 18 undeclared bank accounts of PTI out of total 26 to the ECP as reported by a
English language newspaper.

In fact, during July 2018 ECP approached SBP for assistance to obtain the bank accounts
related information of PTI from 2009 to 2013 as per Commission’s mandate enshrined in the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Election Act, 2017. SBP while discharging
of its duties advised all banks to provide the required information / data directly to ECP by
due date, as per procedure laid down under the law.

Pakistan launches ‘Universal Financial Access Initiative’
to accelerate financial inclusion

State Bank of Pakistan, together with the World Bank and the United Nations launched the “Universal
Financial Access Initiative”, today. The event was held to secure public and private sector
commitments to achieve universal financial inclusion in Pakistan as envisaged under the National
Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS).

The event was graced by Her Majesty Queen Maxima of Netherlands who is also UN Secretary-
General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA), President World Bank
Group Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the Federal Finance Minister, Senator Mr. Muhammad Ishaq Dar, and
Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra.

Queen Maxima, while appreciating the efforts of Pakistan for improving financial inclusion remarked,
“Today, Pakistan’s commitment to financial inclusion moves to a new level of action guided by the
recently adopted National Financial Inclusion Strategy, supported by government and private-sector
commitments, and with the backing of the World Bank Group, Pakistan is prepared to take flight.”
She added further that “thanks to the committed work of many, Pakistan has built one of the
strongest foundations for financial inclusion in the world. New regulations have supported the
emergence of branchless banking, a growing microfinance sector, effective payments systems and a
more constructive approach to customer identification.

Speaking on the occasion the Finance Minister said, “Government’s development policy agenda is
based on the principle of inclusive economic growth so that the benefits are shared across all
segments of the society.” He termed Financial Inclusion as a critical enabler for achieving inclusive
economic growth.

In his welcoming address, while highlighting the efforts of SBP, Governor Ashraf Mahmood Wathra
shared that access to financial services has improved from 12% of population in 2008 to 23% in 2015.
He said, “Universal Financial Access initiative, under the umbrella of the UN, the World Bank and the
Government, will accelerate this pace and serve as a catalyst for improving socio-economic conditions
and poverty alleviation.”

The Chairman of Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) Muhammad Aftab Manzoor on behalf of banking
and microfinance sector pledged full support in reaching out to public and achieving targets set under
the NFIS. PBA pledged to increase access to M-wallet accounts to 50 % of the adults including 25% of
female population and increasing other financial services to micro and small businesses by 2020. In
addition, he pledged that banking sector will partner with SBP to enhance financial awareness and
literacy under CSR initiatives.

Banks to electronically submit foreign exchange related cases through SBP Online Portal

Two core departments of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) related to forex operations i.e. Exchange Policy
Department (EPD) & Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD) have recently arranged series
of detailed presentation on foreign exchange operations and ‘SBP Online Portal’. After its formal
launch this month, banks will electronically submit foreign exchange related cases to SBP.

During the presentation, the stakeholders were given an overview about working of the online
portal.

In order to keep the clients apprised about the status of cases submitted to SBP, an email containing
system-generated unique case number will be sent to the clients on the email address provided by
banks at the time of case submission. Furthermore, the updated position of their case can also be
accessed on SBP website through unique case number assigned to each case.

Managing Director, SBP Banking Services Corporation (BSC), Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan in his
welcome address underlined the importance and key role of business sector in economic revival &
future growth of the country. He also highlighted the key initiatives taken by SBP to digitalize the
processes and move towards paperless environment, which will ultimately benefit the businesses of
the country. Director, EPD informed the participants about recent policy measures taken by SBP to
promote the business sentiments in the country. He explained that current measures are in
continuation of SBP’s efforts to ease the earlier restrictions as well as to facilitate and support ease of
doing business in view of the improved economic outlook.

It may be mentioned here that in order to create awareness among the business community about
the foreign exchange operations and to apprise them about the key developments at State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) related to digitalization and ease of doing business, awareness sessions were
conducted by SBP at Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala & Sialkot. The subject sessions were attended by
more than 150 officials from different companies nominated by various chambers and associations
including Pakistan Business Council, Overseas Chamber of Commerce & Industry and local chamber of
commerce & industry of respective cities.

The presentation was followed by interactive question and answer sessions. Participants raised
queries related to various aspects of foreign exchange operations including exchange rate stability,
SBP’s guidelines regarding trade based money laundering (TBML) and government subsidy schemes
for exporter, which were answered by the SBP management. At the conclusion of the session,
Managing Director, SBP BSC thanked the participants for their concrete and specific suggestions
which would help further improve the ‘SBP Online Portal’.

Previously, an awareness session was also conducted in Karachi. Furthermore, similar sessions have
also been planned for other cities in coming weeks.

announced a number of regulatory relief measures for the financial sector and real economy. These
measures are primarily aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of banking sector while enhancing
their lending capacity to support the economic activities in the country.

The banks/DFls in Pakistan have much higher capital levels than prescribed globally or minimum levels
advised by the State Bank of Pakistan. Accordingly, SBP sees no immediate signs of systemic capital
fragility across the banking industry. However, banks/DFls have been advised to suspend the dividend
distribution for the next two quarters. The banks/DFls that have approved dividend declaration for
quarter ended March 2020 by 22"" April 2020 have been advised to suspend dividend distribution for
June and September quarters 2020. All other banks have been advised to suspend dividend distribution
for March and June 2020 quarters. This important decision has been taken keeping in view uncertainty
arising out of COVID 19 pandemic and probability of higher infections in loan portfolios of banks as a
result of that. This measure will also enhance loss absorption capacity of the banking system and will
enable them to further support the real sector in Pakistan.

Notably, while releasing prescribed capital buffers and taking other regulatory relief measures, a
number of other jurisdictions across the globe have also placed moratorium on dividend distribution
and payment of cash bonuses to senior/executive officers and material risk takers.

We are confident that the suspension of dividend payout will further increase the resilience of banking
sector and improve their ability to provide much needed credit support to the real economy. SBP will
keep on closely monitoring the performance of banks/DFls under its regulatory domain and take
appropriate action as needed to ensure safety and soundness of individual banks/DFls and the overall
banking system.

Press Release

State Bank of Pakistan Organizes International Conference on

“Affordable Housing & Mortgage Finance”

A two-day International Conference on Affordable Housing & Mortgage Finance organized
by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was inaugurated today in Islamabad. The Conference aims to
discuss innovative strategies and solutions to increase outreach of housing finance to low and
middle income groups.

At the beginning of the conference a message from the Prime Minister, Mian Muhammed
Nawaz Sharif, was read by the Deputy Governor, Saeed Ahmed. The Prime Minister said,
‘Pakistan is currently confronting a massive challenge of housing backlog of around 9 million
units, out of which, a large part pertains to the economically disadvantage families and
members of the lower middle class. This, coupled with a weak governance regime of urban
civic institutions, has resulted in the mushroom growth of katchi abadies and slums / squatter
settlements in major metropolitan areas.

In line with the manifesto of PML(N), our Government is fully committed to resolve the issue
of housing shortage in the country particularly for the low income groups. It has announced a
comprehensive housing finance scheme which includes construction of 1000 clusters of 500
houses each for low income families all over the country. To ensure cost-effective access to
credit for housing, government has undertaken to pick up a portion of the cost of financing on
behalf of the borrower over and above 8 percent under this program.

While addressing the audience, Mr. Akram Khan Durrani, Federal Minister for Housing &
Works who chaired the inaugural session, appreciated the steps taken by SBP to promote
housing finance. He stated that the provision of affordable housing and mortgage finance are
paramount to cope with rapid urbanization. He highlighted the various efforts by the
government to come up with affordable solutions particularly for people belonging to low
income strata and kachi abadis. He stated that SBP is actively involved in supporting the
sector. He emphasized that if proper planning is not undertaken for urbanization it may lead
to serious problems.

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, in his policy address shared
SBP’s policy framework for enhancing the flow of financial services to middle and low
income groups. Mr. Wathra, while asserting the importance of housing and housing finance
for the economy, said that the country is witnessing rapid urbanization and escalation in
property prices with increasing shortage of housing units especially for low and middle
income groups. In the absence of a sound and vibrant housing finance system, we can expect
the situation to further deteriorate. He appreciated DFID, World Bank, AFG and CSAPs for
their support in SBP/Mof efforts to improve upon financial inclusion in the country.

He further added that housing finance is one of the critical elements to make housing
affordable for the new entrants and existing incumbents of major metropolitan cities. The lack
of effective institutional framework, secondary mortgage market, high transaction costs,

Warehouse Receipt Financing can turnaround Pakistan’s
agriculture sector: Saeed Ahmad- Deputy Governor, SBP

The Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mr. Saeed Ahmad has said that Warehouse Receipt
Financing was one of the most important initiatives in terms of promoting post harvest agricultural
finance in the country. He was addressing leadership workshop on “Warehouse Receipt Financing in
Pakistan” organized jointly by SBP and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Karachi.

While addressing the senior executives from banking, insurance and development organizations, Mr.
Saeed Ahmad highlighted that in Pakistan, post harvest losses were estimated to be around 25-35%
of crops and horticulture irrespective of the fact that a big part of our population remained
malnourished.

He said that Pakistan is one of the leading agricultural producing countries in the world. However,
shortage of warehousing & storage facilities, lack of standardization, non existence of independent
collateral verification, lower access to financing and non-availability of transaction data has hampered
the development of an efficient commodity trading market. This in turn has led to excessive produce
wastages, high price volatility, and lower levels of farmers’ access to finance. He termed Warehouse
Receipt Financing as an initiative which could turn around the country’s agricultural landscape.

Deputy Governor informed the participants that SBP has been collaborating with SECP for formulating
a regulatory framework for establishment of commodity Warehouse Receipt Financing mechanism.
He appreciated the role of Pakistan Mercantile Exchange (PMEX), banks, insurance companies, FAO,
and other stakeholders and their joint efforts for scaling up of this financing system in the country.

He expressed his resolve and encouraged the participants to join in the efforts for the development
of a system to provide physical commodity storage, marketing, and Warehouse Receipt Financing
mechanisms in Pakistan. He assured that State Bank will continue to play its active role in this regard.

The event was also addressed by Syed Samar Hasnain- Executive Director SBP, Mr. Francisco
Gamarro- Deputy Representative FAO Pakistan, Mr. Krassimir Kiriakov- Expert Warehouse Receipt
Financing Voca Consultant UK, Mr. Fahadullah Khan- CEO ACE Global Depository Services Pakistan,
and Mr. Hasan Mahmood- Head of Research, Product Development & Risk Pakistan Mercantile
Exchange (PMEX).

Around 130 senior executives of banks, insurance companies, SECP, FAO, PMEX and other
stakeholders attended the event which was followed by a two day Training of Trainers (ToT) session
for around 50 participants from banks and other stakeholders.

ERD/M&PRD/PR/01/2020-91 August 24, 2020

Banks disbursed Rs 1,215 billion during FY 2019-20 to
agriculture sector amid COVID-19 pandemic

Banks disbursed Rs 1,215 billion to agriculture sector during FY 2019-20. This is 3.5 percent higher than
the amount disbursed in the previous fiscal year but less than the credit target of Rs 1,350 billion which
was Set by Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) in Peshawar in November 2019. Some factors
which have constrained the growth of agriculture credit include the impact of COVID-19 pandemic,
locust attack and continuing real side issues including water shortage, low production of cotton,
sugarcane, low off take of fertilizers and volatility in prices of agri. produce etc. The outstanding
portfolio of agriculture credit increased to Rs 581 billion at end June, 2020, registering growth of 3.3%
compared with the last year’s position of Rs 562 billion. However, the number of agriculture borrowers
declined from 4.01 million at end June 2019 to 3.74 million at end June 2020 due to the COVID-19
lockdown situation in the country.

The analysis of disbursement reveals that during FY 2019-20, five major commercial banks collectively
disbursed agriculture loans of Rs 708.3 billion or 100.5% of their annual target of Rs 705 billion,
specialized banks disbursed Rs 71.1 billion or 62.9% of their annual target of Rs 113 billion and fourteen
domestic private banks as a group achieved 88.7% by disbursing Rs 225.0 billion against their target of
Rs 253.6 billion. Further, the five Islamic Banks as a group achieved 76.6% of their annual target of Rs
55.0 billion by disbursing Rs 42.1 billion which is 6.1 % higher than the disbursement made during the
corresponding period last year. Similarly, the Islamic windows of commercial banks disbursed Rs 43.5
billion or 79.2% against the target of Rs 55.0 billion in FY 2019-20 which is 33 % higher from the
disbursement of Rs 32.7 billion made during last year.

The agriculture credit of microfinance sector remained relatively sluggish due to COVID-19 lockdown
in the 2nd half of FY 2019-20. The Microfinance Banks (MFBs) as a group have achieved 75.7% by
disbursing agriculture loans of Rs 139.3 billion to small farmers which is 9.5% lower than the
disbursement of Rs 154 billion during same period last year. Likewise, the Microfinance
Institutions/Rural Support Programs collectively achieved 73.4% of their targets by disbursing Rs 28.9
billion which is 15 % lower than the disbursement of Rs 34 billion made during the last year to small
and marginalized farmers.

It is important to mention that SBP announced a comprehensive relief package in collaboration with
stakeholders for relief of agriculture sector to deal with the adverse implications of the ongoing
pandemic on the farming community and agriculture business in the downstream of value chains.
These measures which included deferment of principal and restructuring/rescheduling of agriculture
loans were initially allowed uptill June 30, 2020 have been extended upto 30 September 2020. SBP will
continue to monitor the situation and it may introduce more measures to help the sector manage its

finances during this temporary phase of disruption.

Economic activities have gathered pace in Q1-FY16 and
need to be sustained, says SBP Quarterly Report

The State Bank of Pakistan submitted its First Quarterly Report of FY16 titled ‘The State of Pakistan’s
Economy’ to the Parliament today. According to the report, notable improvements in the key
macroeconomic indicators during the first quarter of the year can be observed; however, much needs to be
done to ensure their sustainability.

The report states, ‘Taking comfort from visible improvement in macroeconomic environment, SBP
initiated monetary easing in FY15, which continued during the first quarter of FY16. This policy stance
was augmented by a pro-growth budget for FY16. In addition, marked improvement in security
conditions, relatively better energy management, and persistently low global commodity prices, have
positioned the economy to further improve on its performance going forward.’

According to the SBP report, some improvements were already visible from the changes in key
macroeconomic indicators during the first quarter of the year. Economic activity seems to be gearing up as
large scale manufacturing recorded a noticeable increase over the last year. Further, the current account
deficit narrowed, which was comfortably financed by higher financial inflows; the country’s FX reserves
recorded all time high levels, and were sufficient to finance import bill of seven months; fiscal deficit was
reduced, along with a shift in its financing away from SBP; and inflation remained on low trajectory.

In the report, SBP mentions that while these positive developments are welcome, much needs to be done to
ensure their sustainability. Following are some points of concern:

Although budget deficit for Q1-FY16 was lower than the same period last year, tax collection could not
post the required growth. In order to keep the fiscal deficit within target without compromising on
development spending, tax efforts have to be increased manifold, particularly by widening tax base and
effective enforcement. It would be pertinent to mention here that with recent tax measures, FBR taxes have
shown a significant YoY growth of 16.8 percent in Jul-Nov FY16.

Loss making PSEs remained a contingent liability on scarce fiscal resources. The privatization process of
such PSEs is still at initial stages. This must be expedited to improve quality of services, and stem losses
to the exchequer;

Dwindling exports continued to eclipse overall healthy performance of the external sector. Specifically,
exports recorded a year-on-year decline for the 3"" quarter in a row. More disturbingly, this decline was
attributed primarily to lower quantum;

In addition to exports, FDI also needs to contribute more towards external sector sustainability. While it is
encouraging that FDI from China is likely to increase due to progress on various infrastructure projects
under the CPEC, the country also requires foreign investment in exportable sectors; and

Extreme weather conditions in recent years have increased vulnerability of Pakistan’s agricultural sector.
In FY16 also, Kharif crops (cotton and rice) have suffered from heavy rainfall.

Finally, the report adds, it is encouraging that 9"" review of the IMF program has been completed
successfully and several important reforms have been introduced, like independent statutory Monetary
Policy Committee, Credit Bureaus Act, etc. However, the slow progress on privatization process and

persistent distribution & transmission losses in the power sector remain a challenge.

SBP measures helped create
Rs 360 billion liquidity for banking system: Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, said today that the central bank
has taken several measures to ease liquidity crunch in the banking system which have
resulted in the creation of an additional Rs 360 billion indirect and direct liquidity.

Presiding over a meeting of the Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) held at
State Bank, Mr Raza said that to ease tight liquidity conditions arising from extraordinary
outflows from the banking system during October 2008, the State Bank took a series of
measures including liquidity injection through OMOs, reduction in cash reserve requirement,
exemption of time deposits (i.e. deposits of above one-year tenor) from statutory liquidity
requirement, enhancement of list of eligible securities for SLR and provision of 100 percent
refinance to banks against Export Finance Scheme, he added.

“These measures helped pump in direct and indirect liquidity of around Rs 360 billion in
the banking system at present compared with just Rs 79 billion in September 2008,” he said.
Mr Raza said that sufficient liquidity is available in the banking system and urged upon the
commercial banks to increase lending to productive sectors of the economy which will help
the country to stage a quick economic recovery.

He noted with concern that private sector credit, after recording an average growth of
19 percent during FY06 to FY08, witnessed deceleration in the first seven months of FY09
(July 08 to January 09) mainly due to slowdown in the economic activity coupled with global
recession. He said overall credit disbursement to the private sector expanded by Rs 158.4
billion during July 2008 to January 2009 and recorded a growth of 5.5 percent compared to
Rs 260.3 billion or 10.5 percent last year. On annualized basis, however, growth is 11.2
percent, which is lower than 17 percent last year, he added. During FYO9, private sector
credit expanded substantially till October 2008 as private sector availed credit of Rs 125.6
billion during the period 1st July-1st November 2008 compared to Rs 60.5 billion in the same
period last year. Thereafter, the credit- take-off started to decelerate and it increased by
only Rs 32.8 billion during 1°* November 2008 — 31° January 2009 as compared with Rs 199.8
billion in corresponding period last year.

SBP Governor told the participants that weak demand, high mark-up rates, rising non-
performing loans and past liquidity constraints are some of the important factors behind
decelearation in private sector credit disbursement.

He informed the meeting that credit disbursement to the agriculture sector through
banking system in first half of FYO9 remained at Rs 99.4 billion, up 10 percent over the
disbursement of Rs 90.3 billion in the same period last year, against an annual target of
Rs 250 billion.

SBP GOVERNOR CHAIRS MEETING:
REPLACEMENT OF BADLA FINANCING
WITH MARGIN FINANCING
A meeting was held under the Chairmanship of Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Ishrat
Husain at SBP Karachi today to assess the status of preparedness of financial institutions for
undertaking margin financing and to chart out the future course of action to ensure smooth
transition from Carry Over Transaction (COT) Financing or Badla Financing to Margin

Financing.

The meeting was attended, among others, by the Minister of State for Finance, Mr. Omar
Ayub Khan, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Tawfiq A. Husain, Chairman
SECP, Dr. Tariq Hassan, Commissioner SECP, Mr. Shahid Ghaffar, Chairman KSE, Mr.

Yasin Lakhani, leading brokers and heads of commercial banks.

The financial institutions indicated that they will be able to provide over Rs.20 billion for
margin financing. This will exceed the present level of commitments in COT market by Rs.7
billion. The bankers informed the meeting that additional funds may be provided, if the
demand for margin financing remains unmet. It was agreed that concerted efforts of all
stakeholders and seamless coordination were needed to achieve the desired results by the
deadline of August 26, 2005 and a Committee comprising the representatives of banks,
financial institutions and members of the three stock exchanges was constituted to ensure the
smooth implementation of the phase-out of Badla in a timely manner. The Committee was
also given the responsibility of disseminating the information and create awareness amongst

all the stakeholders, particularly the small investors.

Addressing the meeting, Mr. Omar Ayub apprised the participants about the important and
critical role played by the Capital Market in the development of an economy. He said that
the Government is fully committed to the reforms being undertaken by the regulators and his
presence in the meeting is a solid demonstration of the will of the Government to work
closely with all the stakeholders for ensuring the stability and development of the capital

market.

The Chairman SECP, Dr. Tariq Hassan briefly apprised the meeting about the risk
Management measures and other reforms that have so far been undertaken for strengthening

the capital market.

State Bank facilitates overseas Pakistanis for biometric verification
of their bank accounts

Realizing difficulties being faced by overseas Pakistan in operating their bank accounts due to non-
biometric verification of their accounts, State Bank of Pakistan has issued detailed instructions on the
alternate arrangement to facilitate their biometric verification.

It may be mentioned here that as per alternate arrangement, overseas Pakistanis may approach their
respective banks through email/surface mail and provide identity documents like valid Passport, Visa,
CNIC and NICOP (National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis) as an alternative arrangement for
biometric verification for operating their bank accounts as usual. In this regard, detailed instructions
regarding biometric verification are available at: http://www.sbp.org.pk/bprd/2019/CL16.htm

The arrangement has been made in line with State Bank’s continuous monitoring of the progress of the

banking industry with respect to biometric verification; and it has been reiterated to banks for
extending their fullest cooperation to their overseas customers.

Prime Minister Inaugurates Roshan Digital Account — An Initiative of SBP

Prime Minister Imran Khan today inaugurated the Roshan Digital Account in a ceremony in Islamabad. The
Roshan Digital Account is a new initiative of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in partnership with major
banks in Pakistan.

The Roshan Digital Account is for non-resident Pakistanis (NRPs). Through this account, NRPs will be fully
integrated with Pakistan’s banking and payments system. For the first time in the country’s history, NRPs
will be able to open an account in Pakistan without requiring physical presence either in Pakistan or in any
embassy or consulate. This account will provide them access to a full range of banking services and exciting
investment opportunities in Pakistan from wherever they live, including the soon to be launched Naya
Pakistan Certificates issued by the government, as well as the stock market and real estate. Funds in these
accounts will also be fully repatriable, such that they can be remitted back from Pakistan without any prior
approval from SBP.

Addressing the audience, the Prime Minister dedicated the occasion to overseas Pakistanis, noting that
they have always made Pakistan proud through their achievements and dedication to their motherland.
He was delighted that SBP was offering a new channel to connect overseas Pakistanis with their
motherland financially and congratulated the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, on this initiative.

The Prime Minister called overseas Pakistanis the greatest resource of the country. He said that in many
parts of the world, expatriates have played an important role in the development of their countries.
However, he regretted that Pakistan has historically been unable to tap its diaspora effectively. However,
he remarked that his government is committed to better integrating overseas Pakistanis into the local
economy, and that the Roshan Digital Account is very important first step in this direction.

The Prime Minister highlighted that the country needs more investment from abroad to fund the current
account deficit and raise foreign exchange reserves. In this context, he remarked that overseas Pakistanis
can help the country by investing in recently announced mega projects of the country through the Roshan
Digital Account. In particular, he emphasized the on-going boom in the housing sector, which provides
very attractive investment opportunities for overseas Pakistanis.

In his address, Governor SBP Dr. Reza Baqir noted that the Roshan Digital Account represents a new era in
the banking system of Pakistan, as it features a completely digital on-boarding process. To enable this
historic change, SBP introduced all the necessary amendments to existing rules and regulations. He
explained that these accounts will initially be available through eight major banks in Pakistan, with more
banks added in due course.

The Governor said that today we have crossed another milestone as part of SBP’s commitment to a digital
financial ecosystem for Pakistan’s economy and in keeping with the Prime Minister’s vision. He highlighted
that the name of the account reflected the ethos of NRPs, who make their country proud through their
hard work and passion. It is to these star performers abroad that the “Roshan” account is dedicated, he
said.

The Governor highlighted that opening the account will require a basic set of information and documents.
Banks have been asked to complete all necessary customer due diligence within 48 hours after receiving
complete information. He assured NRPs that SBP and the banks were committed to providing them a
world-class user experience and to proactively resolving any problems they may encounter during the roll-
out of the initiative. In this context, he highlighted the dedicated customer support and monitoring system
established by SBP and the banks.

SBP Takes Major Steps to Boost Digital Payments in the Country

To further improve the digital payment services landscape in the country and promote financial
inclusion, SBP has issued instructions to the banking industry for improving the acceptance of payment
cards in the country. Specifically, SBP has taken three steps: one, the banks are now bound to offer the
domestic payment scheme card, PayPak, to the customers as a first priority, whereas cards of
international payment schemes like Visa, MasterCard and Union Pay may be issued on the request of
the customer. Two, the merchant discount rate (MDR) i.e. the fee charged by banks to the merchants,
will now be in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Earlier banks were allowed to charge any fee to the
merchants. Three, the distribution of revenues generated from a merchant among the players
including card issuer, card machine deploying entity and the payment scheme company, has also been
rationalised to keep the incentives equitable among all the players. These measures are expected to
increase payment card acceptance access points in the country and in turn will also help in digitizing
the economy and promoting financial inclusion.

Addressing another gap in cheque clearing whereby it took weeks to clear cheques in far flung areas of
the country, SBP has allowed the use of Pakistan Real Time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM)
for the settlement of cheques. This is expected to decrease the processing time for clearing of payment
instruments in areas that are not easily accessible. This will also help the financial institutions in far
flung areas to leverage digital channels for their clearing and settlement obligations.

It may be recalled that SBP launched the National Payment Systems Strategy in November 2019 and
has since taken a number of steps to promote digitization of payment transactions in the country.

The National Payment Systems strategy is available at http://www.sbp.org.pk/PS/PDF/NPSS.pdf

SBP acquires Pakistan Security Printing Corporation

The State Bank of Pakistan has acquired the banknotes and prize bonds printing functions of
Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) from the Federal Government. The other security
printing functions of PSPC including printing of passports, National ID Cards, stamp papers etc
have been separated and vested in National Security Printing Company (Private) Limited (NSPC), a
newly established company fully owned by the Federal Government.

The SBP being the sole issuer of banknotes in the country gives utmost importance to the integrity
and quality of banknotes. In order to have full control over the process of banknotes
manufacturing and issuance, the SBP has been in negotiations with the Federal Government for
over two years to acquire the banknotes and prize bonds printing function of PSPC. This was in line
with the global and regional trends as a number of central banks including Central Bank of France,
Turkey, Italy, Australia, India and various other central banks have their own banknotes printing
facilities.

The Federal Government, while agreeing to the Bank’s proposal has separated the PSPC functions
into banknote and prize bond printing and other security printing (OSP) units. The OSP business
has been assigned to National Security Printing Company NSPC, whereas the remaining PSPC
having core function of banknotes and prize bond printing has been sold to SBP. The Bank has paid
a consideration of Rs 100.149 billion to the GoP during the month of June, 2017 for transfer of
ownership and control, based on the fair value as determined by an independent consultant
appointed for this purpose.

The SBP has since assumed control of the PSPC and deputed Mr. Muhammad Haroon Rasheed
Malik, Executive Director of the Bank, as Managing Director of the company. The SBP is committed
to run the PSPC as its fully owned subsidiary through an independent Board of Directors, in
accordance with corporate governance best practices.

Branchless banking shows impressive
growth in first quarter of FY12

Branchless banking in Pakistan has shown an impressive growth in the first quarter of
the current fiscal year (FY12) according to the latest SBP publication: ‘Branchless Banking
News’ posted on its website ( www.sbp.org.pk) today.

According to the publication, branchless banking would prove a game-changer in
improving access of unbanked population to financial services in Pakistan. The total number of
active branchless banking agents reached to 17,448 in a short span of two years whereas
number of branches of all commercial banks is almost 10,000. The total number of active
branchless banking accounts increased by 51.23 percent to 357,598, total branchless banking
deposits by 28.03 percent to Rs 187 million, number of transactions by 26.93 percent to 15.867
million and the volume of transactions by 43.20 percent to Rs 58,710 million during the July-
September, 2011 quarter.

The average size of branchless banking transaction is Rs 3,700 while the average number
of transaction per day is 176,296 in the first quarter of FY12, showing evidence of the access of
these services to poor and low-income group. Almost half of its users did not have a bank
account and almost two-thirds used the service regularly. These results hint at the considerable
un-met demand for efficient, low cost and accessible financial services.

Pakistan has huge potential in the area of branchless banking as mobile phone banking
has successfully emerged in Pakistan after the issuance of branchless banking regulations in
March, 2008.

The early success of mobile banking in Pakistan is attributable to the collaborative
efforts of a wide range of stakeholders, including Government, regulatory authorities,
development agencies, NADRA, telecom operators, financial institutions, and technology firms.

The innovative branchless banking models have been penetrating in areas of massive
payments such as utility bills, Government-to-persons, persons-to-persons payments while
poising for scaling up for other services relating to deposits and loans.

The branchless banking models are witnessing growth but they are still in early-phase
experimentation, requiring understanding of critical issues and taking measures to expand
retail networks and leverage technologies. Once these models reach to a degree of maturity,
the inter-operability will come in to facilitate customers to send money to anyone with account
at any bank, and do cash-in and cash-out with agent of any bank. Getting to this ultimate stage
will be both exciting and challenging.

SBP amends its PRs for housing finance to allow financing to individuals for Solar Systems for
residential use

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has been extending its endeavors to enhance the housing financing in Pakistan
by creating an enabling regulatory environment through conducive Prudential Regulations (PRs) and
market development through issuance of guidelines, setting indicative targets and promoting capacity
building of financial institutions, etc.

Keeping in view current energy crises in Pakistan and to promote alternative energy solutions at
affordable finance, SBP amended its housing finance PRs to allow banks for extension of loans to
individuals for solar energy solutions for residential use as part of home loans. Previously, financial
institutions were extending finances for solar system under the head of personal loan for maximum
tenure of 5 years. However, after this amendment in Housing Finance PRs, banks/DFls can finance to
individuals for solar energy systems maximum upto ten years which will make financing affordable for
the borrower.

SBP believes that this facility will increase the use of solar energy solutions at household level and will
also increase housing finance in Pakistan. Outreach of housing finance in Pakistan, in terms of income
groups and geography is very limited.

Housing and construction plays an important role in an economy. Around 50 industries and 70 percent of
the unskilled labour are associated with construction sector. Housing finance supplements radically in
long-term economic growth via job creation, economic linkages and in raising living standards of people.

Remittances by Authorized Dealers on behalf of Umrah Organizers

In order to facilitate the Umrah Organizers to meet the Umrah related expenses on account of Pakistani
pilgrims in Saudi Arabia such as accommodation, transportation etc., State Bank of Pakistan has allowed
Authorized Dealers to affect remittances on behalf of Umrah Organizers directly to vendors/services
providers in Saudi Arabia through banking channel.

Further, Authorized Dealers have also been allowed to affect advance remittances on behalf of Umrah
Organizers for making prior arrangements regarding the above mentioned services in Saudi Arabia.

The State Bank expects that while the above remittance mechanism would enable Umrah Organizers to
conduct their operations smoothly, it would also help in minimizing the possibility of funds transfer
through informal channels from Pakistan.

It may be recalled that earlier the State Bank had allowed Authorized Dealers to affect Hajj related
remittances on behalf of Hajj Group Organizers to Saudi Arabia through interbank market.

Imports from Afghanistan against Registration of Contract
through Electronic Import Form

It may be recalled that all imports into Pakistan are required to be made compulsorily
through Electronic Import Form (EIF). The EIF was implemented with a view to curb the
illegal and duplicate payments of imports from Pakistan by unscrupulous elements.

In this regard, it was observed that due to peculiar nature of trade with Afghanistan through
land routes, especially via Torkham and Chaman borders, Pakistani importers were facing
difficulties to carry out import transactions through EIF.

In order to address these difficulties and to facilitate traders of the above regions, the
procedure for registration of contracts and payments thereagainst has been simplified. Now,
the requirement for routing of shipping documents against registered contract through
banks shall not be mandatory for imports from Afghanistan through land routes. The
Pakistani importers may now directly receive shipping documents from the Afghani exporters
and get the goods cleared after attachment of Goods Declaration(s) with EIF. Once the
importer gets the contract registered and EIF approved with the bank for multiple shipments,
the importers shall not be required to approach the bank again and again for approval of EIF.

The relaxation is expected to provide manifold benefits to the importers of above region by

reducing their cost of doing business and efficient processing of goods clearance at Customs
Stations bordering Afghanistan.

State Bank Announces Measures to Facilitate Export—Oriented Sectors and
Manufacturing Concerns

In an effort to further facilitate the exporters as well as the manufacturing sectors, SBP has allowed
exporters to directly dispatch the shipping documents of their exports’ consignment to their foreign
buyers without any limit, subject to condition that the exporter’s export over-dues are less than one
percent and the exporter has exports of at least USD 5 million during the previous three years. Earlier,
exporters could dispatch the shipping documents directly to their foreign buyers for export
consignments of up to USD 100,000/, or equivalent in other currencies. This limit was in place since
2017.

Moreover, SBP has enhanced the existing limit of USD 10,000/, or equivalent in other currencies, per
invoice allowed to banks to make advance payment on behalf of manufacturing & industrial concerns
and commercial importers for import of raw material, spare parts and machinery, to USD 25,000/.

These measures are in continuation of facilitating export-oriented industries and manufacturing
concerns in the backdrop of ease of doing business and promoting exports’ growth and will further
contribute in improving economic outlook of the country.

It is pertinent to mention here that in January 2020, SBP had taken certain measures to facilitate export-
oriented industries and manufacturing concerns. These included:

1. Extending the facility to make advance payment up to USD 10,000/, or equivalent in other
currencies, per invoice, for import of raw material, spare parts and machinery to commercial
importers as well in addition to manufacturing & industrial concerns, allowed earlier.

2. Allowing Authorized Dealers to effect import advance payment against irrevocable letter of
credit, up to 100% of the value of letter of credit, for import of plant, machinery, spare parts
and raw material etc. on behalf of manufacturing concerns for their own use only.

3. Extending the facility allowed to manufacturing & industrial concerns for import of raw
materials and spare parts on open account basis to commercial importers as well.

SBP takes measures to promote Digital Payments amid COVID-19 Pandemic

In the wake of the recent outbreak of COVID19 (Corona virus), SBP is undertaking a number of
measures to contribute towards meeting the challenges faced by society to remain safe from
this pandemic and its potential impact. Given the pivotal role of financial sector in providing
services to the general public and particularly the businesses, SBP after consultation with
stakeholders has instructed banks to take specific measures to provide their services
seamlessly taking due care of reducing the risk exposure amid corona virus.

The objective of these measures is to reduce the need for visiting bank branches or the ATMs
and to promote use of Digital Payment Services such as internet banking, mobile phone
banking etc.

SBP has instructed banks to waive all charges on fund transfers through online banking
channels such as Inter Bank Fund Transfer (IBFT) and SBP’s Real Time Gross Settlement System
for customers. Thus people can transfer money through mobile phones or internet banking
avoiding the need to visit a bank branch or an ATM without incurring any cost. They will also
not incur any cost in case of using ATMs or visiting bank branches for transferring large
amounts and can avoid the use of cash. Banks have been advised to facilitate their customers
in using online banking while taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security
of customer’s funds. Further, they will also ensure that call centres/helplines are available 24/7
for instant customer support.

Financial industry has been instructed to immediately facilitate education fee and loan
repayments through internet banking or mobile devices. Financial institutions shall also run
awareness campaigns through different channels to educate customers to use internet
banking or mobile phones, limit use of currency notes and restrict branch visits. Anticipating
any frauds in the wake of digital transactions, SBP has advised financial industry to increase
vigilance on digital channels and increase monitoring on cyber threats.

SBP expects that all these measures will help to continue meeting routine financial service
needs of bank customers. COVID19 has challenged human life globally and all the countries
are struggling to find out solutions; the key approach, so far, has been to take precautionary
measures. SBP is working with stakeholders to continuously assessing the situation and will
take every possible measure to improve the safety of public.

Prime Minister launches scheme for promotion of home remittances through M-wallets

 

Prime Minister Mr. Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that Government of Pakistan is taking several strategic
initiatives to promote inflow of home remittances in the country. ‘In continuation of our efforts, | am
pleased that GoP in collaboration with the SBP and financial industry is launching a scheme for

promotion of home remittances through m-wallets, he said.

He was addressing the launching ceremony of ‘Promotion of Home Remittances through M-wallet
Accounts.’ The Prime Minister said that the scheme will help in channelizing home remittances through
Branchless Banking (BB) channels. ‘It will help achieve twin objectives’, said the PM, ‘Firstly, it will
facilitate the populace by provision of home remittances in swift, convenient and cost effective manner
by utilizing the network of BB agents across Pakistan; secondly, it will help enhance the usage of m-
wallets and creation of digital accounts.’ Mr. Abbasi also announced Government’s budgetary support to
incentivize home remittances through M—Wallet accounts.

The Prime Minister reminded the audience that since 2013, after coming to power, his party had made
significant strides as it stabilized economy, accelerated GDP growth and introduced structural reforms to
uplift the living conditions of the common man. He said that financial inclusion is considered as one of
the key instruments for economic development. ‘Unfortunately, Pakistan is among the countries
accounting for around 5 percent of the world’s unbanked population,’ he said adding ’In Pakistan only
23% of the adult population has access to formal financial services.’

Mr. Abbasi said that in Pakistan remittances have been the second-highest source of foreign exchange
earnings for the country, after export receipts. ‘Over the past 10 years, remittances have grown at a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 12 percent — one of the highest growth rates for any
country in the world,’ he said adding, ‘Pakistan’s relatively better performance in the region is principally
attributed to sustained increase in emigrant workers during past few years and supportive policies of
the Government and the State Bank.’ He also appreciated the role of the Pakistan Remittance Initiative

(PRI) in strong growth in remittances.

Earlier, in his welcoming address, the Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mr. Tariq Bajwa thanked
the Prime Minister for his visit to SBP and launching this important initiative. Introducing the scheme of
home remittances through M-Wallets, the Governor stated that that it will help to achieve two
objectives: one, increasing financial inclusion in the country; and, two, making transfer of home
remittances faster and at low cost, thus competing with informal channels of delivery.

23rd Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture -- Lessons from the Role
of People’s Bank of China in China’s Economic Rise

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) organized the 23rd Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture on April 19,
2019 at SBP Karachi. Mr. Zhou Xiaochuan, ex-Governor Peoples Bank of China, delivered the
lecture on “Lessons from the Role of Peoples Bank of China in China’s Economic Rise”.

In his lecture, Mr. Zhou stated, “reforms in Peoples Bank of China reflect China’s gradualist
approach towards globalization for sustainable economic development”. He emphasized on
gradual liberalization of exchange rate, monetary and capital account regimes to facilitate
greater role for market forces without large-scale disturbances. He also elaborated how
Peoples Bank of China provided incentive structures to channelize financial resources
towards productive sectors to ensure inclusive growth and financial stability.

Referring to Pakistan, Mr. Zhou emphasized to raise the domestic savings rate in order to
address most of the macroeconomic imbalances including current and fiscal deficits. Further,
he suggested using regional currencies in order to facilitate trade in the region.

It may be recalled that SBP organizes almost every year a lecture in the honor of its first
governor (late) Mr. Zahid Husain to cherish his meritorious services for this nation. Eminent
economists are invited from across the world to deliver this lecture.

Earlier while delivering his welcome address, Governor SBP Mr. Tariq Bajwa, emphasized the
role of central banks in provision of conducive environment for sustainable development. He
also highlighted the efforts of SBP for inclusive economic development in Pakistan and
mentioned initiatives to promote financial inclusion, agriculture and SME financing,
mortgage lending, green banking and electronic payment systems to underscore torch-
bearing role of SBP in economic growth and development of Pakistan.

Justice (retd.), Mr. Nasir Aslam Zahid, son of (late) Mr. Zahid Husain, graced the occasion as
chief guest. The lecture was attended by an august gathering including policy-makers,

SBP releases Annual Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Annual Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy for the fiscal
year 2018-19 today. According to the report, several policy measures were taken during the year to
manage the twin deficits crisis. In particular, adjustment of exchange rate to market fundamentals,
curtailment in public sector development expenditure, and increase in energy prices helped contain
demand pressures, leading to a welcome reduction in the current account deficit. In this process,
however, the large-scale manufacturing sector faced contraction and inflation increased. SBP
continued to maintain tight monetary conditions to manage demand and anchor inflation expectations.
The SBP’s monetary policy committee (MPC) increased the policy rate in all six decisions during the
year, by a cumulative 575 bps.

Reduction in demand pressures coupled with supply side constraints led to the slowing down of
economic growth during the year. While all the sectors contributed towards this performance, the
major drag came from the commodity-producing sectors, namely agriculture and industry. On the
agriculture front, water shortages along with rise in input prices undermined the sector’s output.

The report identifies that despite significant reduction in imports and high level of financial inflows
from friendly countries, the overall foreign exchange reserve position remained challenging, as
financing of external obligations and current account deficit became difficult. Thus, to meet this
challenges, Pakistan signed an agreement with the IMF towards the end of FY19 for balance of payment
support.

The report also explores other developments that remained a source of concern in FY19. For instance,
despite sharp decline in development spending, the overall fiscal deficit reached a historic high in FY19;
this reveals the fundamental structural deficiencies in the country’s tax system. In addition, the report
calls attention to the steady increase in headline inflation during the year. While the hike in energy
prices and pass through of PKR-depreciation fueled inflation throughout FY19, the upward pressure on
prices during the first half of the year could be partly attributed to a demand overhang from FY18 as
well. The annual report also outlines the factors which held back the performance of exports in value
terms during the review period.

Furthermore, the report points out that certain structural imbalances have been building up over time,
in particular the rise in share of non-tradeable services in GDP (which do not add to the exports base),
at the expense of the declining share of the commodity-producing sectors. The report underlines the
need to focus on structural reforms aimed at increasing the competitiveness of Pakistan goods,
adapting to the international trends and shifting towards exportable services. It also stresses upon
improvement in human capital and productivity for sustainable future growth.

Additionally, the report features a special chapter dedicated to the factors constraining investment in
Pakistan, particularly beyond the conventional macroeconomic factors. The chapter identifies the
binding policy and legal and institutional constraints that are undermining the country’s ability to
mobilize investments to its full potential. It describes challenges faced by investors when it comes to
dispute settlements, policy advocacy and retention practices, while emphasizing the weaknesses in the
tax collection machinery. The chapter also reflects upon the ongoing policy reforms for improving the
investment environment and stresses upon elements that will be crucial in future for addressing the
problem of under-investment in the country.

The detailed report is available at SBP’s website: www.sbp.org.pk

BRANCHLESS BANKING SHOWS ROBUST GROWTH

Branchless banking (BB) transactions showed a robust growth of 29% during the quarter July —
September, 2013 to reach Rs 224 billion, whilst BB accounts climbed up by 12% leading to 2.96 million
BB accounts operating in the country.

According to State Bank of Pakistan’s latest Branchless Banking Newsletter, 51.9 million BB
transactions were recorded during Jul-Sep, 2013, which is 16% higher than that in the previous quarter.
The growth demonstrated stems from small-value transactions averaging Rs.4,315 largely carried out by
unbanked segment of population for domestic remittances, social welfare payments such as BISP,
Watan Card etc, pension payments, and utility bill payments. Owing to SBP’s supportive policy
environment for branchless banking, these BB services are being offered at alternative delivery channels
in the form of agent network, mobile phones, ATMs, and PoS.

The agent network continued to rapidly expand and has reached 110,214 in number. This fast
expansion has also been fueled by the trend of using shared agents by the providers.

According to the newsletter, over the counter (OTC) transactions were 41.87 million worth
Rs.116.8 billion, demonstrating growth of 12% in volume, and 24% in value, during the quarter.
Meanwhile, 7.2 million m-wallet transactions, valuing Rs 13.6 billion were performed, signifying 32%
growth in volume and 44% in value during the quarter. Even though OTC transactions, with a share of
81% in overall number of BB transactions dominated over m-wallet transactions which seized a share of
14%, if compared to last quarter a slight pickup of 2% share in m-wallets transactions has been
observed.

The BB market, currently consisting of eight players, is gradually becoming competitive and
innovative. According to the newsletter, international consultants from World Bank testified in a
workshop held at SBP in December 2013 that SBP’s policy framework for BB and financial inclusion is in
sync with the best approach for optimally managing linkages between financial inclusion and central
banks’ traditionally core objectives of financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection.

Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association delegation
holds meeting with Governor, State Bank of Pakistan

A five-member delegation of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association (PBEA)
led by its Chairman, Mr. Shabir Ahmed met the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar at SBP, Karachi today.

The delegation while highlighting the performance of the Association apprised the
Governor of exporters’ concern over the increased cost of financing, which is rendering
the sector non-competitive in comparison to other regional suppliers especially to the
US/EU market. The group proposed a rebate on interest rate for Bedwear Exporters
Association and indicated that India was offering such a facility to its exporters. It
presented a study of Bangladesh and Pakistan bedwear industry.

The SBP Governor pointed out that first, on an overall basis, the export growth
has been quite robust given the support of export refinance and other measures. Second,
the interest cost is one component of the overall cost structure of exports and there are
industry and infrastructure specific constraints, which have more implications of export
competitiveness. Third, the interest rates have been high largely because of the continued
inflationary pressure that stems from a number of factors. From the central bank’s
perspective, we need to continue monitoring the situation, she added.

She emphasized that while broader macro-economic objectives of containment of
inflation are important for the overall growth of the economy, the sector must also
evaluate its own competitiveness/efficiency and strives to find answers to compete with

regional market players with a long term perspective.

two initial pilot projects, one on the Government land model and the other on the private
sector builders’ model. It was decided that the volunteering banks will hold meetings with
NAPHDA on the financing of government land model and developer finance during the current
week and will present their reports in the next weekly meeting of the Steering Committee.

SBP consults stakeholders on the new National Payment Systems Strategy

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) organized a workshop titled ‘Digital Payments Reforms’ in
collaboration with the World Bank today at its headquarters in Karachi. The objective of the
workshop was to share the draft National Payment Systems Strategy and solicit the input of
key stakeholders involved in its implementation. The workshop was attended by senior
officials from PTA, NADRA, SECP, FBR, the PM office’s Strategic Reforms and Implementation
Unit, Banks, Telcos, Electronic Money Institution (EMIs), PSO/PSPs and Fintechs. Governor
SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir led the workshop, while Chairman PTA, Major General (Retired) Amir
Azeem Bajwa, and Country Director World Bank, Illango Patchamuthu were also present at

the occasion.

Addressing the workshop, the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, highlighted the issues that have
been longstanding and needed attention of all the stakeholders. The Governor emphasized
the need for rapid digitization of payments in order to realize the full benefits for the
economy as cash is still the preferred mode of payments for our routine and day to day
activities. He noted that the heavy reliance on cash and the limited use of digital channels
reduces economic efficiency, hinders financial and economic development and impedes the
goal of documenting the economy. To address these issues, he emphasized the importance
of building a modern and robust payment system in the country that enables the provision of
cost effective and easily available digital financial services to the general public. This, he

stated is a key strategic objective of SBP.

Governor Baqir shared SBP’s plans for leading an aggressive adoption and implementation of
the National Payment Systems Strategy in the country. He emphasized that interoperability is
key to achieving faster digitization goals. Governor also informed the participants that a new
faster payment gateway will be launched next year to facilitate instant transfer of funds. He
identified government payments and receipts and merchant payments to be the key
elements in accelerating digitization of payments in the country. He also noted the need for

reducing the high cost, especially the interchange fee in the payments industry and

Monetary Policy Statement
November 22, 2019

1. At its meeting on 22.4 November 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the
policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC’s view that recent developments have
had offsetting implications for the inflation outlook. On the one hand, recent inflation outturns have been on
the higher side. On the other, the causes behind these outturns have primarily been increases in food prices
which are expected to be temporary. Also market sentiment has begun to gradually improve on the back of
sustained improvements in the current account and continued fiscal prudence. The MPC noted that the SBP’s
projection for average inflation for FY20 remained broadly unchanged at 11 — 12 percent and maintaining the
current monetary policy stance was appropriate.

2. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key developments since the last MPC meeting,
developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and

inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

3. ‘There have been three key developments since the last MPC meeting. One, the current account balance
recorded a surplus in October 2019 after a gap of four years, a clear indication of receding pressures on the
country’s external accounts. Two, the government’s primary balance is estimated to record a surplus in the
first quarter of FY20, a first since Q2-FY16. This, together with the end of deficit monetization has

 

qualitatively improved the inflation outlook. Three, the most recent business confidence survey shows that
businesses expect inflation to fall in the near term suggesting that inflation expectations remain anchored
despite the recent increases in food prices.

Real sector

4. Recent economic data suggest that economic activity is strengthening in export oriented and import
competing sectors while inward oriented sectors continue to experience a slowdown in activity. Specifically,
large-scale manufacturing (LSM) shows gains in electronics, engineering goods and fertilizer sectors and
decline in auto, food, and construction allied industries of steel and cement. The latest production estimates
of major &barif crops suggest that agriculture sector is likely to grow in line with projections although cotton
production is likely to remain below target. In sum, the SBP kept its projection for GDP growth for FY20
unchanged at around 3.5 percent.

External sector

5. The external sector continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the benefits of recent policy
adjustments and other factors. In the first four months of the current fiscal year, the current account deficit
contracted by 73.5 percent to US$ 1.5 billion. This improvement reflected a notable reduction in imports, a
modest growth in exports and steady workers’ remittances. Export volumes, especially of rice, textile made-
ups, leather products, and fish & meat, increased despite weakening external demand. The capital and
financial account have also improved due to higher FDI and continued portfolio inflows reflecting renewed
investor confidence.

6. On account of favorable balance of payment developments, the rupee has appreciated 5.6 percent since
its low in June 2019. These favorable developments have allowed the SBP to begin rebuilding gross reserves

SBP sets Agriculture Credit Disbursement target of Rs 500 billion for 2014-15

 

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has set Agriculture Credit Disbursement Target of Rs 500 billion for
2014-15 to facilitate growth in agricultural production. This was announced in the annual meeting of
the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held at SBP, Lahore on 12"" July 2014. The
Finance Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Ishaque Dar graced the occasion after the meeting to encourage all
stake holders and the banking community for their support to agricultural sector.

Addressing the meeting, Governor SBP said the Finance Minister and the government has a keen
interest and high commitment to upgrade this vital sector of the economy, which is essential for
achieving the broader national objectives of rapid economic growth and alleviation of poverty.

Highlighting the role of agriculture in Pakistan, he said that agriculture sector is an essential
component accounting for around 20 percent of GDP and employs nearly half of the labor force. The
sector directly supports three-quarters of the population and contributes a large share of foreign
exchange earnings to the country. The Governor also emphasized that to increase agriculture
production and foster its growth, we need to increase productivity through optimum utilization of
resources and use of advanced farming techniques. The sector has a lot of potential which can be
better tapped by making available the required financial resources as and when needed.

Referring to SBP’s initiatives for improving access to finance to the farming community, the
Governor told that as per provisional figures, around Rs 389 billion have been disbursed by the end
of FY 2013-14 (by 30th June 2014), thus surpassing the revised target of Rs 380 billion.

Mr. Wathra said that SBP has long been making efforts to enhance the flow of credit to agriculture;
resultantly, the agricultural disbursements registered steady growth and rose to Rs 333 billion in FY
2012-13 from Rs 169 billion in FY 2006-07 recording an annual growth of over 10 percent. The
revised target for 2013-14 was set at Rs. 380 billion which was rather challenging for both SBP and
banks which was however not only met but superseded.

Referring to the indicative target for 2014-15 of Rs 500 billion assigned by the Government, he
expressed that “we, as a banking community, gladly accept it as a challenge and are fully committed
to accomplish this ambitious target”. He further elaborated that while SBP has developed a strategy
to achieve this target, however, this will require high level of commitment from banks’ Board of
Directors and their top management.

The Governor requested the national and provincial government representatives to give their
assurance and commitment to provide all kinds of support to the banking industry, especially
agriculture lending banks for smooth operations. He also urged upon banks that this is a high time to
play a meaningful role in the achievement of national goals of growth and development by
channeling adequate financial resources to the agriculture sector. The Governor also pointed out
that the share of banks’ credit to agriculture is around 5.7% of their total advances and the total
outreach is to just over 2.15 million borrowers as against 8.3 million farm households in the country.
This indicates ample room for enhancement of agriculture portfolio by the banks. Further, according
to estimates, only 35 to 40 percent credit requirement of agricultural sector is being met by the
formal banking system while the remaining is fulfilled through non-institutional credit sources.

National Debt Retirement Program-Repayment of Deposits under NDRP-II

It may be recalled that Government of Pakistan launched National Debt Retirement Program (NDRP)
with a view to discharge the ever increasing national debt liabilities. Amounts in NDRP were to be
accepted from an individual, firm, company, body and institutions etc. under the categories of
Donations (NDRP-I); Qarz-e-Hasna (NDRP-II) and Term Deposit (NDRP-III).

The deposits under NDRP-I (Donations) were non-refundable whereas deposits under NDRP-II and
NDRP-III were for a minimum period of two years. Depositors were issued a receipt/certificate against
deposits under NDRP-II by banks and Special Saving Certificates (SSC) /Defence Saving Certificates (DSC)
were issued against deposits under NDRP-III by Central Directorate of National Savings, Ministry of
Finance. After maturity of two years, the depositors were able to encash their amounts at par in case of
NDRP-II and as per terms & conditions of SSC / DSC for deposits under NDRP-III.

It has come to our notice that some of the deposits with banks under NDRP-II are pending or still unpaid.
All such depositors may approach their respective branch of banks along with the original
receipt/certificate for encashment of their deposits under NDRP-Il (Qarz-e-Hasna). The commercial
banks have also been advised to facilitate the claimants and encash the deposits after due verification in
accordance with respective rules & procedures. The banks after making the payments will claim
reimbursement from SBP against the deposit of paid documents and instruments etc.

SBP issues ‘Guidelines on Islamic Financing for Agriculture’

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued “Guidelines on Islamic Financing for
Agriculture” to help banks develop specific Shariah compliant products in order to meet the
financing needs of the farming community. These Guidelines have been developed in
consultation with stakeholders while keeping in view the potential and demand for Islamic
banking products in the field of agriculture.

The Guidelines broadly cover Islamic modes of financing like Murabaha, Ijara,
Musawamah, Salam, Istisna, Musharaka, Diminishing Musharaka, Mudaraba, Muzara’a,
Musagat, and Mugharasa that can be used for meeting the financing requirements of farm and
non farm sector activities including livestock, fisheries, poultry, orchards etc. In addition to
these financing needs, IBIs may also refer to SBP guidelines and instructions for crop and
non crop sector activities like guidelines on livestock, fisheries, poultry, horticulture, etc to
make further progress on this front. Moreover, the Guidelines have also explained the
application and procedure of the Islamic modes of financing.

The State Bank has advised all the banks to use these guidelines for developing their
own Shariah compliant products for extending finance to agriculture sector according to their
policy and operational & market requirements, subject to compliance with SBP regulations
and approval from their Shariah Advisor.

The Guidelines will facilitate Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs), particularly those
who are extending their branch network and outreach in the rural areas, to develop their own
products to meet the financing needs of agri/rural community in a Shariah compliant manner.
The conventional banks with Islamic Banking Branches may offer these products through
Islamic Banking Windows by using their conventional branch network.

Under the Guidelines, individuals/ partnership concerns and all types of legal entities
engaged in agriculture related activities, having sufficient knowledge and relevant experience
are eligible to get financing under the Islamic financing scheme. As per Prudential
Regulations for agriculture financing, these guidelines shall not include financing to traders
and intermediaries engaged in trading/ processing/ grading/packaging/marketing of
agricultural commodities. Such financing will fall under Corporate/ Commercial or SME
financing and will be subjected to compliance of corporate/ commercial/ SME regulations.
However, financing under the guidelines can be extended to entities ( including corporate
firms, partnerships, and individuals) engaged in farming activities as well as processing,
grading, packaging and marketing of mainly 75% of their own horticulture produce.
Financing facilities may be extended, provided IBI is satisfied with the capacity of the
customer /sponsor to manage and run the horticulture activities subject to the following
conditions:-

e Customer should be a holder of computerized NIC while usual requirements for
corporate clients would apply.
e Customer should not be a defaulter of any IBI / financial institution. This condition

IMF delegation calls on Governor SBP

A delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led by the Director Middle East and Central
Asia Department, Mr. Jihad Azour, called on the Governor State Bank of Pakistan Dr. Reza Baqir today
in Karachi. He was accompanied by the IMF Mission Chief to Pakistan, Mr. Ernesto Ramirez Rigo;
Resident Representative of IMF for Pakistan, Ms. Teresa Daban Sanchez; and Special Assistant to the
Director of the IMF’s Communications Department, Olga Stankova. The delegation also met with
senior management of the SBP.

The Governor shared SBP’s views on the economy with the IMF delegation. He noted that Pakistan
has embarked on its home-grown economic reform program and said that he looked forward to a
continuing fruitful partnership with the IMF and other stakeholders in the international financial
community to support this reform program. He observed that the transition to a market-based
exchange rate system, building foreign exchange reserves, and bringing down inflation were key
elements of the SBP’s reform program to restore financial stability and lay the foundations for
sustainable and shared growth. The initial results from the reform program were encouraging. The
earlier volatility in the exchange market and associated uncertainty had subsided and confidence was
slowly improving. Inflation had risen due to the economic imbalances accumulated from previous
years but inflationary pressures were expected to recede in the second half of the current fiscal year.
Nevertheless, the Governor emphasized that these were the early stages of the reform process and it
was essential to sustain the reform momentum and to keep policies focused on securing stability and
promoting sustainable and shared growth.

In his discussions with the SBP, Mr. Azour shared his views on how central banks in the region were
responding to the challenges being faced by them particularly with regard to capital flows, the role of
technology, and the role of central banks in economic management, amongst other areas. Mr. Azour
looked forward to a continuing partnership with the State Bank.

Financial sector should play its role in resolving

energy crisis in the country: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed upon the
financial sector to play its due role in resolving the ongoing energy crisis in the country,
which is hampering both the business activities and the life of the common man. ‘An early
resolution of this critical issue is in the interest of all, including the banking industry itself,’
he added.

Presiding over a meeting of the Chief Executives of banks at SBP, Karachi convened
for resolving the problems being faced by Independent Power Projects (IPPs), Mr. Anwar
assured the banks that the State Bank would facilitate them in case they require any
regulatory support towards early resolution of the circular debt crisis.

He pointed out that the Prime Minister’s high-powered committee is focusing on
remedial steps to develop a long term solution of the energy crisis. Mr. Anwar, however,
emphasized that a quick remedy is sought to overcome the immediate financial
requirement.

It may be recalled that the Prime Minister recently constituted a high level
committee for resolution of energy-related issues facing the country of which the Acting
Governor, SBP, Mr. Yaseen Anwar is a member.

Mr. Abdullah Yusuf Chairman, Independent Power Producers Advisory Council and
the representatives of IPPs briefed the meeting about the severity of the issue and
identified the factors behind the crisis. They informed the meeting that Government of
Pakistan (GoP) is considering various short and medium term options for resolution of the
energy crises faced by the country on a sustainable basis, which include possibilities like use
of coal as a substitute to oil, import of gas as raw material and the construction of small
hydel power projects.

During the discussions, it was emphasized that the issues being faced by the IPPs are
primarily driven by the paucity of short-term liquidity. A number of proposals were also
presented to the banks for addressing the issues including allocation of working capital
limits to PEPCO, extension of L/C time period from 60 days to 90 days for the IPPs and the
conversion of outstanding circular debt into long term Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).

While appreciating the sincerity of the GoP in early resolution of the issue, the banks
suggested that the GoP should first focus on resolution of its direct circular debt of Rs 300
billion through issuance of PIBs on priority basis, whereas financing to individual IPPs
(existing and incremental) would be taken care of by the banks individually on case-to-case
basis. They also proposed that the GoP may look into the possibility of incremental financing
through PIBs, which is considered to be more viable and would help distribute the
responsibility for financing to a larger number of banks/development finance institutions
(DFls).

HM Queen Maxima of the Netherlands felicitates Governor Wathra
on Best Central Bank Governor Award.

Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands felicitated Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mahmood
Wathra on receiving the Best Central Bank Governor Award by the Euromoney, during their meeting
in Washington DC, USA on Saturday, 8th October. Queen Maxima is also the UN Secretary-General's
Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA).

SBP Governor briefed the Queen about improvements in macroeconomic conditions in Pakistan. He
highlighted that Pakistan has successfully completed the IMF program during which a number of
critical reforms have been implemented to sustain macroeconomic stability and growth.

Governor SBP also stated that Pakistan was making steady progress towards financial inclusion goals
set in the national strategy. He shared that around 15 million digital accounts have been opened in
the country by June 2016, posting 34 percent growth in a year. Additionally, banks have achieved the
milestone of opening over one million Asaan accounts of low-risk clients in a short span of time. To
implement the national financial inclusion strategy, private sector- led Technical Committees and
working groups have been made functional to firm up action plans in different areas to increase
access and usage of financial system. Governor also briefed the Queen about recent legislative
reforms including the enactment of secured transactions law which will pay the way for the creation
of electronic registry for moveable assets in Pakistan. Moreover, credit bureau act has been passed
by the Parliament, and foreclosure laws are being strengthened. These measures will significantly
expand credit to the priority sectors.

On this occasion, Queen Maxima expressed her renewed commitment to foster financial inclusion in
Pakistan. She offered her support to help resolve impediments in expanding financial access for the
low income people. Governor thanked the Queen for her deep interest and personal involvement in
promoting financial inclusion agenda in Pakistan.

The meeting was also attended by SBP's Chief Economic Advisor, Dr. Saeed Ahmed, and UNSGA
Director, Mr. Eric Duflos.

Financial Globalization has the potential to promote and
reinforce Islamic Financial Industry: Dr. Akhtar

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the
Islamic financial services industry needs to consolidate itself to be able to better
compete with global players through achieving scale, efficiency and cost
effectiveness in addition to rapidly building its capacities to standardize regulation
and supervision and accounting practices, while strengthening the governance of
the industry.

Delivering her keynote address as the Chairperson of the Islamic Financial
Services Board (IFSB) for 2008 on ‘Financial Globalization and Islamic Financial
Services Industry’ at the 5th Annual Summit of the IFSB held in Amman, Jordan
yesterday, Dr Akhtar said that the Islamic Financial (IF) services industry has been
transformed from being a peripheral activity to a sizeable industry which is
attracting global interest.

She said that financial globalization will foster IF and given the inherent
features and richness of Islamic principles, modalities and products’ growth in IF,
will be beneficial for supporting the process of regional and global financial
deepening. Although currently the size of IF is small relative to the global
financial system, it has promising growth prospects, she added.

“Well developed and integrated Islamic money, capital, and foreign
exchange markets will not only be beneficial for borrowers and institutional
investors but can also further enhance the stability of IF institutions, providing
them with improved portfolio, liquidity and risk management tools,” Dr Akhtar
opined.

Referring to Sukuks, she said that the internationalization of the Sukuk
structure and its flotation, which is expected to hit the $100 billion mark soon, is
helping to better integrate IF with the world of global finance.. This will not only
meet the region’s massive infrastructure project financing requirement but will
also help diversify financial markets, Dr Akhtar added.

SBP Governor said that financial globalization has grown in size and scale
and there is now a broad consensus that an effectively-managed financial
globalization has the potential to benefit from and contribute to growing world
trade integration, easing of investment and cross-border capital flows as economic
liberalization gains momentum, development of interdependent production
structures, that have evolved to maximize comparative advantage, and the
revolution in information technology and institutional reforms.

However, she said the recent financial market turmoil in the subprime
mortgage market has unfolded itself in an unprecedented global liquidity crunch,

ERD/M&PRD/PR/01/2017-33 March 31, 2017

The overall economic environment continues to remain
conducive for growth, the SBP Report says.

State Bank of Pakistan has today released its Second Quarterly Report for FY17 on the State of
Pakistan’s Economy. The Report says that the overall economic environment remains conducive for
growth, on the back of accommodative monetary policy, increase in development spending, and
CPEC-inspired activities.

The Report has also noted the improvements in investors’ confidence as reflected in an uptick in
private sector credit, especially for fixed investment purposes; foreign interests in Pakistani
companies; and increased production of consumer durables. Similarly, a surge in import of
machinery and raw materials also points to a robust industrial activity and buildup of future
productive capacity.

According to the Report, the growth in Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) recovered in Q2-FY17 with
increase in production of food, cement, steel, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and electronic
industries. The growth in agricultural sector is also expected to rebound on account of higher
production of cotton, sugarcane, and maize and increased prospects for wheat harvest close to last
year after rains in early February 2017.

The Report highlights that current account deficit has almost doubled compared to the last year. This
was due to a surge in growth-inducing imports along with non-realization of CSF and decline in
exports and remittances. On an encouraging note, the Report acknowledges that the foreign inflows
— FDI, loans, and Sukuk issuance — were little more than sufficient to finance higher current account
deficit. The Report, nevertheless, highlights the need to contain current account deficit to
manageable levels to sustain external sector stability.

The Report also notes that fiscal deficit has increased due to low revenue generation amid higher
development and security related spending. While the Report terms sustained increase in
development spending commendable, it also underscores the need to enhance revenue collection.

The Report shows that average CPI inflation has risen from 2.1 percent in H1-FY16 to 3.9 percent as in
H1-FY17 which reflects higher domestic demand and an increase in global commodity prices.
However, it highlights that on year-on-year basis, the CPI inflation has fluctuated in a narrow range
during this period.

Finally, the Report perceives the growth to maintain the upward trajectory while inflation to remain
below the target during FY17.

Monetary Policy Statement
June 25, 2020

1. At its meeting on 25% June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy
rate by 100 basis points to 7 percent. This decision reflected the MPC’s view that the inflation outlook has
improved further, while the domestic economic slowdown continues and downside risks to growth have
increased. Against this backdrop of receding demand-side inflation risks, the priority of monetary policy has
appropriately shifted toward supporting growth and employment during these challenging times.

2. Consistent with its mandate, the MPC re-asserted its commitment to supporting households and
businesses through the Covid-19 crisis and minimizing damage to the economy. In this context, the MPC felt
that from a risk management point of view, a prompt response to downside risks to growth was called for
given the improved inflation outlook. In addition, the MPC noted that with approximately Rs. 3.3 trillion
worth of loans due to be repriced by early July 2020, this was an opportune moment to take action from a
monetaty policy transmission perspective. In this way, the benefits of interest rate reductions would be passed

on in a timely manner to households and businesses.

3. ‘The MPC noted that the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading in many emerging markets, including Pakistan,
and there are fears of a second wave in several other countries. The MPC observed that risks to the global
outlook are heavily skewed to the downside and the path of recovery remains uncertain. The MPC also noted
that in its update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) released yesterday, the IMF downgraded its 2020
global growth forecast further to -4.9 percent, 1.9 percentage points lower than in April, and projected a more
gradual recovery than previously anticipated.

4. Domestically, the moderation of underlying inflation has continued. Notwithstanding a seasonal uptick in
food prices associated with the Eid holiday, headline inflation declined further to 8.2 percent in May on the
back of the recent cut in diesel and petrol prices. In addition, month-on-month inflation rates continue to be
low. Recent SPI data also suggests continued moderation in overall price pressures in June, despite price

 

increases in some food items, notably wheat. The FY2020/21 budget is also expected to be neutral for
inflation as the freeze on government salaries, absence of new taxes, and lower production cost from reduced
import duties should offset the decline in subsidies in some sectors. While supply shocks could create some
volatility in inflation, the MPC felt that these are likely to be transitory given weak domestic demand, such
that monetary policy should generally look past them. Given the absence of demand-side pressures, average
inflation could fall below the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for next fiscal year. With the current
reduction of the policy rate to 7 percent, the MPC felt that real rates on a forward-looking basis (defined as
the policy rate less expected inflation) would be kept close to zero, which is appropriate under the current

circumstances.

5. On the teal side, the decline in LSM deepened to 41.9 percent (y/y) in April, when lockdowns were still
in place. In May, high-frequency indicators of activity such as cement dispatches, automobile sales, food and
textile exports, and POL sales also continued to contract, although mostly at a lower rate than in the previous
two months. Looking ahead, the economy is expected to recover gradually in FY21, supported by easing
lockdowns, supportive macroeconomic policies and a pick-up in global growth. However, risks are skewed to

Following is the text of Joint Press Release issued by Ministry of Finance and State Bank of Pakistan on
October 24, 2016 after a seminar titled “Emerging Markets in the World Economy” held in Islamabad on
October 24, 2016 wherein Ms. Christine Lagarde, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund was a
key note speaker.

Hard work and reforms are starting to pay off: says MD IMF

“This is a moment of opportunity for Pakistan, a country undergoing an economic transformation that
can place it well among the ranks of emerging market economies,’ stated Ms. Christine Lagarde,
Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. She said that given a subdued external
environment with global growth remaining too low for too long, Pakistan will need to rely on the
strength of its own policies to generate more jobs and improve living conditions. The main priorities are
to reinforce Pakistan’s economic resilience and put in place reforms for higher and more inclusive
growth.

Ms. Lagarde was addressing the seminar as the key note speaker organized by the Ministry of Finance
and State Bank of Pakistan titled, ‘Emerging Markets in the World Economy’ on 24th October in a local
hotel here in Islamabad.

Adding further, she said that costly and inefficient subsidies were reduced. ‘These subsidies
disproportionately benefited the more affluent. And the accumulation of power sector arrears, also
known as circular debt, has also significantly decreased. These are major achievements,’ she said. ‘There
have been equally important achievements on the budget revenue side. By closing tax loopholes and
setting up a more targeted approach to widen the tax base, revenue collection improved by 2 % percent
of GDP over the past three years.’ She remarked. “Indeed, the hard work and reforms are starting to pay
off. Pakistan was recently upgraded from a frontier economy to an emerging market in the MSCI index.
This is an important signal given the changing global landscape, where economic dynamism has gradually
been shifting from advanced to emerging market economies. The significant success achieved by
Pakistan in raising a $1 billion in Sukuk on a competitive pricing is also a reflection of international
investors’ confidence on what has been achieved. She urged Pakistan to continue to remain on the path
of reforms, as this is the right strategy to ward-off against any future risks.’

The Finance Minister, Senator Mohammed Ishaq Dar giving an overview of the economy and welcoming
the MD IMF said that her visit to Pakistan was an acknowledgement of the economic reform agenda
undertaken by the government during the last three years during which Pakistan has moved to the
macro-economic stability road from a position of instability, which prevailed in 2013. The major factor
which led to the successful completion of the program is the election Manifesto of April 2013 of the
Pakistan Muslim League (N), which provided a roadmap of economic reforms to be followed after

State Bank reiterates not to share personal information on fake calls

It has come to our knowledge that fraudsters are attempting to defraud the banking customers by
seeking bank account details on the pretext of biometric verification. In many cases, this is being done
through fake calls by masking the official helpline or registered numbers of banks. The receivers
apparently believe that the call is genuine or from the bank and share their personal information
including bank Account Number, ID, Password, CNIC Number, etc. resulting in loss of funds even during
the calls. The fraudsters generally impersonate as officials of State Bank of Pakistan, Army Officer or
representative of Superior Courts of law, etc. on pretext of biometric verification of accounts. In this
context, public is advised to immediately contact their banks on their registered numbers/helpline
themselves instead of responding the incoming calls and sharing their credentials.

It is informed that SBP/Banks/Micro Finance Banks do not conduct biometric verification of Banks’
existing customers through telephone calls. If public receive any such call, they may share details of
these cases/incidents with law enforcement agencies or SBP helpline at 021-111-727-273 or email at
cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk.

SBP reduces markup rate to 5 percent on refinance schemes for investment and introduces
other enhancements

Taking cognizance of the negative fallout of COVID-19 Pandemic for the economy, State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) has been constantly taking steps to safeguard the businesses and households and a
reduction in the policy rate has been a key step since March 2020. SBP has reduced the policy rate by
625 basis points since 17"" March, 2020 to 7 percent. To extend the benefits of this reduction in the
policy rate to the users of its refinance schemes, SBP has now decided to align the end user markup
rates on two of its refinance schemes for promoting investment in the country. Specifically, SBP has
curtailed the end user markup rates on Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) to 5% from the
existing 7% and on Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) for non-textile sector to 5% from 6%. Details:

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL19.htm

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL20.htm

Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF): SBP introduced this facility to provide stimulus to
the economy by supporting new investment and balancing, modernization and restructuring (BMR) of
the existing projects. To further improve the incentive under the scheme, SBP has lowered the end user
mark-up rates from existing 7% to 5%. SBP will now be providing refinance to banks at 1% with banks’
maximum margin of 4%. Further, SBP has also allowed the TERF facility in cases where LCs/Inland LCs
were opened prior, but retiring after the introduction of the scheme on March 17, 220. These
measures, in the backdrop of earlier policy action of allowing BMR under TERF, are expected to further
support the economic activity, new long term investment and employment generation. Under this
scheme, up till 2""¢ July 2020, Rs10.5 billion have been approved by banks for 21 projects.

Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF): LTFF is one of the oldest refinance schemes of SBP under which
financing is available for export-oriented projects for purchase of imported and locally manufactured
new plant and machinery. In March, 2020 SBP opened the LTFF to all sectors across the board. Earlier
the end user markup rate under this scheme were 5% for textile sector and 6% for non-textile sectors.
State Bank has now reduced its refinance rate for non-textile sector by 1% and therefore the end user
rate for all sectors across the board will be 5%.

It is expected that the above measures will help facilitate long term investment in both domestic and
export market.

SBP’s Seminar on Pakistan’s Upcoming AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on 13th November 2017 organized a ‘Compliance Forum Session’ for
guidance and awareness of financial institutions in implementation of Risk-based approach and alert
them regarding upcoming Anti Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
mutual evaluation of Pakistan. Besides presence of senior officials from supervisory departments of SBP,
relevant officers from Banks, Developments Finance Institutions (DFls), Microfinance Banks (MFBs),
Exchange Companies and Payment System Operators also participated.

The session was chaired by Executive Director - Banking Policy & Regulations Group who observed that
the AML/CFT compliance is a global phenomenon which has implications for economic and trade related
activities with rest of the world. He highlighted the importance of implementing AML/CFT regime and
need for further improvements in areas of transaction monitoring through sophisticated technology
coupled with appropriate human resources for identifying and reporting suspicious transactions under
the AML laws. He urged reporting entities to refine their efforts in risk based AML/CFT compliance and
prepare well for the upcoming AML/CFT assessment.

In his presentation, the senior officer of the SBP discussed in detail the essential elements of technical
compliance and effectiveness of FATF Recommendations in the context of upcoming AML/CFT mutual
evaluation of Pakistan. During the session, the requisite actions including preparation of statistics/
responses to FATF assessment criteria came up for discussion and it was observed that the whole
process would require dedicated efforts and seamless coordination from all AML/CFT stakeholders. The
presentation was followed by Question & Answer session.

In accordance with Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) membership rules, every member
country is required to undergo a process of Mutual Evaluation/ Assessment to determine the level of
compliance with the international AML/CFT standards. Mutual evaluation involves a desk-based review
as well as an on-site visit by a team of experts drawn from the member countries to assess a country’s
AML/CFT systems. Previously, Pakistan has undergone two mutual evaluations in 2005 & 2009 and next
mutual evaluation on FATF’s revised standards is expected to start in the first quarter of 2018.

Press Release on Workers’ Remittances

Workers’ remittances remained above $ 2.0 billion for the fifth consecutive month in October
2020.

Workers’ remittances amounted to $ 2.3 billion during October 2020, increasing by 14.1
percent compared to October 2019.

During Jul-Oct FY21, workers’ remittances increased to $9.4 billion, recording a growth of
26.5 percent over the same period last year.

A large part of y/y increase in October 2020 was sourced from Saudi Arabia (30 percent),
United States (16 percent) and United Kingdom (14.6 percent).

Improvements in Pakistan’s FX market structure and its dynamics, efforts under the Pakistan
Remittances Initiative (PRI) to formalize the flows and limited cross-border travelling
contributed to the growth in remittances.

State Bank of Pakistan whereas the loans up to USD 1 million were handled by the respective banks.
According to new instructions, the respective banks will register the FCY loans irrespective of the
amount. However, the banks will have to ensure that the FCY loans are in compliance with the relevant
laws and regulations in force.

Further, the minimum tenor of FCY loans, raised by corporate entities for working capital needs
and by the banks for liquidity management purposes, has been reduced to one month.

In order to implement these changes, Chapter 19 of Foreign Exchange Manual has been revised
and circulated vide FE Circular No 6 of 2019 dated December 17, 2019. It is expected that these
initiatives will help the corporate entities to meet their business needs and will reduce their
turnaround time in raising financing from abroad thus promoting the ease of doing business.
