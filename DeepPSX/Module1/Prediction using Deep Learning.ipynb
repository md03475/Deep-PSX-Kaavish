    "- Pandas: Pandas is the most widely used data storage and manipulation library. We import, store, process and save our data in the form of Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- SciKitLearn: SKlearn is a data preprocessing library which we would use for train test splits and data scaling.\n",

    "#### ADAM is an optimizer used to optimize the Stochastic Gradient Descent used to minimize the error the model makes. Mean Squared Error is the error or loss function used to tell the model how to minimize the error in each step. The number of epochs is defined as how many times the model would need to go through the whole data in order to reach the minimum point of the loss. We have chosen the number at which we are sure the loss becomes constant and does not drop significiantly anymore. The batch size is defined as how many training examples should it put in one batch since the parameters are adjusted after each batch."
