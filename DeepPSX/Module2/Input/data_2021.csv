B. EXTRACTS FROM THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT 70 THE MEMBERS ON REVIEW OF
CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE SIX MONTHS PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2020:

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to note 2.4 to the condensed interim financial information, which indicates that the
Company earned a net profit of Rs. 85.07 million during the six months period ended December 31, 2020
and, as of that date, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by Rs. 15.23 billion.
These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in note 2.4 indicate the existence of a material
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Ref: UNUSUAL MOVEMENT IN PRICE OR VOLUME

Dear Sir,

With reference to your letter # Gen-232 dated February 04, 2021 received at our corporate
office on February 08, 2021.

As required under Section 97 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.3 of the PSX
Regulations we state that we are not aware of any matter or development, which has not
been previously disclosed to the market through PUCARS, which may have caused unusual
movement in price or volume of Certificates of Orient rental Modaraba.

Further Orient Rental Modaraba is fully cognizant of all applicable regulatory requirements
and will always endeavor to ensure compliance of the same.

Thanking You,
Yours Sincerely,

In the current circumstances due to poor financial performance owing to COVID-19, it is unlikely that the
outstanding interest free loans of the directors would be repaid. Therefore, it will be in the interest of the
Company as well as its shareholders to reduce its liabilities which will enhance the capital base, increase
reserves without any negative impact on the cash flows.

The shares of the Company are not frequently traded and share price increased from Rs. 20.42 to Rs. 38.49
from January 01,2020 to January 28,2021 with no significant shares trading. The proposed issue price of Rs.
50/- per share including premium of Rs. 40/- per share is more than the breakup value of Rs. 45.31/- per share
as on June 30, 2020 and last share price quoted on PSX of Rs. 40.90 with no trade.

In the present situation it is unlikely that shareholders will subscribe any right offering at a premium above the
market price in view of the fact that the Company has not been able to declare any distribution to its
shareholders as dividends.

Benefits of the Issue

This will enhance the leverage and borrowing capacity of the Company thereby improving liquidity position and
improvement in the business operations and returns for the Company and value for its shareholders

Breakup Value per Share as per the Audited Financial Statements of the Company for the Year Ended
30.06.2020

Breakup value of share (Without Revaluation Surplus) Rs. 45.31 / Share
Breakup value of share (With Revaluation Surplus) Rs.112.79 / Share

Consent of the Person to whom the shares is to be issued

The Consent of the person to whom the shares are to be issued has been obtained in writing.

Ranking of the Shares

The proposed shares when issued will rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares of the Company.
Average Market Price of the Shares during the last three months

The shares of the Company are not frequently traded in the market. The average market price is Rs. 26.23
during the preceding three months from the date of Board announcement and the latest market price of share is
Rs. 40.90 as of February 09, 2021 as per closing rate at Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd (PSX).

SUBJECT: DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL INFORMATION
Dear Sir,

In accordance with Section 96 of the Securities Act 2015, and Clause 5.6.1 (a) of the Rule Book of the
Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited, we would like to convey the following material information:

In its determination to promote the health and well-being of the population of Pakistan, AGP Limited (the
“Company”) is pleased to announce that the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (‘DRAP”), on February
01, 2021, has granted Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for “Gam-COVID-Vac” combined vector
vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (“Sputnik V” or the
“Vaccine”) to the Company. The Company has also been authorized to import and introduce the Vaccine
in Pakistan and is now making efforts to ensure availability of sufficient supplies on an emergency basis
in order to play a key role in supporting the Government's objective of vaccinating the masses.

The Vaccine has been developed by the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology,
Russia, one of the world’s leading research institutions. This Vaccine has been approved by fifteen (15)
countries including Russia, Hungary, Argentina, and the United Arab Emirates with registrations underway
in several other countries. As per the Interim Clinical Study Report which is based on the Phase Ill trials
of 21,862 volunteers, the efficacy of Sputnik V has been determined at 91.6%, with 100% efficacy against
severe cases of COVID-19. The Vaccine has a good safety profile and in particular, there are no strong
allergies caused by the Vaccine. This is by far, the most effective COVID-19 vaccine to have received
EUA in Pakistan and can be administered to persons aged 18 and above, including persons aged above
60.

We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to DRAP and the Ministry of National Health Services
Regulations and Coordination, for their tireless efforts in ensuring registration of the Vaccine on a fast
track basis.

Thanks & regards

Subject: Unusual Movement in price or volume of KASB Modaraba (KASBM)
Dear Sir,

This is with reference to your letter No. PSX/ Gen-296 dated February 18, 2021 regarding the
captioned subject.

We would like to submit that the SECP vide order no. SC/M/PRDD/KASB/20129/36 dated January 31,
2020 has transferred the management rights of KASB Modaraba (KASBM) to Awwal Modaraba
Management Limited (AMML) through competitive bidding.

One of the conditions for transfer of management rights of KASBM to AMML is that AMML shall hold
and/or acquire minimum statutory holding of ten percent (10%) of the issued certificate capital of
KASBM. Therefore, in compliance of the said SECP directions, Pak Brunei Investment Company
Limited, being the holding company of the AMML, has commenced the acquisition of KASBM’s
Modaraba certificates.

As advised by you, we have reported the matter through PUCARS for information of all market
participants forthwith.

We hope that above stated facts will suffice the purpose. We assure you of strict compliance with all
necessary regulations.

Colour Coating Plants and currently any excess electricity is sold to KE.

86.79% (June 30, 2020: 83.83%) of sales of steel sheets are domestic sales whereas 13.21% (June 30,
2020: 16.17%) of sales are export / foreign sales.

Your Security ~Our Policy

5. Due to the above, not only the stakeholders of CSIL (listed company) have been denied
their rights and forced to suffer, the minority shareholders of DSL (75%) are also
suffering for years, in addition to CSIL and the syndicate of banks involving a total stake
of above 2 billion jointly between Banks and CSIL. The Mill is not in operation only due
to bad management and lack of working capital, which cannot be raised due to default
and bad management of DSL even though the value of the assets has been assessed by
independent valuator to be in the region of PKR 5 billion.

6. The Board and management of CSIL strongly believes that it had played a very active
leading role in taking our DSL from a crisis situation in 2016 and saving the stakeholders,
can still save the Company and the stakeholders (75%) plus creditors, by playing a role in
the Company before a total collapse, if CSIL is allowed to exercise its right under
contractual obligations as provided in Companies Act section 164, and effectively control
the Board by 60% and through efforts start the production and look into various options
available to provide the much needed working capital.

7. SECP as a regulator is requested to intervene and direct DSL:

i. Issue shares to CSIL against the Rs.354 million advance for issuance of shares,
DSL has received from CSIL.

ii. Provide interest for the period that shares were not issued.

ili, Implement the shareholders agreement between DSL and CSIL whereby it is
agreed that CSIL will have 60% representation on DSL board.

iv, Declare the elections held in 2020 as illegal which is in contravention of the

shareholders agreement between CSIL and DSL.
CSIL assures that it has workable proposals for the operations of the company which will save
DSL, a collapsing company to the benefit of 75% minority shareholders, financial institution,
and CSIL stakeholders.

FAIR VALUES

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in
the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit
price) regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.

The Holding Company while assessing fair values uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the

circumstances using relevant observable data as far as possible and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. Fair
values are categorized into following three levels based on the input used in the valuation techniques;

- Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be assessed at
measurement.
- Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or

liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).

- Level 3 Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability inputs for the asset or liability that are
not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

Financial assets and liabilities of the Holding Company are either short term in nature or are repriced periodically
therefore; their carrying amounts approximate their fair values.

Transfers, if any, between levels of the fair value hierarchy is recognized at the end of the reporting period during
which the transfer has occurred. The Holding Company's policy for determining when transfers between levels in the
hierarchy have occurred includes monitoring of changes in market and trading activity and changes in inputs used in
valuation techniques.

As at year end the fair value of all the financial assets and liabilities approximates to their carrying values. The
property plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment if any, except free-
hold land, lease-hold land and capital work in progress which are stated at cost. Long term investments in
subsidiaries represent the investment in unquoted shares of companies carried at cost. The Holding Company does
not expect that unobservable inputs may have significant effect on fair values.

Unity Foods Limited announced its second Right Issue on February 19, 2019. The issue
constituted 375 million shares at face value of PKR 10 each raising PKR 3,750,000,000.
At the time of announcement of Right Shares, the Company had 169,050,000 ordinary
shares and each of the then existing share was entitled to about 221.83% right shares.

The Right Issue was successfully closed as per approved schedule of PSX and the
proceeds were realized in May 2019. Thereafter, the Company issued 375 million shares.

Regulatory Requirement.

As per Regulation 18(2) of the Companies (Further Issue of Shares) Regulations, 2018,
as amended, the Company is required to submit progress report on the utilization of
proceeds of the Right Issue.

Progress Status

As the company has already informed the exchange, the acquisition of Crude Palm Oil
(CPO) refinery is complete and it is now operating at its optimal capacity. The related
asset purchase formalities of Port Qasim Authority are being processed as per Port
Qasim Authority timeline.

The process of proceed utilization of 2.4 Right issue of the Company remained slow
during the quarter under report due to the fact that the second wave of COVID-19 has
slowed down activity at the manufacturers end. However, the company remains
committed to executing its well laid down expansion plan and is endeavoring to meet the
set timelines for the expansion.

In pursuant to its strategy, in the Oct - Dec 2020 quarter, the company has opened LC
for import of equipment related to setting up of integrated oil refining process, which will
include a chemical refinery, a physical refinery and fractionation process. The company
is now expecting for the equipment to be delivered within the envisaged time schedule.

The company continues to remain engaged with suppliers of various other equipment
related to margarine and shortening plant and packaging units to acquire the same in
order to complete its expansion plan and will inform the exchange on progress as it
happens.

All in all, the overall plan relating to asset acquisition and other related activities, as per
Right Issue proceed utilization announced in February 2019 remain largely on track.

Yours truly,

694,2021-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,"There has been no significant new acquisition of assets and also no major deployment of
funds in other areas like civil construction as businesses have not fully gathered
momentum and they remained slow and were not fully geared to render the requisite
services. Therefore, no material progress in terms of deployment of funds has taken place
during October December, 2020 quarter. The proposed plan of asset acquisition remain
largely on hold. Most of the construction and other work has also either slowed down or
completely stopped during this period.

Measures to control COVID-19 that slowed or halted business activities are expected to
yield results in coming months and as soon as it is deemed beneficial for the Company
and circumstances permitting, the funds would be deployed to acquire/construct the
requisite assets. The Company expects to restart the activities as soon as overall
economic situation improves and the business environment becomes conducive towards
capitalization and expansion. The overall plan relating to asset acquisition and other
related activities, as per Right Issue proceed utilization announced in February 2019
remain largely on track.

We are hopeful that the deployment of proceeds of the 2™ right issue will be completed
as per the schedule announced with the right issue.

Sub; Progress Report
Dear Sir ’
his refers to your letter no PSX/Gen-2349 dated December 4, 2020.

n continuation of our progress report dated June 18't 2020, the management has been
exploring the options for potential investments, joint venture, / partnership etc. to
overcome the crisis being faced by the Company; however, the management could not
be able to solidify any decil owing to Covid-19 Pandemic. Therefore, the management of
he Company has held cin EOGM on April 20th 2020 to ensure the continuity of the
Company to discuss an interim solution in absence of any serious buyer / investment.

n said foresaid EOGM, the management sought approval from the shareholders under
Section 183 of the Companies Act, 2017 to lease out land & building of the Company to
meet its cash flow requirements and to utilize surplus funds towards in settling liabilities. The
decision of the shareholders resulted in generating reasonable cash flows funds upon
easing out the premises. It is pertinent to mention that the Company, after long period of
time; has earned a net prefit, although insignificant, in its first quarter ended on September
30, 2020 which will change: outlook of the Company. The management of the Company
aims to distribute profits in ihe later period as dividend.

 

The management of the Company is still looking into several options to revive the
Company and it is hoped that the Company would be able to have a positive response
by the end of the current financial year.

 

We hope the PSX would appreciate the effort of the management despite the impact of
Covid-19 and the challenging economic conditions.

The Board has further authorized the management to hold the extraordinary general meeting in due
course of time for the purposes of seeking approval from the Shareholders of the Company in respect
of the proposed transaction.

The acquisition of brands, which is subject to certain regulatory approvals and completion of certain
closing conditions, is likely to increase the market share, bring operational and logistical synergies and
enhance the product portfolio of the Company, along with increase in the Company’s revenues and
profitability (consolidated topline is expected to increase by PKR 3 Billion within twelve (12) months of
completion), improve value proposition for customers, employees and other stakeholders and in turn
maximizing shareholders’ value. The Company aims to continuously expand it in the coming years
through its concerted sales efforts, marketing penetration and strong distribution network.

Subject: Material Information
Dear Sir,

In accordance with Section 96 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) (xv)
of PSX Regulations, We hereby convey the following information:

PTCL's License Renewal

Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (“PTCL”) integrated license was
issued for 25 years effective from 1st January, 1996 and valid until 31st December,
2020; therefore-subsequent renewal was required effective 1st January 2021. As
per terms of PTCL license, PTCL initiated the renewal process by formally
requesting Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (“PTA”) on 29 June, 2018 (30
months prior to the expiry/validity of the License). PTA responded in affirmative
vide its letter dated 1st October, 2018 that PTCL’s license will be renewed in
accordance the Government Policy prevalent at the time of renewal.

Therefore, in the interest of business continuity and operations, PTCL has sought
permanent injunction on 18 December, 2020 from the Sindh High Court at
Karachi by way of filing Suit No 2081/2020 wherein PTA is restrained from taking
any adverse action against PTCL on expiry of license on 31st December, 2020 and
not to interfere in the business of PTCL and the provision of services on the basis
of license.

PTCL, however, remains in discussions with PTA and the Federal Government to
finalize the terms and conditions of the renewed license. PTCL is confident that
license will be renewed at the earliest.

Yours Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Re: Company’s response under PSX Regulation 5.6.2 to information circulating on WhatsApp
Groups

The Company wishes to draw the attention of Exchange to false information circulating on WhatsApp
groups stating that Byco Petroleum has started production from two units (Diesel Hydro De-
Sulphurising Unit and Fluid Cracking Unit) with the facilitation of its subsidiary Byco Industries
Incorporated.

Pursuant to Regulation 5.6.2 of the PSX Rule Book, the Company strongly denies the accuracy of the
information stated in above WhatsApp circulation and makes is clear that it does not reflect the factual
position on the matter. As disclosed at its Extraordinary General Meeting held in 2™ April 2020, that as
part of its Upgrade Project, Byco Petroleum Pakistan Limited would install Fluid Catalytic Cracking
(“FCC”) unit along with its associated plants for cracking of furnace oil into Gasoline and Diesel and
a Diesel Hydro Desulfurization (‘DHDS”) unit for removal of Sulfur from Diesel. The Company has
already made progress on the project as per the schedule. A Ground Breaking ceremony was held on
Saturday, January 09, 2021 to commence civil construction of the Project.

We further clarify that the Company, its sponsors, major shareholders and directors have no connection
to the above cited false WhatsApp circulation which has apparently caused unexpected rally in
Company’s shares traded on the PSX.

We expect the above clarifies the matter. You may inform the TRE Certificate-holders of the Exchange
accordingly.

Subject: Meeting other than financial results

In accordance with Section 96 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) of the Pakistan Stock
Exchange Limited Regulations, Ferozsons Laboratories Limited (the ""Company"") conveys the following
information relating to emergent board meeting held on January 19, 2021.

BF Biosciences Limited (""BFBL""), a 80% owned subsidiary of the Company intends to install a second
manufacturing line to cater the production of biologicals and non-biologicals injectables products (both
liquid and lyophilized). BFBL has finalized negotiations with the supplier to purchase the manufacturing
line and has also secured firm financing approvals from financial institutions. However, being a relatively
young pharmaceutical company, the financial institutions have required the corporate guarantee and
charge on assets of the Company, for which the BFBL has requested the Company to extend its support.

In its meeting held on January 19, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company has considered and
approved the request of BFBL for extending corporate guarantee and charge on assets and the same is
recommended for shareholders’ approval in the upcoming Extra-Ordinary General Meeting.

You may inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly.

(PMI)

Dear Sir,

This is with reference to your notice No. PSX/ N-68 dated January 20, 2021 regarding the
captioned subject.

We would like to submit that the SECP vide order no. SC/M/PRDD/KASB/20129/36 dated
January 31, 2020 has transferred the management rights of First Prudential Modaraba
(PMI) to Awwal Modaraba Management Limited (AMML) through competitive bidding.

One of the conditions for transfer of management rights of PMI to AMML is that AMML
shall hold and/or acquire minimum statutory holding of ten percent (10%) of the issued
certificate capital of PMI. Therefore, in compliance of the said SECP directions, Pak Brunei

Investment Company Limited, being the holding company of the AMML, has commenced
the acquisition of PMI’s modaraba certificates.

We hope that above stated facts will suffice the purpose. We assure you of strict
compliance with all necessary regulations.

Regards;

Wo
Misbah Wahid
Company Secretary

Dear Sir,

We refer to your letter No. dated January 20, 2021 on the captioned subject and wish to state that
since company has no control over the day to day movement in Pakistan Stack Exchange, therefore
we are unaware about the huge trading in mid-January 2021 period. We have contacted our registrar
regarding the huge transaction in January, 2021 and they informed us that they have no knowledge
of daily trading in PSX and CDC transaction data is shifted to us on monthly basis and not daily
basis. They wil! be able to inform you in the 15 week of February, 2021. However, on behalf of
company I wish to inform you that Directors/ Sponsors did not trade any shares in January, 2021.

Thanking you

Dear Sirs,

MATERIAL INFORMATION — INSTALLATION OF FOURTH POLYPROPYLENE LINE

 

In view of rising demand for polypropylene bags produced by the Company, the Board of Directors
of Cherat Packaging Limited in its meeting held on January 5, 2021 has decided to enhance its
production capacity by installing its fourth Polypropylene line for woven bags. The Company has
once again decided to acquire the plant from M/s. Windmoller & Holscher, which is the leading
supplier of such equipment. The plant, which is the fastest and the most efficient equipment of its
kind, will have a production capacity of approximately 65 million bags per annum. It will be
installed at the existing site in Gadoon Amazai, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Addition of this
plant will take the total production capacity of the Polypropylene Division to 260 million bags per
annum. The total cost of the project is approximately Rs. 1.10 billion and it is expected to be
commissioned by December 31, 2021. The project will principally be financed through a long-term
loan.

PSX is requested to disseminate the information to the TRE Certificate Holders.

Yours sincerely,
For Cherat Packaging Limited

Particulars of the Asset

 

** Approximate Fair Value /

Date of Acquisition
id Current Market Value

Description of Asset Cost

 

Freehold agriculture land measuring 265 Acres and
25 Ghuntas located at Deh Kalo Khokar, Taluka
Thano Bula Khan, District Jamshooro, Sindh and 2005 10,276,104 PKR 489,000,000.00
Leasehold industrial land measuring 1 Acre situated
at Plot No. D/45, SITE, Nooriabad, Sindh.

* The exact date of acquisition of the land as per fixed assets register has been kept at the registered office of the company which can
be inspected by the shareholders from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on any working day, upto the last working day before the EOGM.

** The independent valuation of the asset has been conducted by the surveyors & valuers M/s Joseph Lobo (Pvt) Ltd on January 1,
2021.

The land was acquired way back in the year 2005 and it is highly probable that the sale price will be much higher than the cost

of asset.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Proposed manner of sale
The land will be disposed through negotiations with the buyers through persons authorized by the board of directors in a way that is most
beneficial for the shareholders and the company.

Purpose of the sale
As in near future there has been no consideration for expansion plan in the province of Sindh, the board of directors have decided to
sell the land.

Utilization of proceeds
The proceeds will be utilized for running and managing the working capital requirements of newly established finishing unit in
Sheikhupura Punjab.

Impact of sale on the operations of the company
There will be no impact on business as no economic activity has not been carried out on this land.
Quantitative and qualitative benefits expected to accrue to the members

The utilization of the proceeds from sale of land for the newly established finishing will result in lesser borrowing by the banks. This
will eventually led to better financial performance by the company and enhancing the shareholders’ value.

Expected time of completion of the transaction

It is expected that transaction will be completed by March 2021.

Undertaking by the directors

The board of directors have carried out necessary due diligence for the proposed transaction.

Note: There has been typographical error in earlier notice for the current market fair / value which was erroneously written
“PKR 489,000,00.00” and highly regretted by us. The same has been rectified for circulation and the current market value

should be read as “PKR 489,000,000.00”. The publication in newspaper and circulation of notice to shareholders have been
made correctly.
