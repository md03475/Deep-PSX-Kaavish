SBP GOVERNOR, DR. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR DESCRIBES
BASEL II AS A REVOLUTION IN RISK MANAGEMENT.

Addressing the 56"" Annual General Meeting of the Institute of Bankers Pakistan today,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, gave a comprehensive briefing on the theory
and practical dimensions and elements of Basel II. She termed Basel II as a “revolution” in regulation
and risk management, while pointing out that it is not just the banks which will change in the Basel II
scenario, this accord will also affect rating agencies, external auditors, banks’ customers and
regulators alike.

Dr. Akhtar said that the main element underlying the Basel II framework is the recognition
and management of risk. ‘One cannot dispute the inevitability of effective recognition and proper risk
capital weightage of different types of risks in bank operations in the current financial architecture’,
the Governor noted. In her speech, Dr. Akhtar discussed in detail some of the key challenges
pertaining to the implementation of the Basel II Accord, namely, a) Reliability of Risk Management
systems, 2) Asymmetry in Supervision, 3) Imperfect Markets, 4) Pro-cyclicality, 5) Access to Finance
for the disadvantaged sectors, 6) Need for development of risk management expertise, 7) Operational
costs and 8) Cross-border challenges.

Dr. Akhtar laid great emphasis on the access to finance for all sections of society. Keeping in
view the fact that the new accord would require banks to hold higher capital allocation for assuming
higher credit risk, she highlighted the potential concern that small businesses and poor segments of
the society might receive negligible or very costly credit under the new regime. Even under the old
framework, the problem of access to finance for low income segments is quite significant for
developing countries. She emphasized that this issue is closely linked to the poverty alleviation efforts
of the government, and cannot be addressed in isolation. However, she said, policies should be made
to bring more segments in the ambit of financial services without seriously compromising the banks’
risk profile. As a regulator the SBP may need to look into the possibility of designing a modified risk
assessment system for the development finance activities of banks.

The SBP Governor said that in her view, the foremost challenge facing banks in Pakistan, as
well as across the region, is to develop well-functioning, efficient and integrated risk-management
systems. Banks in Pakistan in particular, have become more cautious in their credit appraisal and
monitoring system, however the risk management expertise of the entire banking sector needs to be
improved further in order to meet the challenge imposed by Basel II.

She elaborated that the entire framework is based on reliability of good quality data to assess
risks accurately. Banks have to rely on External Credit Rating Institutions (ECRIs) which in turn have
considerable reliance on external auditors of the borrowing entity. State Bank has taken various
measures to ensure that the quality of ECRIs and External Auditors.

Dr. Akhtar said that some important steps towards achieving an effective implementation of
Basel II include a) concerted capacity building measures for the training of human resources in
targeted fields, b) developing internal risk models and advanced risk management systems at SBP, c)
enhanced coordination with SECP over issues arising out of Basel II implementation, and d)
maintaining regular contact with banks in order to evaluate their compliance and provide guidance
wherever necessary.

The Central Bank has chalked out a roadmap for the implementation of Basel II accord in a
phased manner. ‘SBP has to ensure that the implementation is achieved in a smooth manner’, the
Governor added. ‘The transitional period is expected to provide the banks the requisite time to fine
tune their systems and hone their technical and human resource capabilities’.

State Bank to issue Rs.5000/- and New Rs.10/- Banknotes
from 27"" May, 2006: Governor

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar has announced the
launching of Rs.5000/- and new Rs.10/- banknotes from tomorrow. She said that all the
field offices of SBP Banking Services Corporation throughout the country would issue
these notes with effect from 27"" May, 2006.

Addressing a press conference at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this
afternoon, the Governor said that it is for the first time in the history of the country that
the banknote of Rs.5000/- denomination is being introduced. She said the main benefit of
introducing Rs.5000/- banknote was to provide convenience and facilitate higher value
transactions. Issuance of larger denominated note also economises the expenditure on
printing of notes as higher denomination notes would reduce the consumption of lower
denomination notes.

Dr. Akhtar said the Government of Pakistan and the State Bank had decided to
issue new designed banknotes with high-tech security features to minimize the possibility
of counterfeiting of these notes.

She said that Rs.5000/- banknote contains several security features of
international standards and now our notes are comparable with Euro and have more
security features than US dollars. ‘The note also contains a special security feature to
facilitate the visually impaired persons to easily recognize it’, Dr. Akhtar added.

The Governor said that the new designed Rs.10/- banknote also contained a host
of security features as compared to the existing Rs.10/- note.

She said the new notes also depict the architectural heritage of the country.
Famous monumental structures of Pakistan — the Khyber Pass, Peshawar, Mohen-jo-
Daro, Larkana and Faisal Mosque, Islamabad — have been printed as the vignette at the
reverse of Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.5000 banknotes respectively, the Governor added.

With a view to facilitate the handling of new notes, their size has been kept
smaller than the existing notes. The width of the new banknotes is 65mm as against
73mm of the existing banknotes while the length of new banknotes has also been kept
smaller than the existing ones, Dr. Akhtar added.

Dr. Akhtar said that the designs of all the existing banknotes would be changed.
She said that the new designed Rs.20/- banknote was being issued from 13"" August,

SBP GOVERNOR MEETS APTMA

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar met the representatives
of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association and other Associations of Textile Sector to
exchange views on problems facing the Textile Industry at SBP, Karachi today. The textile
exporters requested for subsidization and flexibility in the two key schemes being offered by
SBP i.e. i) Export Finance Scheme ii) Long-Term Financing Scheme for Export Oriented
Projects (LTF-EOP).

Representatives of the textile sector apprised the Governor, SBP of their current
financial problems, particularly due to high interest rates and utility prices etc, and said that
their products have become uncompetitive in the world market. They have requested the
Governor for financial relief by reducing the refinance rate under SBP’s Export Finance
Scheme and Swap of their existing loans which were obtained from commercial banks on
KIBOR based lending rates through financing under SBP’s LTF-EOP Scheme. Additionally
they also demanded allocation of sufficient limits to the banks for meeting the growing
demand of the export oriented projects under LTF-EOP Scheme.

Sympathizing with the textile exporters, Governor SBP underscored the need for
textile industry to position themselves more effectively to deal with the growing and
aggressive regional and global competition. Rather than rely on temporary financial support
which is fiscally not sustainable on a long term basis and carries the risk of monetary
complications, Pakistan’s textile industry should upfront assess their project viability based
on alternate scenario’s. She elaborated that subsidization of either interest rate and expansion
of refinancing not only creates distortions and complications for monetary expansion, but
based on past experience are prone to misuse and exploitation. While the SBP tight monetary
policy has helped eased somewhat inflationary pressures, any further pressures on budget and
on reserve money via an expansion of refinancing scheme will generate additional
inflationary pressures which can then only be controlled by raising further interest rates.

While assuring the industry that the SBP is sympathetic to current problems of
industry, she concluded that more consultation is required with the Government to ultimately
decide on export refinance scheme and more analysis is needed to assess the financial
implications of the swap scheme being requested. In any case, she indicated that textile
community should understand that any subsidies associated will be limited and time bound
given the fiscal constraints. In response to a question, she strongly rejected any demand for
easing of prudential regulations in case of defaults. She indicated that both borrowers and
financial institutions have to remain within the defined prudential parameters defined by
SBP.

The meeting was attended among others by the Deputy Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan, Mr. Mansur-ur-Rehman Khan, senior Executive and officials of the Bank and 11

representative bodies of textile sector, besides APTMA.

STATE BANK INVITES FEEDBACK ON DRAFT
GUIDELINES FOR FISHERIES FINANCING

The State Bank of Pakistan has formulated Draft Guidelines for fisheries
financing. These guidelines are aimed at increasing the flow of credit to fisheries
sector that promises rich returns to the fishermen, banks and the economy as a
whole; ensuring enhanced and sustained access of affordable financial services to
fisheries sector, attracting investment in infrastructure and fish processing units,
thereby substantially increasing fish catch both from marine as well as from fresh
waters and also by encouraging pond fish production.

great potential and can play a significant role in the national economy by contributing
towards food security of the country and reducing pressure on demand for mutton, beef
and poultry.

Facilitation of Home Remittances to Pakistan

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar chaired a meeting of
Heads of Commercial Banks at SBP, Karachi today to discuss the issues related to
transmission of funds from overseas Pakistanis to their families back home. In her
opening remarks, the Governor underscored to the participants that the facilitation of
cheap, safe and speedy transmission of funds from overseas Pakistanis to their
families is on the active agenda of the Government and State Bank of Pakistan. The
movement of funds through informal channels represents both a loss of revenue for
financial services providers, and a welfare loss for remitters who are forced to send
money home via risky, costly and otherwise inefficient remittance channels. The
formalization of this market would be both pro-poor and welfare enhancing for the
economy as a whole.

She further cited the examples of various other labour-sending countries like
Philippines where through a joint effort of public and private sector, the overseas
migrants have been phenomenally facilitated in transmission of their incomes back to
their families.

The participants were given a brief presentation by Exchange Policy Department
of State Bank on recent international efforts and practices being followed by banks in
various other developing countries to facilitate the flow of remittances. In turn, the
Heads of Commercial Banks apprised the Governor about the problems they face in
overseas jurisdictions in providing remittance services to overseas Pakistanis. Some
of the participants also highlighted the need for media campaign to inform the
overseas Pakistanis about the remittance services being offered by commercial banks
of Pakistan.

In her concluding remarks, the Governor State Bank advised the banks to increase
their level of commitment and interest in provision of remittance related services to
overseas Pakistanis and their families. In this respect, she instructed banks to establish
‘Home Remittances Cell’ with dedicated professional personnel including IT experts
and submit to State Bank their annual strategic plan for mobilization of remittances
within four weeks. She also formed a committee headed by President, Habib Bank
Ltd, to interface with other commercial banks in order to ensure swift delivery of
their strategic plans. The State Bank will coordinate with commercial banks closely
and provide the required advice and support to complete their plans to mobilize
additional remittance. At the end, she assured the banks of State Bank’s active
support in discharging the national responsibility of facilitating the remittances by
overseas Pakistanis.

liberalization in the form of Preferential Trade Agreements. She emphasized that the
Pakistan has a road map for further deepening of reforms and addressing any policy,
legal and regulatory distortions which would ensure the continuation of recent strong
economic performance well into future.

She pointed out that Pakistan’s export structure in terms of share of value
added goods, both in the textile and non-textile sectors, has improved. However, she
also stressed that there is a further room for improvement. She also emphasized on the
importance of diversifying the international export markets of Pakistani products.

The Governor told the conference participants that the effectiveness of macro
economic reforms and the trade policies at the micro level (on firms operating in the
economy) is linked to strengthening of export competitiveness. However, a host of
other factors also impact competitiveness such as: a good business environment;
comparative advantage which a country has in various sectors; elimination of anti
export bias due to preference given to import substitution policies; and whether the
firms can actually combine the various factor inputs in a sophisticated and efficient
manner to come out with high quality products.

ALL COMMERICAL BANKS TO INTRODUCE BASIC
BANKING ACCOUNTS FROM 1st MARCH, 2006

All commercial banks operating in Pakistan will introduce the Basic Banking
Accounts (BBA) facility from 1 March, 2006. This was decided at a meeting of the
Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) held under the chairmanship of the Governor, State
Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar at SBP, Karachi today.

The Basic Banking Accounts facility has the following features:

— The minimum initial deposit will be Rs 1000.

— Will be non-remunerative account.

— No limit on minimum balance. In cases, where balance in BBA remains
‘nil’ for a continuous six-month period, such accounts will be closed.

— No fee for maintaining BBA.

— Maximum two deposit transactions and two chequing withdrawals are
allowed, free of charge, through cash/clearing per month.

— Unlimited, free of charge, ATM withdrawals from the banks’ own
ATMs. In case of withdrawal from BBA through the ATM machines of
other banks, the respective/other bank may recover charges for such
transactions.

— For the existing banking accounts, banks may get the consent of all their
customers whether they wish to maintain a BBA with them or a regular
full service banking account with its accompanying terms and
conditions. In case an account holder does not give his/her consent for a
BBA, his/her account will be treated as a regular full service banking
account.

— Statement of account will be issued once in a year.

It was decided in the meeting that the banks will disclose prominently as to
whether the credit extended by them is on fixed or on floating basis. Banks will print
in bold letters their mark up rates, wherever disclosed, on their forms and
advertisements for the benefit of the customers.

The meeting also decided that banks must inform their customers about the
insurance premium being charged by them on credit cards/ATMs. It was emphasized
by the State Bank that the banks can charge insurance premium only with the written
consent of their customers. The meeting decided to switch over to the new system of
reporting to the CIB as quickly as possible.

The Governor informed the meeting that the technical work on Real Time Gross
Settlement (RTGS) System was advancing steadily. It needs to be accelerated, she
added. The trial run of the system would commence by the middle of this year. She

ADVANCES AGAINST SUGAR: SBP EXTENDS
DEADLINE UPTO 315"" OCTOBER, 2006

The State Bank of Pakistan has extended the deadline of adjusting advances
against the security of sugar stocks upto 31 October, 2006. However, this extension
will only be applicable to such financing facilities whose expiry date is after 31% July,
2006.

A decision to this effect was taken by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar who chaired two separate meetings of the Chief Executives of
banks/DFIs and a delegation of Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) at SBP
Karachi today.

Both the banks and the PSMA pointed out to the SBP Governor that the Sugar
Mills had not been able to liquidate their advances till 31 July, 2006 due to a number
of problems being faced by the millers. They said that as per normal cycle loans
against sugar are generally repaid by October every year

The PSMA delegation welcomed the decision of the Governor for extending
the deadline. The delegation assured the Governor that the advances against sugar
stocks would definitely be liquidated by the extended deadline.

The Governor asked the banks/DFls to reduce their loans by 1/3""? every month
to ensure full adjustment of their advances against the security of sugar stocks by the
extended deadline i.e. 31 October, 2006. She said the progress in this respect will be
closely monitored by the State Bank through the weekly statements which banks/DFIs
would submit to it (SBP).

The Governor also allowed the banks/DFIs to extend financing facilities
against the securities of imported sugar without 50% cash margin requirement. But
she pointed out that such financing should be adjusted within 45 days of the
disbursement of funds.

BPD Circular No.10 dated 31"" July, 2006 issued in this regard to the

presidents/chief executives of all banks is enclosed.

STATE BANK’S INITIATIVES FOR THE PROMOTION OF EXPORTS

In an effort to support the country’s major export sector, SBP has been implementing few

incentives to the sector offered both by SBP and the Government. This has involved reduction in

refinance rates under Export Finance Scheme (EFS), debt swap option under rates and the Long

Term Finance Scheme for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP), and Research & Development

support. The initiatives have significant industry wide implications for sustaining export

momentum with the following encouraging results:

()

(ii)

(iii)

Export refinance of Rs 137.91 billion was released to banks during the period July
01, 2006 to 18"" November 2006 as against Rs 120 billion released during the same
period last year. Refinance under EFS is being offered at 6.5% i.e., 4-4.5% below 6-
month KIBOR and has so far resulted in a positive impact of Rs. 1.07 billion during

July-November 2006 for the export sector.

Pursuant to the announcement of the debt swap option under LTF-EOP, SBP has
provided refinance of about Rs 13.86 billion through commercial banks against 107
cases to the value added Textile industry in particular and six sub sectors of the
spinning sector in general. Over & above this, the industry has availed Rs 8.40 billion
under the Scheme for new projects. In aggregate, so far, more than Rs. 22 billion
refinance has been released under this scheme to commercial banks, since its
inception to 2nd December 2006.

Under Research and Development Support (R&D) scheme, all offices of SBP BSC
across the country have cumulatively released Rs 8.8 billion and cleared about
79,000 cases since July 2005. During July-October 2006 alone they processed

20,170 cases involving release of approx. Rs 2.7 billion.

With the above incentives, the industry was expected to rationalize its cost structure and

consequently increase exports. However, it is disappointing to note that exports of the sector

have shown negative growth for the current fiscal year (Jul-Oct 2006) as compared to an increase

of 30% during the corresponding period last year.

Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association delegation
holds meeting with Governor, State Bank of Pakistan

A five-member delegation of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association (PBEA)
led by its Chairman, Mr. Shabir Ahmed met the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar at SBP, Karachi today.

The delegation while highlighting the performance of the Association apprised the
Governor of exporters’ concern over the increased cost of financing, which is rendering
the sector non-competitive in comparison to other regional suppliers especially to the
US/EU market. The group proposed a rebate on interest rate for Bedwear Exporters
Association and indicated that India was offering such a facility to its exporters. It
presented a study of Bangladesh and Pakistan bedwear industry.

The SBP Governor pointed out that first, on an overall basis, the export growth
has been quite robust given the support of export refinance and other measures. Second,
the interest cost is one component of the overall cost structure of exports and there are
industry and infrastructure specific constraints, which have more implications of export
competitiveness. Third, the interest rates have been high largely because of the continued
inflationary pressure that stems from a number of factors. From the central bank’s
perspective, we need to continue monitoring the situation, she added.

She emphasized that while broader macro-economic objectives of containment of
inflation are important for the overall growth of the economy, the sector must also
evaluate its own competitiveness/efficiency and strives to find answers to compete with

regional market players with a long term perspective.

STATE BANK RELEASES ITS ANNUAL REPORT
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2005-2006

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its Annual Report for the fiscal year
2005-06. The Report is in two volumes. Volume-I of the Report contains a
comprehensive review of Pakistan’s economy during the year 2005-06 while Volume
II deals with the performance of the State Bank itself. The Volume-II also contains
the balance sheets of the State Bank and its subsidiaries.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar briefed the newsmen
about the salient features of the Report at a press conference held at Karachi this
morning. The following are the highlights of the Report.

HIGHLIGHTS OF STATE BANK’S ANNUAL REPORT 2005-06

1. Pakistan’s economy turned in a strong performance for yet another year in FY06 with
real GDP growth of 6.6 percent remaining higher than the desired long-term average of 6
percent. This was supported by strong growth in exports and private investment and
probably contributed to a further reduction in poverty. The sustained high growth is quite
creditable given the many adverse developments, such as very sharp increase in oil
prices, and the October 2005 earthquake.

2. For the first time in six years, the expansion in broad money (M2) was lower than the
nominal growth of the economy, i.e. the pace of money creation was lower than the
generation of goods and services in the economy. The monetary tightening, coupled with
administrative actions by the government to lower food inflation, helped contain average
CPI inflation within the 8 percent annual target, without prejudice to the country’s long-
term growth momentum.

3. There are however some areas of concern, in particular due to (i) a relatively narrow
growth base, (ii) persisting high inflation, (iii) pressures in fiscal deficit in the backdrop
of a nearly stagnant tax base which has kept the tax/GDP ratio in the 10 to 11 percent
range for over a decade, and (iv) widening of the current account deficit.

4. The policy environment for FY07 is even more challenging as monetary policy is
required to support both a lower inflation target of 6.5 percent in FY07 as well as a higher
real GDP growth. SBP projections suggest that real GDP growth is likely to be close to
the 7 percent annual target in FY07, helped by a recovery in agriculture and industry as
well as yet another robust performance by the services sector.

5. The expansionary fiscal policy in FY07 has compounded the risks to the economy.
Besides adding to inflationary pressures, the Government’s higher funding requirement

OVER 7,200 BANKS’? BRANCHES TO COLLECT UTILITY BILLS

Over 7,200 branches of all the scheduled banks operating in the country will
collect utility bills from the consumers. This was decided at a meeting of the chief
executives of banks and utility companies held under the chairmanship of the Governor,
State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar in Karachi today.

The utility companies and the banks will inform the general public through an
aggressive media campaign that now all commercial banks’ branches will accept the
utility bills. The meeting also decided a thorny issue of service charges between the
banks and the utility companies regarding the collection of utility bills which has been
pending since 1997. It was agreed in the meeting that the utility companies will pay
service charges to banks for rendering the services of collection of utility bills for which a
separate service level agreement will be signed between the bank and the utility
company.

It was also decided in the meeting that all banks will provide facility of drinking
water and sheds at their branches for the benefit of the consumers in accordance with the
municipal laws. The State Bank of Pakistan will carry out regular inspection and surprise
checks of banks’ branches to ensure that the public are being provided these facilities so
that they should not face any difficulty in depositing their utility bills. The State Bank
will impose fines if any bank is found guilty of not providing the above facilities at their

branches.

PRESIDENT’s VISIT TO STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

President General Pervez Musharraf visited the State Bank head-quarters in Karachi this morning
to seek a briefing from the Governor, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar. This was his first visit to the State
Bank since the Governor took charge on January 2"", 2006.

During his visit, the President shared his views with the SBP top management officials, on the
strong economic performance of the country. While commenting on macroeconomic stability, he
stressed that the gains to the economy will only be meaningful when they are translated into a
better life for the common man. He said that sustained economic growth can alleviate poverty in
the country through an enhanced access to the poor to microfinance, agriculture credit and SME
finance.

Commenting on the high trade deficit, he talked about the enhanced prospects of increasing the
country’s export earnings to US $ 18 billion in order to reduce the trade deficit. He indicated that
the tax revenue collections are set to exceed the target of Rs 800 billion by the end of this fiscal
year to reach Rs 850 billion, though he recognized that there is a need to further strengthen the
tax to GDP ratio.

While giving her views on State Bank’s future vision and strategy in the briefing to the President,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar mentioned that the State Bank of Pakistan is well on its way to
implementing second-generation reforms both in the financial sector, and within SBP, in terms of
strengthening governance standards and modernizing it in line with international best practices.

In her presentation, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar covered the areas of monetary policy, management of
foreign exchange reserves, commercial banks’ profitability, improved access to underserved
markets to development finance, promotion of financial robustness and stability, development of
electronic banking and information technology and the need to continue to strengthen governance
issues within the central bank.

The Governor laid great emphasis on the fact that the State Bank, in its efforts to strike a balance
between its dual objectives of controlling inflation and promoting economic growth, works in
close alliance with the macroeconomic goals of the Government.

While highlighting the process of formulation and implementation of monetary policy, Dr. Akhtar
pointed out that the tightening stance of recent months has largely been effective in bringing
inflation down, and that the central bank will continue to monitor liquidity conditions in the
market very closely in order to keep inflation in check. She also mentioned that the conduct of
monetary policy tends to be quite complicated when the money supply grows at a pace faster than
nominal GDP as this gives rise to inflationary pressures, and in doing so the contribution of
government borrowing from the central bank has a major role to play, and needs to be checked.

When talking about Commercial Banks’ profitability, the Governor pointed out that 80% of the
banking sector now belongs to the private sector, and that commercial banks have had record
profits during 2005, which emanates from improved management of the banking sector, though it

Task Force on Issuance of Islamic Liquidity Management Instruments

The first meeting of the Task Force set up by the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar to map out a plan for introducing short term and medium
term liquidity management products based on innovative Islamic structures that would
enable Islamic banking institutions in Pakistan to manage liquidity matters was held at
SBP, Karachi today.

The meeting presided over by Mr. Pervez Said, Director, Islamic Banking
Department, State Bank of Pakistan, was attended by members of the Task Force, which
include bankers from various leading banks involved in Islamic banking operations.

The terms of reference formulated by the State Bank of Pakistan for the Task
Force were discussed thoroughly with the participants. Terms of Reference included the
structuring of Islamic instruments for short term liquidity management, comparative
study of such Islamic instruments issued by other countries, practices of Institutions
offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS) in meeting Statutory Liquidity Requirement
(SLR) by central banks, structuring of Shariah compliant instruments for money market
operations, introduction of Islamic instruments using securitization techniques,
examination of these instruments from regulatory, legal and operational requirements,
preparation of recommendations on modes and methods for issuance of these
instruments, reporting mechanism of these instruments, identifying instruments which
can be used by the Government of Pakistan, etc.

It was decided in the meeting that timelines will be set for achieving the various
objectives and goals of the Task Force and the activities will be carried out in a phased
manner. In the first phase, three sub-groups have been formed to work on product design,
treasury issues and operational & legal issues. The meeting decided that in the first phase,
focus will be on structuring short term instruments to meet the liquidity requirements of
banks. It was also decided that the process of development and structuring of these
instruments should be done at a rapid pace.

The State Bank of Pakistan assured the bankers that it would provide support for
devising these Islamic instruments which will immensely help the Islamic banks to

resolve their liquidity problems.

Exchange rate likely to remain stable in inter-bank market

SBP computations indicate that there is no fundamental misalignment of the real effective
exchange rate of the rupee and therefore, consistent with recent trends, the exchange rate
will remain stable in the inter-bank market. The SBP believes that stability in the
exchange rate has proved to be, and will remain, important to ensure macroeconomic
stability and to attract investment in the country.

This view is based on the substantial improvement in the country’s economic

performance and better investment climate. This has boosted investor confidence (leading
to higher non-debt creating flows into the economy, including remittances and FDI) as
well as the country’s ability to borrow from international markets at relatively favorable
terms. As a result, Pakistan’s external financing prospects will remain favorable for
several years. This is also acknowledged in the recent IMF Report on Article IV
Consultations with Pakistan in 2006.

Consistent with its stance, the SBP believes that it is important for macroeconomic
stability to contain excessive demand growth in the economy, and therefore remains
committed to maintaining a tight monetary posture. A decline in domestic inflation,
consequent to the tight monetary policy, will be crucial in improving the competitiveness
of Pakistan’s exports and reducing current account imbalances.

STATE BANK GOVERNOR CHAIRS JOINT MEETING OF PBA-SBP

A joint meeting of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Pakistan Banks’
Association, which was held under the chairmanship of SBP Governor, Dr. Shamshad
Akhtar in Karachi today, took some important decisions for the benefit of the general
public/account holders.

It was decided in the meeting that the banks will simplify the terms and conditions
on account opening forms. The banks will not only publish these conditions in larger font
but also in Urdu language for removing the grievances of the public.

To create awareness among the general public about the new system of reporting
to the Credit Information Bureau, the State Bank and the PBA will publish
advertisements in the press.

The meeting was informed that 3,424 branches were providing real time online
banking facility to the account holders as against 7,242 branches of 41 banks operating in
the country which means that 47.27% branches are online branches. It was emphasized in
the meeting that the volume and value of online banking transactions should be enhanced.

The PBA expressed its concern over the imposition of central excise duty on
services and increase in withholding tax on cash withdrawals in the Federal Budget 2006-

surcharge on income may be levied through income tax on the identified services in the
Finance Bill 2006-07.

The PBA has assured the State Bank that the banks would try their level best to
sparingly use the SBP discount window. The PBA also assured the State Bank that there
would be no delay in reporting of forex and money market transactions by banks to SBP

The Governor has asked the PBA to ensure that the banks should prominently
disclose their lending and deposit rates. She also asked the PBA to impress upon the
banks to recover their advances to discourage hoarding of sugar.

The meeting was attended, among others, by the Deputy Governor, Mr. Tawfiq A.

CORE INFLATION DECLINES TO 5.6 PER CENT INNOVEMBER, 2006

The core inflation, measured both as non-food non-energy (NFNE) and 20 percent
trimmed mean, declined in November to 5.6 percent and 6.1 percent respectively compared with
7.6 percent and 6.8 percent in the corresponding month last year, according to the State Bank’s
monthly publication titled ‘ Inflation Monitor’ released on its website today.

The Inflation Monitor says that the headline inflation in November 2006 persisted at its
previous month rate of 8.1 percent with a slight rise in food inflation that was counterbalanced by
a decline in non-food inflation. The non-food inflation continued its declining trend that has been
witnessed since the end of the last fiscal year while food inflation edged up to 10.6 percent in
November, 2006 from 10.5 percent in October, 2006.

Unlike CPI, the WPI and SPI inflation increased in the month under review; particularly
SPI inflation increased significantly from 11.8 percent in October, 2006 to 13.4 percent in
November 2006. The rise in SPI was due to sharp increase in prices of certain food items,
according to the Inflation Monitor..

Within the food group, prices of 51 commodities including fresh milk, sugar, beef, fish,
pulses gram, mash and moong, onion, and chillies exhibited double digit inflation in November
2006. The combined weight of such commodities (with double digit inflation) is about 48 percent
of the food group. On the other hand, prices of 12 commodities declined during the month under
review. The rest of items, having a weight of 43 percent in food group exhibited subdued or
moderate inflation.

In the non-food group, House rent index (HRI) maintained its declining trend which
started after February 2005, and recorded a moderate increase of 6.6 percent in November 2006
compared with about 10.8 percent in the corresponding month last year. Other sub-indexes of
non-food group that exhibited deceleration in November, 2006 included apparel, textile &
footwear, fuel & lighting, transport and communication, recreation and entertainment and
medicare. Fuel and lighting inflation declined to 10.5 percent in November 2006 from 11.3
percent in October, 2006. Most notable decline was recorded in transport and communication:
YoY inflation of 3.7 percent in November 2006 compared with 22.7 percent in the same month of
last year. On the other hand, education sub index registered a significant increase of 7.3 percent in
the month under review compared to 6.6 percent growth in the same month last year, says the
Inflation Monitor.

After declining for the four consecutive months, wage inflation remained at 13.0 percent
in November 2006. The wage inflation of skilled labour declined marginally whereas unskilled
workers depicted a higher YoY growth of 16.6 percent in the month under review. Further
breakup exhibited that the wages of carpenters, laborers, and plumbers increased with higher than
previous month rate while the masons and electricians showed deceleration in their wage inflation.

State Bank issues Guidelines for Livestock Financing

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued ‘Guidelines for Livestock Financing’
in order to facilitate and encourage the banks/financial institutions in enhancing the
flow of credit to the livestock sector. The guidelines cover all areas of the livestock
financing business including loan purpose & objectives, product development,
eligibility of borrowers, delivery channels, monitoring mechanism etc.

With the issuance of these guidelines, banks/Financial Institutions are
expected to considerably enhance the flow of credit to this important sector of the
economy. Banks may adopt the guidelines in its present form or with some
modifications that suit their organizational needs and market characteristics.

It may be pointed out that the livestock is the largest sub-sector of the
agriculture accounting for 47 percent of value addition in the sector and constitutes
about 11 percent of the GDP. The disbursements of credit to the agriculture sector
have witnessed significant growth during the last few years as a result of sector
friendly policies of the State Bank of Pakistan and efforts of the commercial banks.
However, the livestock sub-sector could not get the due share in the substantially
enhanced flow of credit to the agriculture sector.

In view of the contribution of the livestock sector to GDP & employment
creation especially in rural areas, the SBP had established a Committee of Experts to
devise a strategy for increasing the share of institutional finance to this sector which
has huge growth potential. In the light of the recommendations of the Expert
Committee and inputs from the stakeholders including the banking sector and the
Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Livestock (MINFAL), the State Bank has
framed these guidelines.

NCCC Reviews Monetary and Credit Developments
during the first half of current fiscal year.

The mid-term review meeting of the National Credit Consultative Council
(NCCC) was held in Karachi today with Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank
of Pakistan in the Chair. The Council reviewed the monetary and credit developments
during the first six months of FY06.

Dr. Shamshad Akhtar underscored the need to develop and deepen the fixed
income securities market to offload credit pressure on commercial banks for long-
term corporate financing. She also expressed her concern over the rising banking
spread and emphasized the need for shifting some benefits to depositors in the wake
of rising lending rates. She reiterated SBP’s commitment to ensure adequate
availability of funds to the SME and other priority sectors of the economy. While
commenting on issue of subsidized credit for export refinance, she was of the view
that the key issue was to have access to credit to boost exports rather than the price of
credit because the price of credit is market determined. Dr. Akhtar also desired to
enhance the scope of NCCC meetings and informed the Council that these meetings
would be held well before the issuance of six-monthly Monetary Policy Statement
(MPS) in order to consider views/feedback from both banks and private sector for
policy decisions.

The Council was informed that the broad money showed a growth of 7.9
percent (Rs.236 billion) during July-December 2005 compared with the Credit Plan
target of 12.8 percent (Rs.380 billion) and actual growth of 9.8 percent (Rs.244
billion) in the same period of last year. The broad money growth stemmed from the
enormity of private sector credit off-take (Rs.297.6 billion) and sizable government
borrowings for budgetary support (Rs.78 billion) despite depletion in the net foreign
assets of the banking system. The Council was informed that the distribution of credit
to private sector was broad based and reflected growing confidence of business
community due to consistency of policies, on-going expansion in industrial base of
the country, growing working capital requirements particularly in textile and cement
industry. The credit to SME sector continued to expand and increased by Rs.30.9
billion during July November 05.

While elaborating on future outlook of monetary and credit developments, Dr.
Akhtar stated that although the bank credit to the private sector is likely to exceed the
credit plan indicative target of Rs.330 billion, broad money expansion by the end of
the current fiscal year is likely to be close to the credit plan target of 12.8 percent
(Rs.380 billion) primarily due to expected improvement in the budgetary position of

the government.

STATE BANK COMMITTED TO DEVELOP
ISLAMIC BANKING IN THE COUNTRY: DR. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar presided over a
meeting of the Chief Executives of present and up-coming full fledged Islamic Banks
at SBP, Karachi today.

Speaking on the occasion, she said that Islamic banking was growing rapidly
not only in Pakistan but also throughout the world. She said that the Islamic banking
has great potential to grow in future in Pakistan and the State Bank was committed to
the development of this industry. She impressed upon the heads of Islamic banks to
meet the growing challenges in the development of Islamic banking.

‘Pakistan has provided a supportive policy and regulatory framework for
Islamic banking due to which investors of international repute are coming to establish
new Islamic banks in the country’, she added. She further said that the State Bank has
set up a dedicated Islamic Banking Department for the promotion and regulation of
this industry.

The Chief Executives of Islamic Banks highlighted the issues facing the
industry in its early stages of development. These include, for example, liquidity
management which would require an effective development of Islamic interbank
market and trained human resources. They were of the view that the rapid growth of
Islamic banking in the country would be dependent on providing level playing field to
both the conventional and Islamic Banks. The SBP has clarified to the industry that
there is a level playing field for Islamic Banks and has agreed to look at approaches to
develop Islamic interbank market.

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

Exchange rate has broad based implications for resource allocation, trade
openness, balance of payments and growth of the economy and therefore it needs to be
left to market fundamentals so that it aligns itself closer to the long run equilibrium rate.
Given the significance and sensitivities surrounding exchange rate policy regime, it is
critical for the central bank to ensure that market players understand well the exchange

dynamics in Pakistan and the central bank policy stance in this area.

I have convened this press conference following reports of misperceptions and
misunderstandings regarding central bank’s positioning on the exchange rate. Although
I have clarified on several occasions that the central bank is not in the business of
devaluing or artificially backing the currency but there continue to be speculations or
improper interpretation and pressures on the Government to manipulate and maneuver

the exchange rate.

To set the record right, the central bank abandoned fixed exchange rate regime a
long time ago and moved to a floating exchange rate regime since early 2000. While the
initial years of reforms did see sharp depreciation of the rupee, with the emergence of
macroeconomic stability, Pakistan has enjoyed a degree of exchange rate stability, which

has augured well for restoring investor confidence.

The Debate on exchange rate adjustments has lately been re-triggered by a set of
events which have included recent weaknesses in the export performance and the recent
IMF Article IV Report. There are some clarifications that are in order to set the debate
right in this context right. The IMF has not advocated, in its consultations with Pakistan,
any depreciation and rather has provided its perspective and analysis of the movements
in the real effective exchange rate. The exchange rate assessment offered by analysts is
often highly eclectic and subjective in nature as different approaches and methodologies
offer different inferences. Abstracting from theoretical debates, the reality is that

Pakistan exchange rate regime is determined in the interbank market and trends are

SBP GOVERNOR STRESSES THE NEED FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIXED INCOME MARKET

‘Fixed income market development is the key agenda for the next phase of the financial
sector reforms in Pakistan. New approaches and instruments need to be promoted to enhance the
depth and accessibility of fixed income markets’. This was stated by the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar while delivering her keynote address at a two-day international
conference on ‘Fixed Income Market Development in Emerging Market Economies’ at SBP,
Karachi today.

A well developed fixed income market helps expose banks to competition which in turn
helps improve their efficiency. Indeed, extraordinary banking spreads in Pakistan in recent years
is an evidence of lack of competition and efficiency in Pakistan’s financial markets, she observed.

Dr. Akhtar said: ‘Banks can promote supply of bonds in the market through issuance of
bonds to supplement commercial banks’ liquidity beyond their deposit base which then helps
banks finance the corporate requirements and finance Tier II capital which facilitates eventually
banks compliance with Basel II requirements. Moreover, banks’ ability to pack off and spin their
nonperforming loans as recapitalization or junk bonds allows them space to lend by relieving
banks of these bad debts’.

She said that the banks were often among the most important issuers, holders, dealers,
advisers, underwriters and guarantors in the market. ‘Banks can issue long-term bonds for Asset
Liability Management (ALM). This is particularly relevant from the perspective of financing long
term projects. To further manage their risk profiles in changing interest rate environments, there
are now sophisticated risk-management tools such as Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) at their disposal’,
the Governor added.

Dr. Akhtar said that Pakistan’s private corporate debt market remains underdeveloped
and is below one percent of GDP. The major drivers of financial assets in Pakistan are deposits
and government bonds, whereas corporate bond issuances remain a miniscule portion, with the
total outstanding issues at Rs49.3 billion (0.64% of GDP) at end FY06, in comparison with Korea
at 21.1% and Malaysia at 38.2%. Pakistan’s corporate debt history is relatively short as issuance
of “Term Finance Certificates” (TFCs), popular corporate paper, was allowed only from 1995
onwards.

Like other central banks, SBP as a first step has been preoccupied with the development
of government securities market which is a prerequisite for development of debt markets. Efforts
of SBP have facilitated development of an effective market determined yield curve for
government securities which sets the stage for corporate debt market, she observed

Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), introduced in 2000, is now the longest tenor sovereign
bonds, providing the benchmark yield curve for private issuances. The National Savings
Schemes (NSS), on the other hand, with tenors upto 10 years, provide risk-free investment
options to retail and institutional investors, the Governor added.

ACAC EXPRESSES SATISFACTION OVER THE DISBURSEMENT OF
CREDIT TO THE AGRI. SECTOR DURING FIRST HALF OF FY06

The Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) met in Karachi today
under the Chairmanship of the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad
Akhtar to review the flow of credit to agriculture sector during the first six months of
the current fiscal year.

The Committee expressed satisfaction that the growth momentum in
agriculture credit disbursement achieved during the last two years was maintained in
the first half of the current fiscal year (July-December 2005) as banks disbursed Rs.62
billion to this sector, which is 25% higher than the disbursement of Rs.49.5 billion
made in the corresponding period last year. The five big banks, as a group, disbursed
Rs.33.5 billion while ZTBL, domestic private banks and PPCBL disbursed Rs.19.303
billion, Rs.7.1 billion and Rs.2 billion respectively.

The ACAC noted with satisfaction that major portion of the credit i.e. 68%,
went to the small farmers whereas the medium and big farmers received 23% and 9%
respectively of the total credit disbursed during the first half of the current fiscal year.
Livestock, dairy farming and poultry, having an important role in the poverty
reduction, received 11% of the total disbursement as against the target of 8%.

The Committee expressed the hope that the banks would take necessary steps
to further accelerate the pace of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector during
the next six months so that the full year target of Rs.130 billion should be achieved
comfortably.

Dr. Shamshad Akhtar while expressing satisfaction over the handsome growth
in disbursement of credit to the agriculture sector stressed upon the banks to formulate
long term vision and strategy to develop agriculture finance as a business line. She
said that the sector promises opportunities for diversification, attractive returns both to
the banks and the economy, and has enormous growth potential as the existing
outreach of institutional credit to the sector is just 15% of the total potential market of
about 6.6 million rural households. She said that a strategy would be developed in
consultation and collaboration with the banks and other stakeholders to increase the
outreach of institutional credit to 50% or 3.3 million rural households during the next
3-5 years as envisioned by the Committee in its last meeting held in July 2005.

She also emphasized upon the provincial governments to ensure speedy
issuance of passbooks to the farmers to enable them to avail bank credit.

NON-FOOD INFLATION DECLINES TO 7.4% IN AUGUST, 2006

Non-food inflation has declined to 7.4 percent in August 2006 from 8.8 percent in the
corresponding month of the last fiscal year, according to the State Bank’s monthly publication
titled ‘Inflation Monitor’, which has been released on its website today.

However, the headline inflation increased in the second month of the current fiscal year
primarily due to an upsurge in food inflation coming from supply disturbances on the back of
recent rains and floods that not only affected production but also transportation of commodities
from farm and mills to the markets. Consumer price inflation has been recorded at 8.9 percent
YoY in August 2006 compared with 8.4 percent in the same month of the last fiscal year. Food
inflation has been registered at 11.1 percent — the highest of the last 13 months.

After being recorded at less than 7 percent on average during FY06, food inflation increased
significantly to 11 percent YoY in August 2006, driven mainly by increase in prices of wheat flour,
bread, cooking oil and ghee, chicken, eggs and vegetables including onion, tomatoes, and green
chillies along with persistent pressure on prices of some pulses. Contrary to food inflation, non-
food inflation declined from 8.8 percent in August 2005 to 7.4 percent in the month under review
primarily due to decline in inflation of transport & communication sub-index and continued
deceleration in house rent index, says the Inflation Monitor.

Core inflation measured as non-food non-energy declined from 6.3 percent in July to 6.2 percent
in August 2006, while trimmed mean core inflation showed an increase from 6 percent at the end
of FY06 to 6.5 percent in August 2006. The rise in trimmed mean core inflation is due to some
key food and energy items, having very high weight and high inflation, like fresh milk, beef,
mutton, potatoes and petrol supper. Thus, the recent inflation has primary been coming from
supply factors, while the demand factors still remained under control with the deceleration in
money and credit growth during the initial months of FY07 and rise in interest rates.

Wages of construction workers showed a deceleration due to temporary slowdown in the
construction work because of rains during the month under review. Wage inflation has been
recorded at 15.9 percent in August 2006 compared with 17 percent in the preceding month.
However, it was higher than that recorded in the corresponding month of the last fiscal year. On
the disaggregated level, wages of skilled workers increased by 15.7 percent, and those of
labourers by 16.9 percent, which were lower as compared with July. As the nominal wages
decelerated and CPI inflation increased, real wage inflation went down significantly and recorded
at 6.9 percent in August 2006 compared with a higher rate of 9.4 percent during a month earlier,
according to the Inflation Monitor.

CORE INFLATION DECLINES TO 5.7 PER CENT IN OCTOBER

Core inflation as well as headline inflation declined during October 2006. Core inflation
measured as non-food non-energy (NFNE) was recorded at 5.7 percent and trimmed-mean core
inflation was 6.4 per cent during the month under review compared with 7.8 and 7 percent
respectively in the month of October last year, according to the State Bank’s monthly publication
titled ‘Inflation Monitor’ which has been released on its website today.

The SBP Inflation Monitor says the headline inflation exhibited a lesser growth of 8.1 per cent in
October 2006 compared with the growth in preceding month (September). It was less than the
same month of the last fiscal year.

Non-food inflation has declined significantly to 6.4 per cent in October, 2006 — the lowest level
for the last two years. In August and September, 2006, the non-food inflation was recorded at 7.4
and 7 per cent respectively. Nonetheless, pressure on food inflation still exists which is also
evident from a considerably high rate of growth in SPI. However, WPI continued its declining
trend and came down to 6.7 percent during the month under review, says the Inflation Monitor.

A closer look at price movements of individual items included in the CPI food group reveals that
prices of 49 commodities including fresh milk, beef, sugar, chicken, pulses gram, mash and
moong, cooked mutton, honey, tomatoes, chilies green etc. exhibited double digit inflation with a
combined weight 52.4 per cent in total food group. On the other hand, prices of 14 commodities
like apple, ginger, pulse masoor declined during the month under review. The rest of items,
having a weight of 35 per cent in food group, exhibited subdued or moderate inflation.

In the non-food group, House rent index (HRI) maintained its declining trend, which started after
February 2005, and recorded a moderate increase of 6.9 per cent in October 2006 compared with
about 11.1 per cent in the corresponding month of the last fiscal year. Inflation in Fuel and
Lighting declined to 11.3 per cent in October 2006 compared to 12.1 per cent in the preceding
month. Most notable decline was recorded in transport and communication that already had been
showing a continuous decrease since November 2006: Year on Year (YoY) inflation of 3.8 per
cent in October 2006 compared with 22.7 per cent in the same month of the last fiscal year. On
the other hand, medicare registered a significant increase in prices with a rate of 9.9 per cent in
the month under review compared with 1.6 per cent growth in the same month last year.

Wage inflation that started declining from the start of FY07 continued its decelerating trend in

October 2006 resulting from lower wages of both skilled and unskilled workers on account of
slow down in construction activities, the Inflation Monitor added.

STATE BANK RELEASES ‘INFLATION MONITOR’ FOR MAY 2006

The State Bank of Pakistan released its monthly publication titled ‘Inflation
Monitor’, which gives an objective analysis of inflationary trends and reviews different
aspects of price movements, for the month of May 2006 on its website today.

After declining successively during the last three months, the consumer price
inflation resurged in May 2006 and posted at 7.1 percent year-on-year compared with 6.2
percent in April 2006. The resurgence has also been observed in other two measures of
inflation, viz. wholesale price index and sensitive price indicator. Although both food and
non-food inflation increased during the month under review, the food group remained the
key contributor to overall inflation, according to the Inflation Monitor.

Food inflation (CPI) increased to 5.6 percent in May 2006, up from 3.6 percent in
April 2006. The Inflation Monitor pointed out that this increase was mainly due to a weak
base along with significant increase in prices of a number of important items including
milk, meat, sugar, potatoes, cold drinks, and pulses. The average price of pulses recorded
more than 60 percent increase over May 2005. Price of sugar, though slightly declined in
May 2006 as compared with the last month (April 2006), is still 40 percent above than
that of May 2005.

Non-food inflation (CPI) rose to 8.2 percent during May 2006 as compared to 8
percent inflation recorded during April 2006 as well as in the corresponding month last
year. Increase in non-food inflation during the month under review was mainly
contributed by higher inflation in fuel & lighting, furniture & equipments, cleaning,
laundry & personal appearance and education, according to the Inflation Monitor.

Core inflation (Non-food non-energy) also witnessed an increase of 6.6 percent in
May 2006 after a continuous decline for the last several months. According to the
Inflation Monitor, the increase in core inflation was mainly due to second round effect of
the earlier increase in oil prices which has been reflected in the rising transportation cost
and consequently in general price level.

Wage inflation increased significantly during the month under review with
average wages of construction workers (carpenter, mason, labourer, plumber, and
electrician) rising by 16.9 percent in May 2006 as compared with 14.2 percent in April
2006. This increase in overall wage inflation was contributed by higher wages of both the
skilled and unskilled workers, the Inflation Monitor added. (For complete text of the

NCCC Projects 13.5 % Monetary Expansion for FY07

The annual meeting of the National Credit Consultative Council (NCCC) was
held in Karachi today with Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan in
the chair. The Council reviewed the monetary and credit developments during the last
fiscal year and proposed the Credit Plan for FY07.

The State Bank presented the Credit Plan for FY07 which will be approved by
SBP Central Board of Directors at its meeting being held in Karachi on July 6, 2006.
She pointed out that the targets under the Credit Plan for FY07 should be treated as
minimum requirements to support economic growth. The credit plan envisages the
broad money to grow by 13.5 percent (Rs.459.9 billion) based on the GDP growth
target of 7 percent and the inflation target of 6.5 percent set for the current fiscal year.
The NDA of the banking system is expected to expand by Rs.450.1 billion this year.
NFA of the banking system is projected to rise moderately by Rs.9.8 billion. In line
with the budget, the government sector is estimated to absorb bank credit to the extent
of Rs.130.1 billion (Rs.120.1 billion for budgetary support and Rs.10 billion for
commodity operations). Credit to private sector is estimated at Rs.390 billion.

The Council expressed its concern that the liquidity position will remain tight
due to large recourse of the government from the banking system, given the fiscal
expansion anticipated for 2006-07. Dr. Akhtar informed the Council that the State
Bank would strive to meet the challenge of maintaining price stability during the
fiscal year 2007 and asked the Pakistan Banks Association for its assistance in
bringing down the spread between the lending and deposit rates for the benefit of
small depositors and also stretching the maturity of deposits to create room for long
term project financing. She assured the participants that data on new bank borrowers
would be provided to the NCCC participants.

The SBP Governor has, in principle, agreed to (i) set up an Infrastructure Task
Force to help improve the financing to meet the growing requirements of the
economy; (ii) examine the feasibility of allowing the refinance facility on Islamic
Banking principles. The Council was of the view that provincial governments should
lower the stamp duty which is levied on corporate debt papers and securitization. The
Council also proposed the provision of data on provincial distribution of industrial
credit and recommended for enhancement of credit to SME sector in order to alleviate
poverty.

Dr Shamshad Akhtar informed the Council that NCCC had been constituted in
September 1972 by the Federal Government to ensure optimal utilization of bank
credit through the process of directed credit to various sectors. Now that on-going
financial sector reforms have virtually led to the stoppage of all directed and
subsidized credit and that the credit planning process is completely market-based, it is
highly desirable to change the status of NCCC consistent with forces of free market
economy. Therefore, she proposed that NCCC be renamed as Private Sector Credit

ascertain as to how a sizeable amount of fresh currency notes has been sneaked into the open
market. The State Bank would take stern action against those banks found involved in selling
fresh notes to the unauthorized currency dealers who in turn have been selling notes to the

SBP GOVERNOR STRESSES THE NEED FOR BUILDING
SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR.

The State Bank Governor, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar has emphasized that building
sustainable financial services systems for poor is of critical interest and requires laying
foundation for potentially profitable market and enterprises that can develop ways to
reduce the costs and risks of serving them.

In her keynote address at a seminar on ‘Improving Access to Financial Services: Mobile
Money Transfer and Beyond’ which was jointly organized by the SBP and ADB in
Karachi today, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar said: ‘Both SBP and banking industry are working
towards exploring options on how to reach financial services to un-banked segments of
population and will be able to draw from lessons and experience of the region’.

She said that while encouraging e-banking and e-commerce, SBP is now working
closely with the banking industry to explore options for adoption of new technologies to
reach under-banked areas with the objective of enhancing access of rural, agriculture
and microfinance credit and to attract international remittances. In this respect, strategic
alliances with overseas partners with special focus on technological compatibility are
encouraged by SBP.

Dr Shamshad Akhtar highlighted the importance of sharing regional experiences of
strategic approaches, options and innovative connectivity models for rural and under-
served areas. She noted that developments in the financial industry and technology
have been mutually reinforcing with developments in data base management systems
along with networking has encouraged virtual and electronic banking and commerce
thereby facilitating an explosion of financial innovations. Additionally, the banking
industry has exploited different technologies to deliver financial services with the
proliferation of automated teller machine (ATM) and point-of-sale (POS) network and
devices. The use of a mobile phone to conduct payment and banking transactions (m-
banking) is at an early stage in a number of developing countries and is growing as
mobile phone service providers are penetrating in developing markets and setting up the
infrastructure. For improved coverage of mobile banking applications there is need to
develop proper sector regulation, effective institutional and commission arrangement
sharing amongst retailers, clients and outlets that accept and sell cash and commission
and to launch an aggressive marketing campaign that is geared for all types of users
and service providers.

In his opening remarks, Dr. Peter Fedon, Country Director, ADB’s Pakistan Resident
Mission stated that modern technology solutions hold much promise for increasing
access to efficient and sustainable financial services and reaching clients in remote or
under-serviced areas for continued economic growth. Mr. Fedon stressed the
importance of bringing in innovation and applying new technologies for improving
operational efficiencies, and reducing transaction costs associated with delivery for

SBP GOVERNOR, DR. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR
INAUGURATES e-CIB

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar formally
inaugurated the Electronic Credit Information Bureau (e-CIB) at a simple but impressive
ceremony held at SBP Learning Resource Centre, Karachi today.

Speaking on the occasion, the Governor said that the successful launch of e-CIB
was an excellent manifestation of collaboration between the State Bank of Pakistan and
the Pakistan Banks’ Association. ‘I hope this milestone will lay the foundation for our
future endeavours and cooperation in a wide range of areas and domains to strengthen our
financial system for the ultimate good of our economy and the country,’ she added.

Dr. Akhtar said that the rapid expansion in lending to consumers, SMEs and
agricultural sectors, both in volume and number of borrowers, in recent years has
changed the credit risk profile of the financial institutions. However, due to the previous
reporting limit of Rs.500,000/- and above, the small borrowers availing less than this
amount remained untapped by CIB. To capture these borrowers, the limit has been
removed, and the CIB’s reporting, operational and IT systems have also been redesigned
and upgraded to mirror the international best practices in the areas of credit information
sharing.

‘The strengthened capacity and improved operational efficiency of e-CIB is
expected to deliver benefits to both financial institutions and borrowers, and would also
help the supervisors to achieve and sustain their goal of financial stability,’ she added.

The Governor said the newly introduced features of the e-CIB system promise
considerable improvement in the core processes. The efficiency and credibility of CIB’s
data reporting, nevertheless, hinges largely on the integrity and timely supply of data by
the financial institutions. ‘Financial Institutions (FIs) should focus on data mining so that
they could translate the data into knowledge not only for the benefit of borrowers but also
for their own. The FIs should focus on their in-house capacity building to ensure that the
data submitted to the e-CIB is complete, accurate and in time. For this purpose, they can
establish special CIB units aligned with the size of their database,’ she added.

The SBP Governor said that the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) of SBP, ever
since its inception, has played an extremely important part in gathering, organizing and
disseminating critical information relating to credit-worthiness of borrowers to assist
financial institutions in their lending decisions and forestalling the occurrence of default.

HEADLINE INFLATION FALLS TO 7.6% IN JUNE, 2006

The headline inflation fell to 7.6 percent year-on-year in June 2006 that was one
percentage point less than the inflation recorded in the corresponding month of last year,
although inflationary pressures persisted in the economy for the second year in a row.
The inflation containment was more visible in the last six months of FY06 as compared
to first six months (Jul 05 to Dec 05): the average CPI inflation during the first half of the
year was 8.4 percent which declined to 7.4 percent in the second half primarily due to fall
in food inflation. The wholesale price inflation was 9 percent in June 2006 which was
lower than average inflation of more than 11 percent during the first six months of FY06,
according to the State Bank’s monthly publication titled ‘Inflation Monitor’.

The Inflation Monitor for the month of June, 2006 which was released on SBP
website today says that the CPI food inflation was recorded at 7.8 percent in June 2006
that was significantly lower than 9.3 percent in the corresponding month last year. The
Inflation Monitor finds that prices of some key food items like pulses and sugar started
declining though they are still very high as compared to the same period last year. The
non-food inflation was recorded at 7.5 percent during June 2006 against 8.4 percent in
June 2005.

Core inflation was recorded at 6.3 percent in June 2006 compared with 7.4
percent in June 2005. Although core inflation declined steadily during FY06, it seems the
rate of decline fell by the end of the year. Despite a declining trend in different measures
of inflation, the inflation is still very high in comparison with the average of past five
years, according to the Inflation Monitor which gives an objective analysis of inflationary
trends and reviews different aspects of price movements in the country.

Wage inflation increased significantly during June, 2006 with average wages of
construction workers (carpenter, mason, labourer, plumber, and electrician) rising by 18.2
per cent in June 2006. The real wage inflation also remained on a rising path and was
recorded at 10.6 percent in June 2006 compared with three percent in the corresponding
month of last year, the Inflation Monitor added. (For complete text of the ‘Inflation

RS. 160 BILLION TARGET ALLOCATED TO
AGRICULTURE SECTOR FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006-07

The annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
which was held in Karachi today with Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar in the chair, has approved a target of Rs.160 billion for the
disbursement of agriculture credit to the farmers during the fiscal year 2006-07. This
target is 23 per cent higher than the last fiscal year’s target of Rs.130 billion.

She underscored that these targets should be treated as ‘minimum
achievements’ required from the banks. While the central bank is not in the business
of directed credit, but it would encourage banks to achieve balanced regional and
sectoral distribution of credit to achieve sound economic development.

The five big commercial banks (ABL, HBL, MCB, NBP and UBL) have been
allocated a target of Rs.80 billion, Zarai Tarqiati Bank Ltd Rs.48 billion, Punjab
Provincial Co-operative Bank Ltd. Rs.9 billion and Domestic Private Banks as a
group Rs.23 billion. The committee also made province wise allocations of
disbursements, based on the cropped area and absorption capacity of each province
and AJK and FATA.

The Committee expressed its deep satisfaction that the total disbursement to
the agriculture sector during July-May 2005-06 has reached to Rs.117 billion, which
is 25.8% higher than the disbursements of Rs.93.0 billion during the same period of
the last fiscal year. The disbursements made during the eleven months are about 90%
of the full year target and considering the average disbursements of Rs.15 billion in
the month of June during last three years, the full year target of Rs.130 billion would
be achieved comfortably.

The five big commercial banks as a group disbursed Rs.59.8 billion against the
full year target of Rs.63 billion. Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL), Punjab
Provincial Cooperative Bank Limited (PPCBL) and domestic private banks (DPBs)
disbursed Rs.38.8 billion, Rs.4.5 billion and Rs.13.9 billion against the target of Rs.43
billion, Rs.9 billion and Rs.15 billion respectively. The five big Commercial Banks as
a group achieved about 95% of the full year target. ZTBL 90%, PPCBL 50% and the
DPBs as a group achieved 92.4% of their annual targets.

The Committee was informed that the disbursements to farm and non-farm
sectors as a whole during the first eleven months of the fiscal year 06 remained more
or less as per target with farm sector fetching Rs.95.7 billion or 81.8% against the
target of 80% and non-farm sector obtaining Rs.19 billion or 16.3% against the target
of 16%. The Committee expressed the hope that the banks would take necessary steps
to further accelerate the pace of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector so that
target of Rs.160 billion for the year 2006-07 is achieved comfortably.

State Bank launches Rs.100 and Rs.500 new design banknotes

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar launched
Rs. 100 and Rs. 500 new design banknotes at a simple but impressive
ceremony held today at SBP Head Office, Karachi. The launch of these
banknotes is part of State Bank’s campaign to eliminate counterfeiting of
notes in the country and to protect the public from this menace.

Dr. Shamshad Akhtar explained that the State Bank has taken
advantage of the latest technology to make these notes virtually
impossible to be forged by incorporating the state of the art security
features. These modern security features are not only easy to recognize
but almost impossible to be copied by the counterfeiters. However, it is
important for the public to become well versed with these security
features so that they can immediately recognize a counterfeited banknote
when they come across it. Dr. Akhtar urged the media to effectively play
their vital and constructive role in protecting the public by giving wide
coverage to these security features.

Some of the special security features added in the new design
banknotes are anti-copy and anti-scan, micro lettering, presence of latent
image of denomination which can be seen when the banknote is tilted,
window security thread that changes colours when seen against the light
and See-through feature in which only half of the denomination is visible
on each side and the denomination is fully visible only when the
banknote is seen through light.

The launch of these high tech banknotes is also expected to
revolutionize the banking business in Pakistan as these banknotes are
equipped with machine readable features. This will facilitate automation
of handling of banknotes by banks and use of equipment to detect

RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar today communicated to the
staff the revised organization structure of the Bank. The re-organization of the State
Bank was finalized after comprehensive review and deliberations across the organization
at different levels including the Corporate Management Team and the Heads of
Departments.

This re-organization has been introduced in order to strengthen SBP’s internal
governance systems and to restructure & modernize itself in line with the best practices
of other central banks and in the light of the developments that had taken place across
Pakistan’s financial markets.

The main feature of restructuring involves setting up of the following four distinct
Clusters in the State Bank:

1. Banking Cluster,

2. Monetary Policy & Research Cluster (MPR Cluster)

3. Financial Markets & Reserve Management Cluster (FMR Cluster)
4. Corporate Services Cluster (CS Cluster)

Each of the four Clusters will be headed by a Deputy Governor (DG) or an Executive
Director.

The Banking Cluster has been restructured to assign high priority and focus on:

1. Development Finance Group (DFG) with enhanced focus for creating
enabling environment to facilitate intermediation of market based/high
priority credit and help develop capacities to better understand the new niche
areas such as infrastructure, housing finance, Islamic banking, SME and
microfinance.

2. Banking Policy and Regulation Group (BPRG) which, besides developing
policy and regulation and performing licensing function, will be responsible
for resolution of problem banks, promoting good corporate governance and
facilitating strengthening of risk management including compliance with
Basle-II.

3. Banking Supervision Group (BSG) will be in charge of the on-site inspection
of banks as well as resultant enforcement actions.

The Monetary Policy and Research Cluster has been restructured to strengthen,
rationalize and streamline its role through separate departments of (1) Monetary Policy
Department, (2) Economic Analysis Department, (3) Research Department and (4)
Statistics & Data Warehouse Department.

A Financial Markets and Reserve Management Cluster has been set up to separately
manage the (1) Domestic Markets & Monetary Management (2) International Markets &
Investments (3) Financial Market Strategy & Conduct and Exchange Policy.

STATE BANK TO LAUNCH NEW DESIGNED BANKNOTES OF VARIOUS
DENOMINATIONS DURING THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

The State Bank of Pakistan will launch new designed banknotes of Rs.50/-,
Rs.100/-, Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- during the next fiscal year. New designed banknotes
of Rs.10/-, Rs.20/- and Rs.5000/- had already been introduced by the State Bank of
Pakistan.

The purpose of launching of new designed banknotes with high-tech security
features is to minimize the possibility of counterfeiting of these notes, the chief
spokesman of the State Bank of Pakistan said in a statement issued to the media
today.

He pointed out that the rapid technological advancements in digital imaging
and printing helped counterfeiters to easily forge banknotes which lacked advanced
security features. To meet these threats, there had been a significant technological
change in banknote designs and features internationally to make the modern
banknotes difficult to forge as well as to efficiently process the notes through
electronic devices such as note counting machines etc. Most note processing machines
in the market now require the availability of machine readable features also in
banknotes to detect counterfeiting through colour printers/photocopiers. This
necessitated the introduction of new designed banknotes in the country, the
spokesman added.

Responding to the criticism in the media regarding the introduction of
Rs.5000/- denomination banknote, the spokesman said that the main benefit of
introducing Rs.5000/- banknote was to provide convenience and facilitate higher
value transactions. Issuance of larger denominated note also economises the
expenditure on printing of notes as higher denomination notes would reduce the
consumption of lower denomination notes. He pointed out that the old denomination
banknotes were introduced many years ago and there has not been any significant
change in their design and features since then. The last major change in our banknotes
occurred in July 1987 when a new banknote of Rs.1000/- was introduced. At that
time, the total notes in circulation was Rs.78 billion which has now gone upto nearly
Rs.800 billion, he added.

Referring to the criticism of See-through feature introduced in the new
designed banknotes of Rs.10, 20 & Rs.5000, the spokesman said this is one of the
most significant anti-copier/ anti-scanner features introduced to minimize their
counterfeiting. These features will also appear at the new designed banknotes of
Rs.50, Rs.100, Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations.

Under the See-through feature, the Urdu numeral of the banknote appears
partly at the obverse left top and partly at the reverse right top of Rs.10, Rs.20,

State Bank establishes Task Force for promoting
Research and Development in Islamic Banking

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar presided over a
meeting of the Shariah Advisors of present and up-coming Islamic Banking Institutions at
SBP, Karachi today.

Speaking on the occasion, she reiterated the State Bank’s commitment to promote
Islamic banking in its true letter and spirit and appreciated the role of Shariah Advisors in
providing right and balanced guidance to the industry. She said that in order to fully
realize the potential of Islamic banking in Pakistan, which is at a primary stage at present,
the financial needs of urban as well as rural areas should be met in a Shariah compliant
manner. There is a need of raising the level of awareness about the concepts and practices
of Islamic banking, the Governor added.

The Shariah Advisors of Islamic banking institutions appreciated the role of State
Bank in promotion of this industry. They said that we need to focus on providing
adequate educational and training facilities in Islamic banking and development of
Islamic interbank market. In order to promote research and development as well as
training and academic curricula for different levels of education, a Task Force comprising
the Shariah advisors of banks has been set up in the State Bank.

The meeting, hosted by Director Islamic Banking Department, Mr. Pervez Said,

SBP & INCEIF STRIVING TO BUILD STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIP IN ISLAMIC FINANCE

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the International Centre for Education in
Islamic Finance (INCEIF), Malaysia are striving to build strategic partnership for the
development of Islamic Finance in Pakistan.

For this purpose, Prof. Dato' Dr. Sudin Haron — Deputy Chief Executive of the
International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) held a meeting with_Mr.
Pervez Said, Director, Islamic Banking Department, State Bank of Pakistan in Karachi
yesterday and presented to him a draft MoU from the Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia
for the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan. The MoU seeks to provide a framework of
cooperation to promote and undertake research, development, training and education in
Islamic finance.

During the meeting, Dr. Haron, who is a renowned academician in Islamic
banking and finance, apprised Mr. Pervez Said of the standards being observed in
INCEIF at various levels including its faculty which comprises Islamic financial services
industry experts as well as renowned international and local scholars in the area of
Shariah and finance. He also stressed upon the need for establishing strategic alliance
with leading higher learning institutions of Pakistan in overcoming the problem of lack of
adequately qualified human capital in Islamic finance.

Mr. Pervez Said said that Islamic banking in Pakistan is growing at a rapid pace
attracting both local and international investors. The industry has now gained a market
share of over 2.2%, which was just 0.5% in 2003. He appreciated the plans of INCEIF for
promoting education and research in this emerging field. Although the industry is
developing at a fast pace, yet there is a dearth of quality training and research in Islamic
financial services industry which can be met through forging strategic alliance with other
countries where Islamic banking is being practiced, he observed.

Mr. Pervez said that the State Bank of Pakistan has granted licence to six full-
fledged Islamic banks and 11 conventional banks for providing dedicated Islamic
banking services through their 98 branches in all the four provinces of Pakistan.
Moreover, SBP has recently set up a Task Force on Capacity Building and Research &
Development in Islamic Banking to explore ways and means for tackling various issues
being faced by this rapidly growing industry.

It may be pointed out that the INCEIF was established in December 2005 by Bank

LAST MONTH INFLATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER THAN IN JULY, 2005

The current fiscal year commenced with almost the same headline inflation as
witnessed during the last month of the previous fiscal year. The consumer price
inflation remained at 7.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) in July 2006 — the same rate that
was recorded in June 2006. However, it was significantly lower than inflation of 9 per
cent during the corresponding month of the last fiscal year. Although non-food
inflation witnessed slight increase during July, 2006, its impact on overall inflation
was offset by decline in food inflation. Sensitive price indicator also maintained its
last month’s (June, 2006) rate of increase. Wholesale price index, however, declined
noticeably which was supported mainly by decline in WPI food inflation, according to
the State Bank’s monthly publication titled ‘Inflation Monitor’ which has been
released on its website today.

After being recorded at 7.8 percent in June 2006, food inflation declined to 7.4
percent YoY in July 2006. Price movements of individual items in the CPI food group
show that prices of 26 food items including eggs, pulse masur, wheat, apple, etc. have
shown YoY decline during July 2006. On the other hand, prices of 31 items exhibited
double digit YoY inflation which include, among others, beef sugar, pulses gram,
mash and moong, potato, tomato, etc. However, the rate of increase in prices of most
of these items declined in July, 2006 as compared to June 2006. The rest of the items,
having a weight of 47 percent in food group exhibited subdued or moderate inflation.

Non-food inflation increased slightly from 7.5 percent YoY in June 2006 to
7.8 percent in July, 2006 primarily due to rise in gas charges and train and air fares.
However, the main component of non-food inflation, i.e. house rent index continued
to decelerate. It declined from 30 per cent in July, 2005 to 24 per cent in July, 2006.

Core inflation measured by non-food non-energy, that had been declining for the last
several months ceased to decline further in July 2006, while the core inflation
measured by trimmed mean has shown reversal in its past trend of decline.

The wage inflation was 17.0 percent in July 2006 compared with 18.2 percent
in the previous month. However, it was significantly higher than 11.6 percent in July
last year. Wages of skilled workers increased by 16.8 percent and those of labourers
increased by 18.5 percent during July, 2006. The average real wage inflation kept
rising but with the slow rate of 9.4 percent in July 2006 as compared with 10.6
percent in the preceding month.

70,2006-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,"Monetary Policy Statement for Jul-Dec 2006

This statement is based on information received up to July 27, 2006

 

Highlights

State Bank and the Government of Pakistan have managed to achieve a fair
degree of success in containing inflationary pressures with average increase
in consumer price index close to annual F'Y06 target of 8 percent.

Money supply growth for FY06, while higher than target, remained well
contained and much below average broad money (M2) growth of the last few
years.

Real GDP growth target of 7 percent for FY07 set by government seems
achievable as strong aggregate demand lends confidence that investment and
capacity expansion will gain further momentum in the economy.

Balance of risk has tilted towards managing domestic and external imbalances
effectively and curbing inflationary pressures.

Though inflation decelerated, the need to reduce volatility and achieve further
reduction in inflation rate to 6.5 percent (FYO7 target) underscores need for
continued effective economic management.

Meeting investment requirements of growing productive sector is assigned
high priority by SBP that recently offered special financing incentives for
textiles and exports, and has underscored need for diverse sector
requirements, while keeping risk exposure tightly within limits.

Most critical will be the need to diversify the source of domestic borrowings to
keep central bank financing within manageable limits by, among others,
issuing long-term debt which would set a benchmark for catalyzing corporate
debt.

Banks have been incentivized through recent change in cash reserve
requirement/statutory liquidity requirement (CRR/SLR) to improve returns to
depositors, and tighten their internal control systems, while managing their
exposures effectively.

SBP is further tightening its monetary policy by raising its policy rate (SBP 3-
day Repo Rate) from 9 percent by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent.

These measures coupled with effective consultations between the State Bank
and Ministry of Finance on the level and mix of domestic borrowings lends
confidence that money supply growth will be contained and aligned to the
nominal GDP growth in FY07.

SBP GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES THE MERGER OF
LMM & LTF-EOP SCHEMES

The existing scheme for financing Locally Manufactured Machinery (LMM) is
being merged with scheme for Long Term Financing for the Export-Oriented Projects
(LTF-EOP) to provide a level playing field to exporters for setting up and balancing,
modernization and replacement (BMR) of Export Oriented Projects/Units. The new
proposed scheme titled as “Long Term Financing Scheme for Imported & Locally
Manufactured Machinery” is being finalized and would be issued shortly replacing the
existing LTF-EOP and LMM Schemes.

This was disclosed by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad

Akhtar at a news conference in Karachi today.

She said that in the meantime the LTF-EOP Scheme has been modified or

amended as under with immediate effect:-

= SBP is lowering the spread on new scheme, which allows financing coverage for
both imported & local machinery, by one percentage point, thereby reducing
banks spread from 3% to 2%.

= To meet the growing financing demand of the borrowers, the procedure for limits
allocation is being revised, in particular more allocation is being provided to the
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs). Instead of present practice of allocating
LTF-EOP limit as sub-limit of EFS, the PFIs will be allocated separate limits
which will be aligned to their demand.

= The utilization of at least 50% of the total limits by PFIs for SME sector is being
withdrawn. However, PFIs are advised to give preference to meet the financing
needs of the SME borrowers.

""Only SME borrowers, as defined in Prudential Regulations for SMEs, are allowed
to purchase plant, machinery, equipments and accessories from the commercial
importers.

= To meet the energy requirements of the export oriented projects, the import of
generators shall also be eligible for financing under the scheme.

SBP GOVERNOR PROPOSES ECO CENTRAL BANKS NETWORK

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has proposed the
launching of an ECO Central Banks Network (ECBN) with a view to enhance cooperation
amongst respective central banks of member countries of the Economic Cooperation
Organization (ECO).

She made this proposal while addressing the first meeting of the heads/representatives
of central banks of ECO member countries at a local hotel in Karachi today.

Dr Akhtar said that the proposed network could focus on exchange of experiences
and information on economic and monetary policy approaches and respective banking
regulations. The network could also help nurture greater cross border cooperation of financial
flows including possibilities of cooperation on anti-money laundering and explore
opportunities for harmonization of standards and systems, where feasible, she added.

Dr Akhtar underlined that the cooperation would involve sharing perceptions on the
objectives of policy coordination and corresponding institutional coherence for:

(i) Macroeconomic and Financial Stability. This could cover discussion on exchange
rate regimes, prudent debt management domestic financial deepening, and
international developments. In addition, there should be discussion on the level and
extent of harmonization of banking sector policies and regulations to the extent
feasible.

(ii) Launching of a study to benchmark the state of economies, monetary policy regime
and banking sector, their size & dimensions, and comparison of banking sector
policies and regulation, and state of corporate governance etc.

(iii) Developing an agreed approach and framework for encouraging and facilitating
opening of bank branches by the member countries in each others’ territories.

(iv) Facilitation to intraregional trade and commerce. To support this, the network should
devise an efficient settlement framework and to examine the correspondent banking
facilities for trade finance transactions.

(v) Promoting capacity building among member central banks. Among others, Pakistan
would offer its National Institute of Banking and Finance to serve as a regional hub
for training of central banks’ staff and launching specific courses for banking for the
region. Member states should proactively participate in structuring course work and
delivery in this hub.

(vi) Enhancement of supervisory regimes for financial sector in member countries. Work
together to strengthen the supervisory regimes in respective jurisdictions by
enlightening ourselves with each others’ experiences and best practices.

(vii)Sharing of information and experiences. We need to establish and strengthen regular
mechanisms of consultations, communication, the sharing of information and
expertise as well as the identification and implementation of joint projects and
activities among the member countries.

It may be mentioned that ECO is an inter-governmental regional organization
established in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. In 1992, the organization was expanded to
include seven new members, namely: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

The ECO region, which has a population of 400 million, has tremendous economic
potential and offers promising ground for fostering economic integration. The region is
growing at around 6.2% on average, while real gross domestic product in the region
aggregates to $800 billion. The region is home to 8% of the world’s crude oil production and
9.2% of global natural gas production.

Size of Pakistan’s progressive & dynamic
financial sector reaches Rs 6.9 Tin (US $114.6 Blin

The overall size of Pakistan’s progressive and dynamic financial sector, which has
grown rapidly particularly in the last few years in response to the mounting financing
needs of the country, has increased by almost Rs 900 billion (32 percent growth over
December 2005) to reach Rs 6.9 trillion up to June, 2007. Banks, with a share of 72
percent in total assets, continue to dominate the asset base of the financial sector.

This is stated in the “Financial Stability Review 2006” (FSR), a new annual
publication released by the State Bank of Pakistan today. The FSR upgrades the
analytical content of the “Financial Sector Assessment Report”, published by the SBP
since 2002. The FSR gives a candid perspective and analysis of financial stability, and
provides an objective view on the developments in the financial sector. Providing an in-
depth analysis of issues of relevance, the report offers an exhaustive overview of the
financial institutions and markets. The ultimate objective is to suggest appropriate policy-
direction for the financial sector as a whole. The Report endeavors to promote informed
public debate on various aspects of the financial system.

In publishing its first FSR, SBP joins the league of central banks around the globe
that analyze and comment on financial stability issues on a periodic basis, with the
objective of highlighting the strengths as well as potential triggers for systemic risk. With
the added objective of increasing the outreach of informed public debate, the report is
being released in both English and Urdu.

A distinguishing feature of the FSR is the discussion on strategic thematic areas
which are covered under two parts: Part I explores issues of efficiency of financial
intermediation, consolidation and diversification of the financial sector, and financial
savings and allocative efficiency of bank credit. Part II provides performance analysis of
the components of the financial sector, covering banks, non-bank financial institutions,
financial markets, and the insurance industry. As analytical content in the report is based
on data for 2006, the report, where feasible, also updates analysis up to June 2007.

Key messages of the report are: structural transformation of the financial sector is
significant and is owed to the dedicated implementation of the reform process. The
financial sector has grown substantially both in size and qualitative terms in recent years.
The reform process is paving the way for a more diversified financial sector, equipped to
facilitate the economic growth process. The outreach of the financial sector, albeit slow,
continues to gain ground with the expanding network of commercial banks, microfinance
institutions and Islamic banks in all parts of the country.

the current fiscal year 2007-08.

She made these observations while chairing the second meeting of the
Private Sector Credit Advisory Council held at State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this
morning. The meeting dwelt at length on recent trends and issues relating to
availability of credit to the private sector and discussed ways and means to
enhance credit disbursement to key sectors of the economy.

Dr Akhtar said the growth in private sector credit was broadly in line with
last two years’ comparable period growth, and expanded by Rs 103.1 billion in
the period from July 1, 2007 to November 24, 2007. Private sector credit growth
in FYO7-08 mainly reflects convergence to its long-term trend, relative to the
surge observed in FY05-06 due to several years of pent up demand and need
for investments in BMR by the industry.

The Governor stressed that in FYO7, the credit growth supported
effectively the growth in real economic activity. It is expected that private sector
credit disbursement this year will continue to support economic growth as SBP
has continued to efficiently managed liquidity.

“Private sector credit is expected to pick up in second half of FYO8 as
investors launch the pending projects and various IPP (Independent Power
Producers) projects are also in pipeline involving investment of around Rs100-120
billion,” the Governor added.

There was a general agreement that the private sector credit has been
impacted, among others by (i) banks adopting cautious lending stance given the
experience with loan defaults in some sectors; and (ii) mergers and acquisitions

Governors Message

The Annual Performance Report of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) provides an opportunity to take
stock of institution’s performance and offer report of accountability to all stakeholders and public
at large. Like a number of central banks, SBP has legal mandate to perform multiple
functions. The principal mandate, however, is to secure monetary and financial stability and foster
a dynamic and sound financial system so as to achieve sustained and equitable economic growth
in the country.

In delivering these responsibilities, SBP has steadily transformed and strengthened itself over the
years to adapt modern approaches and modalities and international best practices in all principal
areas of its policy mandate and operations. In the annual report, SBP management and staff have
also attempted to capture the broad direction of structural reforms and policy debates underway in
the central bank as well as banking industry to serve better the economic and social requirements.

Qualitative Changes in Monetary Management

Serving its legal mandate of achieving price stability, while promoting sustainable economic
growth, SBP’s monetary policy has helped contain core inflation. In the last year, SBP brought
about substantive changes in the formulation, management and conduct of monetary policy. To
further strengthen monetary policy framework, SBP has streamlined formulation, synchronization
and implementation of monetary policy and is reviving financial programming and
macroeconomic modeling to help feed in broader economic developments in monetary policy
making process while ensuring consistency in monetary and macroeconomic framework. SBP
Central Board invoked Section 9A of the SBP Act, 1956 and imposed annual ceiling on
government borrowings and has also communicated to the Government its quarterly borrowing
limits. These changes in debt policy, leading to reduction in reliance on central bank borrowing,
should augur well for easing the monetary pressure, though ultimately scaling down of
Government borrowings from banking system would be more desirable and would minimize
crowding out of private credit.

Besides using standard tools, like adjustment in reserve ratios and increase in policy discount rate,
SBP has proactively pursued Open Market Operations (OMOs) to mop up excess liquidity from
the banking system. Monetary tightening yielded results while the aggregate demand pressures
were contained and the core inflation (refers to non food non energy inflation) declined from 7.1%
to 5.7%. Despite the high and rising level of external current account deficit, SBP exchange rate
remained stable during FY07.

Monetary policy formulation process has also considerably benefited from the formation of a
more comprehensive Monetary Policy Committee within central bank and replacement of the
National Credit Consultative Council with a Private Sector Credit Advisory Committee. Other

State Bank grants Banking

Licence to Barclays Bank

The State Bank of Pakistan today granted a banking licence to Barclays Bank Plc,
UK to conduct banking business in Pakistan. Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, SBP
handed over the licence to Mr. Ahmed Khizer Khan, Chief Executive, Emerging Markets,
Global Retail and Commercial Banking, Barclays Bank at a simple ceremony held at
SBP, Karachi.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Akhtar said the entry of Barclays in Pakistan will
not only strengthen the banking system of the country but will also bring a significant
amount of foreign direct investment and technology to launch innovative financial
products.

The Governor highlighted the speed and efficiency with which both the SBP and
Barclays have concluded this deal. She added that given Barclays’ extensive network and
experience, she looks forward to Barclays as a partner in development of Pakistan which
will gear itself in due course to enhancing the competition and efficiency in the banking
system.

Dr Akhtar said the entry of Barclays in Pakistan reflects the confidence of foreign
banks in Pakistan’s banking system. She further said that in line with the recently
released Financial Stability Review, Pakistan’s banking system has illustrated its
capability to be strong and robust system which has great prospects and potential to grow
given the retail market of this country as captured by its population base and growing per
capita incomes. Pakistan’s banking assets in last 5 years have grown from Rs 2,223
billion to Rs 4,884 billion; advances from Rs 1,062 billion to Rs 2,603 billion; and
deposits from Rs 1,678 billion to Rs 3,691 billion, she added.

Head and Managing Director of Barclays in Pakistan.

Barclays will be established in Pakistan as a foreign banking company and
operate in branch mode with a capital of US$100 million and will initially set up 10
branches in various cities of the country. The issuance of licence to Barclays will add to
the presence of foreign banks. It will be the 7"" foreign bank operating in Pakistan in
branch mode in addition to a number of foreign banks having locally incorporated
subsidiaries. As per the agreements of the licence, Barclays will need to comply with the
SBP guidelines, if it plans for conversion of its status from branch mode to a local
subsidiary.

Barclays has established a track record of successful and sustainable banking
operations across the world. The Pakistani operations will benefit significantly from the
synergies and knowledge that Barclays, as one of the largest financial services providers,
can offer. Further, their presence in the market will translate into superior customer
service and also contribute to financial inclusion and modernization.

capital of US$68.138 billion, is a subsidiary company of Barclays Plc. Barclays Ple is

State Bank clarifies position on Rs1000/- Banknote

The State Bank of Pakistan has categorically denied reports published in a
section of the press today regarding the printing of Pakistani Flag in the colour of
Turkish Flag on Rs1000/- banknote.

It is clarified that Pakistani Flag does not appear on any of the banknote issued
by SBP. The crescent and five-pointed star appearing on the Rs1000/- banknote is
only the state of art security feature which changes the shade of ink when viewed
from different angles.

It may be pointed out that the crescent and five-pointed star surrounded in the
printing design of Optical Variable Ink (OVI) appear at the right on the obverse side
of the note. The OVI design changes colour from magenta to green and green to
magenta when the note is viewed from different angles.

The banknote of Rs5000/- is also equipped with the same security feature but
in this note the OVI design changes colour from green to golden and vice versa when
the note is viewed from different angles.

This feature is very effective in combating the counterfeiting of currency and
through this the genuineness of the high denomination banknote can easily be judged
by the general public.

It is pointed out that non-stapling of banknote packets is a current international
practice and the part of State Bank’s clean-note policy to enhance the life span of
banknotes by avoiding cutting and tearing up of banknotes while removing the
staples. The general public is supposed to count the notes before leaving the bank
counters. Banks are also required to make good the shortages of banknotes when
pointed out at the time of receiving notes by the customers.

It may be added here that under the State Bank Act 1956, the design, form and
material of the Banknotes issued by the State Bank are approved by the Federal

Government and the Cabinet Sub-committee.

Secured Transactions Framework in Pakistan

The State Bank of Pakistan, in collaboration with the International Securities Consultancy
Limited (ISC), Hong Kong, organized a one-day awareness and consensus building workshop on
Strengthening Secured Transaction Regime in Pakistan at Karachi.

The objective of the workshop was to familiarize the participants about the international best
practices in secured transactions and the initiatives of Government of Pakistan and SBP to
reform the secured transaction registry system in Pakistan with the view to get stakeholder
feedback on the work being carried out by the ISC consultants. The secured transactions
framework will help increase SME and Agriculture sectors’ access to finance by creating a
registry system to register charge on various kinds of properties, especially immovable
properties.

Chaired by Mr. Qasim Nawaz, Director SME & Microfinance Department, SBP, the workshop
was attended by bankers, officials of the federal and provincial governments as well as officials
of NADRA and CDC (Central Depository Company). The ISC Consultants Prof. Ron Harmer and
Ms. Elaine MacEachern speaking on the occasion apprised the participants about the
international best practices in Secured Transactions and emphasized on the need of
establishing secured transaction registry system in Pakistan that can facilitate the creation and
enforcement of collateral interest in movable and immovable assets by improving policies, laws
and regulations.

The Strengthening Secured Transaction Framework Project is being funded by the ADB under its
Technical Assistance (TA) Program for Pakistan. The Ministry of Finance is the Executing Agency,
while SBP is the Implementing Agency for this TA project along with the consultancy firm, ISC,

Recent International Financial Markets Turmoil
is a Wakeup Call: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan said today that the recent
turmoil in the global financial markets is a wake up call for leading financial market
centers to reassess their legal and regulatory framework.

Delivering her keynote address on ‘Reflections on Global Economic and
Financial Developments’ at the 57"" Annual General Meeting of the Institute of Bankers,
Pakistan (IBP) in Karachi, Dr Akhtar said there is now a broad consensus that this
financial turmoil stemmed from a liquidity crunch and has sharpened financial
vulnerabilities globally. She said given the intensity of financial market turmoil, there
have been concerns regarding its implications for inducing economic slowdown
particularly in the U.S. markets where housing slowdown is estimated to have already
chopped off close to half or quarter of US GDP growth.

The SBP Governor said the Federal Reserve took the extraordinary step to reduce
its key discount rate by 50 basis points. Although markets responded to this positively
with stock markets indexes registering growth, the easing of interest rates will boost
world economy with a laggard effect, she added.

Dr Akhtar said financial globalization, marked by growing cross-border flows and
strengthening of financial inter-linkages, has been on the rise. ‘This has been supported
by wave of financial and capital account liberalization worldwide accompanied by
financial engineering and innovation in the area of structured finance,’ she added.

She said the process of financial globalization has fostered economic growth and
efficiency as capital mobility has allowed flexibility to countries to meet their financing
requirements. At the same time, it allows investors with surplus capital to benefit from
international risk sharing opportunities and enjoying higher returns as a reward for higher
risk taking cross border, the Governor added.

Dr Akhtar opined that the central bankers have played a crucial role in
maintenance of macroeconomic stability through effective monetary tightening, while
nurturing healthy domestic financial markets that along with enhanced global monitoring
and vigilance has helped keep the global financial markets fairly robust and stable.

Notwithstanding, concerns have been echoed regarding global economic and
financial vulnerabilities, she said and added these concerns stemmed partly from the
continuous widening of global economic imbalances now for almost five years whereby
burgeoning US external current account deficit has also raised several questions.

The SBP Governor said that in order to promote global economic stability and an
orderly unwinding of these imbalances, the International Monetary Fund has now
launched a Multilateral Surveillance Mechanism while strengthening the bilateral
surveillance process with special focus on exchange rate surveillance.

Initially, there has been a debate whether the explosion of “Alternatives” defined
to include commodities, hedge funds, real estate and private equity, estimated by JP
Morgan to be close to $3 trillion as of 2006, would be creating the next bubble? Aside
from this, it has to be recognized that thus far signs of a bubble emerging appear in
energy commodities, she added.

STATE BANK RESTRUCTURES & RENAMES NCCC AS
PRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT ADVISORY COUNCIL (PSCAC)

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to restructure and rename the National
Credit Consultative Council (NCCC) as Private Sector Credit Advisory Council
(PSCAC). This has been done with a view to make the role of the new body more
effective and meaningful, consistent with the forces of free market economy.

The main objective of PSCAC will be to suggest ways and means to widen the
private sector’s access to credit with a view to promote economic development in
Pakistan. PSCAC will also review the developments related to credit availability to
private sector and suggest workable proposals to promote sectoral finance on sustainable
basis.

The PSCAC will not only identify impediments in credit availability and
disbursement for various purposes, including project finance, working capital finance,
infrastructure & housing finance, consumer finance, SME finance, microfinance, trade
finance, Islamic finance and other sectors but will also review the proposals of the
Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) relating to agricultural credit.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar will be the
Chairperson of PSCAC while its members will include representatives from banks,
private sector chambers/associations/trade bodies and concerned Government
ministries/institutions.

Adviser, Development Finance (SBP) will serve as Secretary of PSCAC. The
PSCAC will meet in April and October every year as the private sector credit cycle
usually begins in September-October and ends in March-April.

The representatives of the private sector and banks may be invited to PSCAC
meetings for presentations on issues relating to availability of credit and credit
disbursement respectively. The State Bank will issue a press release at the conclusion of
every meeting of PSCAC.

It may be recalled that the NCCC was constituted in September 1972 with the
mandate to draw up annual Credit Plan and to ensure optimal utilization of bank credit
through the process of directed credit to various sectors of the economy. However,
following the abolition of the system of credit ceiling and directed credit, the role of
NCCC was changed from regulatory or planning body to consultative/advisory body with
more focus on issues related to private sector credit. This necessitated the restructuring
and renaming of NCCC.

fresh currency notes before Eid-ul-Fitr, the State Bank of Pakistan has decided that all its
field offices and commercial banks’ branches throughout the country will issue one
packet each of Rs 10/- and Rs 20/- denominations fresh currency notes to one person
from their counters once during the Holy month of Ramazan.

SBP field offices have started issuing these currency notes from 2"" Ramazan-ul-
Mubarak (today) while commercial banks’ branches will issue fresh currency notes from
5"" of Ramazan till the last working day before Eid-ul-Fitr (or until the stock ends) on
production of original Computerized National Identity Card along with a copy of it for
record.

Commercial banks will also issue one packet each of these currency notes during
the above mentioned period to their account holders on production of cheques. However,
the account holders may also obtain packets of fresh currency notes in exchange of cash
on their written request. Moreover, the commercial banks will issue a maximum of five
packets each of Rs 10/- and Rs 20/- denominations fresh notes to corporates on receipt of
request on the company’s letter head duly signed by the authorized representatives.

These steps of the State Bank of Pakistan will help eliminate the black marketing

of fresh currency notes during the month of Ramazan.

State Bank, DFID to hold Regional Forum
on Financial Inclusion in February

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in collaboration with the UK’s Department for
International Development (DFID), will host a Regional Forum on Financial Inclusion in
Karachi from 14 to 15 February, 2008.

This is for the first time that such a high-level Forum on Financial Inclusion is being
held in Pakistan. Governors of the Central Banks/Heads of Financial Regulatory Authorities
from the member countries of South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, as well as
the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand will participate in
the Forum.

The Forum on Financial Inclusion will be primarily a consultative body for the
Governors of the Central Banks / Heads of Financial Regulatory Authorities of the Forum
countries, but will also invite financial inclusion experts from across the globe to draw from
international best practice. The expected outcomes of the Forum include the formation of a
Regional Consultative Group on Financial Inclusion Policy.

The significance of this event is reflected in the fact that the World Economic Forum
2008 has also dedicated a session to Financial Inclusion. The Regional Forum will thus
provide an opportunity to further develop policy guidelines in the regional context, taking its
cue from the discussions held at the World Economic Forum.

South Asia is home to over two billion people, with promising population dynamics
offering strong potential to become a major economic force in the world. However, high
levels of poverty have been a major barrier to sustainable growth in these countries. Greater
financial inclusion would accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty, but this requires a
concerted and sustained effort by policy makers and the private sector. The Forum will be an
opportunity for sharing experiences, enhancing coordination, and creating synergies.

Developing an inclusive financial sector is increasingly becoming a policy priority for
both developed and emerging economies. The substantially high proportion of people
without access to financial services in many developing countries is widely recognized as
one of the fundamental constraints in achieving sustainable economic growth. High levels of
financial exclusion and the weak financial sectors that tend to be associated with such

exclusion also hinder private sector development, lowering investment and trade.

HIGHLIGHTS

= Monetary policy measures adopted in July 2006 augmented earlier tightening and reduced
YoY core inflation (Non-Food Non-Energy — NFNE) to 5.5 percent by December 2006
from 7.4 percent a year earlier. However, the headline inflation remained stubbornly high
at 8.9 percent by December 2006.

= Although non-food inflation declined to 6.2 percent, acceleration in food inflation to
double-digit levels offset the downtrend in headline inflation.

= The impact of monetary tightening is visible from an upward movement in Monetary
Conditions Index (MCI) during H1-FY07.

= In line with its dual objective of balancing growth and price stability, monetary policy has
also supported economic growth by ensuring effective liquidity management as well as
providing adequate and timely concessional credit to priority sectors. Specifically, the
liberal access of concessional Long-term Financing for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-
EOP) offered by SBP and reduced rates on Export Finance Scheme (EFS) were helpful in
keeping the textile industry’s growth prospects intact.

= Concessional financing by SBP, nevertheless, has contributed significantly to growth of
reserve money during H1-FY07. The reserve money increased by 19.0 percent during
H1-FY07 compared to the 8.4 percent growth recorded in the corresponding period last
year; credit under EFS and LTF-EOP together explained around 54 percent of the
absolute change in reserve money in H1-FY07 over H1-FY06. Asa result, risks of
emerging day-to-day excess liquidity seem to have increased in the money market.

= Another source of reserve money expansion has been the build up in Net Foreign Assets
(NFA) during H1-FY07 in contrast with a depletion during H1-FY06. Hence, a policy
action to help smooth out liquidity management by scheduled banks is in order.

= While keeping the average weekly cash reserve requirement same as before (3 percent for
time and 7 percent for demand liabilities), SBP is increasing daily minimum requirements
to 2 percent and 6 percent for time and demand liabilities (from earlier levels of 1 percent
and 4 percent) respectively.

= Key challenges facing the Pakistan economy remain the same as were at the beginning of
FY07. In particular, (a) while inflation is likely to ease-off further it may remain above
the 6.5 percent target for FY07 unless some additional administrative measures are taken
to reduce food inflation; (b) international commodity prices may exert pressure on
domestic inflation; (c) reserve money growth is increasing, among others because of
textile sector support which is backed by SBP refinancing; (d) expansionary fiscal stance
coupled with occasional upsurges in borrowings from SBP and the uncertainty created by
financing mix of the deficit is posing difficulties for the conduct of monetary policy; and
(e) burgeoning external imbalances also continue to pose a challenge.

= SBP will continue to pursue its existing tight monetary policy stance during the remaining
half of FY07. It will, however, remain vigilant of the developments in the economy and
take corrective actions, if warranted.

State Bank issues draft
“Branchless Banking Guidelines”

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar today announced the
launching of Branchless Banking (BB) by using delivery channels like retail agents, mobile
phones etc. This represents a significantly cheaper alternative to conventional branch-based
banking and allows financial institutions and other commercial players to offer financial services
outside traditional banks’ premises. BB can be used to substantially increase the financial
services outreach to the un-banked communities. Provision of enabling regulatory environment
by careful risk-reward balancing is necessary to use such models.

In line with its responsibility to promote financial inclusion without risking the safety and
soundness of the banking system, the State Bank issued a policy paper on regulatory framework
for mobile banking in Pakistan which stipulated SBP’s strategy for promoting branchless
banking in Pakistan. SBP has now prepared draft guidelines as part of the broader strategy to
create enabling regulatory environment to promote Bank-led Model of branchless banking and
sought comments from all the stakeholders. The primary audiences of these draft guidelines are
financial institutions (Commercial Banks, Islamic Banks, Microfinance Banks and Development
Finance Institutions) desirous to undertake branchless banking. However, as financial institutions
cannot take on BB without the help of other market players like telecom companies, technology
service providers, agents etc., the comments of such other parties on the draft will also be
welcomed.

These draft guidelines outline permissible branchless banking activities and necessary
requirements and procedures for conducting these activities. Guidelines also contain sections
defining key roles and responsibilities, use of agents for conducting branchless banking activities
(including cash deposit and withdrawal), use of third party service providers, data & network
security, risk management program and customer protection and awareness. A salient feature of
these guidelines is the introduction of ‘Risk Based Customer Due Diligence (CDD)’ which
rationalizes the KYC/CDD requirements with the levels of risk exposures.

As part of its consultative approach and to take all stakeholders in confidence, SBP has
asked for feedback/comments on these guidelines by December 10, 2007. Detailed Guidelines
are available on SBP website: www.sbp.org.pk. State Bank plans to finalize these guidelines by
December 31, 2007.

2006-07. Total disbursements reached Rs 168.3 billion — representing -22.4% growth
over the preceding year disbursement of Rs137.5 billion and exceeding the actual target
of Rs160 billion.

While chairing the annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee
held in Karachi today, Dr Akhtar commended all those banks that played a significant
role in achieving the target.

The big five commercial banks namely Allied Bank Ltd., Habib Bank Ltd., MCB
Bank, National Bank of Pakistan and United Bank Ltd. as a group disbursed a total of
Rs80.2 billion, against the full-year target of Rs80 billion. Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd.
(ZTBL), Punjab Provincial Co-operative Bank Ltd. (PPCBL) and domestic private banks
(DPBs) disbursed Rs56.3 billion, Rs7.9 billion and Rs23.8 billion, respectively against
the target of Rs48 billion, Rs9 billion and Rs23 billion.

The Committee noted the significant rise in credit and its absorptive capacity in
Punjab as its provincial government has created a good enabling environment and
developed proper institutional arrangement for promoting credit delivery. Other
provinces can draw some important lessons from this province in setting a supportive
credit delivery environment.

For FY2007/2008, the Committee recommended the target of Rs200 billion for
credit disbursement to farmers. This assumes combined lending of Rs132 billion from
commercial banks and Rs68 billion for specialized institutions i.e. ZTBL & PPCBL. The
Committee also recommended province-wise allocations of disbursements, based on the
cropped area and absorption capacity of each province, Azad Jammu & Kashmir and
Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

During the meeting, Dr Akhtar constituted following Committees to lay down
additional ground work critical to be supportive of transformation of Pakistan’s rural
development. These Committees would focus on

(i) development of agricultural data base in conformity with international
standards and development of methodology for proper estimation of the
agriculture and rural credit requirements of the country in conformity with the
overall agricultural production as set by the respective ministries;

(ii) preparing a holistic development strategy for enhancing rural financing
whereby the development programs launched by federal and provincial
ministries would be supportive of facilitating effective intermediation of
agriculture and rural credit delivery; and

(iii) to develop guidelines for lending technology and supportive credit
enhancement mechanisms.

STATE BANK ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR FISHERIES
FINANCING TO BANKS/FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued ‘Guidelines for Fisheries Financing’ to facilitate and
encourage the banks/financial institutions (FIs) to enhance the flow of credit to the fisheries
sector.

These guidelines, which have been developed in consultation with key stakeholders
including fisheries departments, fishermen cooperative societies, chambers of
agriculture, farmers’ associations, agriculture research institutions, banks/financial
institutions and Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MINFAL), cover all areas
of fisheries financing business.

The guidelines are part of SBP’s initiatives to increase the flow of credit to agriculture
sector with a view to supplement government’s efforts to develop this sector for
poverty alleviation and to create an enabling environment for the banks to adopt
agriculture credit as viable business line.

These policy initiatives, inter alia, include: Standardized and Simplified Agricultural Credit
Documents, Revolving Credit Scheme for Agricultural Production Loans, Prudential
Regulations for Agricultural Financing, Capacity Building of Banks through Training &
Special Outreach Programs, Revision of Report for Estimation of Agricultural Credit
Requirements, issuance of Guidelines for Livestock Financing etc.

Banks may adopt the guidelines in the present form or with some adjustments to suit their
organizational & operational needs and market characteristics, subject to compliance with
SBP Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing. Banks are also encouraged to develop
new products and mechanism like target market analysis, development of financing products,
procedures for product marketing, delivery & monitoring mechanism, follow-up & recovery
and monitoring growth trends.

It may be pointed out that Pakistan, with a coastline of more than 1000 km and a total
area of approximately 0.25 million sq. km of marine and 0.08 million sq. km of inland
waters, has great potential for the development of fisheries that can play a significant
role in the national economy by contributing towards food security of the country,
reducing pressure on demand for mutton, beef and poultry.

It may be added here that the fisheries sector is providing direct employment to about
379,000 fishermen and 400,000 people are employed in ancillary industries. It has a domestic
consumption potential of one million metric tons and export of US$1 billion, annually.
However, the flow of bank credit to this sector is negligible i.e. 0.4% of the total agricultural
credit disbursement.

Complete Guidelines for Fisheries Financing are available at SBP website: www.sbp.org.pk

ACAC REVIEWS THE DISBURSEMENT OF CREDIT TO THE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FY07.

The mid-term meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
was held in Karachi with Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar in the
chair, to review the disbursement of agriculture credit to the farmers during the first half
of the fiscal year 2006-07.

The Committee was informed that the banks during July-December, 2006
disbursed Rs 72 billion to the agriculture sector which is 16% higher than the
disbursements of Rs 62 billion during the same period last year. Bank-wise break-up
revealed that five big banks (NBP, HBL, UBL, MCB Bank & ABL) as a group disbursed
Rs 34.3 billion, ZTBL, Rs 24.2 billion, PPCBL Rs 3.0 billion and Domestic Private
Banks (DPBs) Rs 10.2 billion during the six months ended December, 2006 as against
Rs 33.5 billion, Rs 19.3 billion, Rs 2.0 billion and Rs 7.1 billion respectively during the
same period last year.

The Committee expressed its concern that the disbursement covered about 45% of
SBP targets for fiscal year 2006-07 as against 48% covered in the corresponding period
last year. The achievements of banks during July-December 2006 revealed that five big
banks as a group achieved about 43%, ZTBL 50%, PPCBL 33% and the Domestic
Private Banks as a group achieved 44% of their annual targets as against 53%, 45%, 22%
and 48% of the last year’s achievements respectively.

The ACAC noted that out of the total disbursements, farm sector got a share of
87% whereas non-farm sector had a share of only 13%. Livestock, dairy farming and
poultry having an important role in poverty reduction, received 12% of the total
disbursement as against the target of 15%.

The SBP Governor while expressing dissatisfaction over the slower growth in
disbursement of credit to the agriculture sector impressed upon the banks to take
necessary steps to accelerate the pace of credit disbursement to the agriculture sector
during the coming months so that the full year target of Rs.160 billion should be
achieved. She also expressed her concern over the dismal performance of some banks
regarding agriculture credit disbursements. She asked the heads of banks to submit their
action plans to her to overcome the shortfall and to meet their annual disbursement
targets.

Dr. Shamshad Akhtar stressed upon the banks to formulate a long-term vision and
strategy to develop agriculture finance as a viable business line. She stressed the need for
creating a conducive environment for increasing the credit outreach. She said that the
need for developing an enabling environment for increasing the flow of credit was

State Bank’s Significant
Role in Textile Industry’s Development

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has consistently lent a helping hand to
the textile industry due to its strategic significance and contribution to the
overall industrial output, exports and employment generation.

In the post-quota regime, the State Bank’s support for the textile
industry has been extensive and substantive recognizing the intense
international competition faced by the industry.

Latest SBP exchange figures indicate that textile exports for July-
March FY07 have grown by 10.3%. While in the first few months of FY07
textile exports grew somewhat slowly, it seems to have gained momentum in
the last 5 months when the average growth recorded was 11.63%. The
composition of exports reflects that exports of yarn, knitwear, towels,
synthetic textiles and made-up articles have picked up but few other categories
such as cotton cloth, bed wear, and ready-made garments are growing slowly.

At the start of FY07, based on the suggestions from different textile
bodies, the State Bank agreed to provide higher level of interest rate subsidy
on export financing and long-term financing for exports. Currently, the
financing facilities to exporters under the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) are
being offered for a six-month period at 7.5% which is around 3% below six-
month Karachi Inter Bank Offered Rate (KIBOR), and facilities for import of
eligible machinery for a period of up to 3 years under SBP’s Scheme for Long
Term Financing for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP) are being offered to
exporters in the range of 5% below the KIBOR of relevant maturities.
Similarly, financing facilities under LTF-EOP for up to 7-1/2 years are
available to exporters at 7.0%.

Total gross disbursement from refinancing facility allowed to
banks during July 2006 to April 21, 2007 under EFS and LTF-EOP is
estimated to be Rs 328 billion of which EFS flows were Rs 284 billion.

It may be pointed out that while providing these incentives, the
State Bank has always underscored that the country’s financial sector offers
fairly competitive financing to textile industry and real interest rates in the
country are lower than its regional and competitive partners. This has been
further confirmed by an independent report of a consultant hired by the
Government.

It is significant to note that FY07 reflects record high-level
refinancing support ever provided by the State Bank. This refinancing has had
few consequences:

First, refinancing being a creation of new money has an impact on
growth of high-powered money. Growth in textile refinancing (LTF-EOP) of
Rs 43.8 billion for July-April 07 (relative to Rs.6.7 billion for preceding year)

MICROFINANCE OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE
WITHOUT SUBSIDIES: PROF. YUNUS

Microfinance operations can be run on sustainable basis without subsidies. This
was stated by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Prof. Muhammad Yunus, in an interactive
seminar held at State Bank of Pakistan today.

Prof. Yunus, who is the Managing Director of Grameen Bank, said that the
provision of financial services to the poor is doable as has been demonstrated by
Grameen Bank serving 7 million poor customers on sustainable basis. This requires
determination, imagination and hard work, he added.

Prof. Yunus shared Grameen Bank’s success story, the obstacles and constraints
faced, and the current outreach and sustainability numbers. He pointed out that a
commercial enterprise works on the principle of maximizing profits, while a social
business enterprise exists to serve a cause on the basis of cost coverage, reasonable rate
of return and retention of profits.

In order to provide financial services to the poor, enabling them to participate and
exploit economic opportunities, Prof. Yunus said that microfinance may be viewed as a
social business enterprise that serves a cause, covers the costs and also earns a reasonable
rate of return.

He said that in order to give necessary boost to the microfinance sector, the
commercial banks with their vast network, stable funding sources and handsome profits
may start microfinance subsidiaries and branches on social business enterprise principle.

Prof. Yunus also offered services of Grameen Bank on “Build, Operate and
Transfer” (BOT) basis, whereby Grameen Bank can establish model branches, systems,
procedures and make the business up and running before handing over to the initiating
bank.

Earlier, in his welcome address, the Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Mr. Mansur-ur-Rehman Khan said that the State Bank was playing a pro-active role in
setting up, nurturing and promoting microfinance institutions (MFIs). The microfinance
sector is the largest sector in Pakistan in terms of potential clientele base comprising
more than 25 to 30 million poor people, he added. Nevertheless, he pointed out that the
microfinance market in Pakistan is underdeveloped having less than 4% outreach, narrow
institutional base and limited retail capacity due to Pakistan’s late entry in the
microfinance sector.

“With the collaboration of microfinance stakeholders, we have developed a
National Strategy for Microfinance,’ he added. Mr. Mansur said that the number of
microfinance borrowers is likely to reach three million from existing one million within
next 2-3 years.

Mr. Azhar Iqbal Kureshi, Executive Director, Development Finance, SBP
presented the vote of thanks while Mr. Zulfikar Khokhar, Joint Director SMEs and
Microfinance Department, SBP presented an overview of microfinance sector in

STATE BANK ISSUES DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR POULTRY FINANCING

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued ‘Draft Guidelines for Poultry Financing’ to
banks/Financial Institutions (FIs) and other stakeholders for their feedback / comments. The
guidelines will facilitate and encourage Banks / FIs in enhancing the credit flow to the poultry
sector. They cover all areas of the poultry industry including hatchery sector, poultry farming
and feed manufacturing. Draft guidelines also cover poultry financing business including
purposes and objectives of the loan, eligibility of borrowers, types of financing, fixation of loan
limit & repayment terms, loan monitoring mechanism, etc.

All the stakeholders are advised to submit their feedback/comments/suggestions through surface
mail, email or fax messages within 15 days from today (i.e. upto 30"" November, 2007) to the
Director, Agricultural Credit Department, State Bank of Pakistan, I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi

(email ashraf.khan@sbp.org.pk, Fax: 9217215).

Poultry is an important sub-sector of agriculture. It has great potential and can play a significant
role in the national economy by contributing towards food security of the country, reducing
pressure on demand for mutton and beef and earning of foreign exchange. Its contribution to
meat production is 20 percent and has a share of around 4.8% in agriculture GDP, and around 1.5
million people are connected with this field.

The main objectives of Guidelines are:

¢ To facilitate banks in developing internal expertise & products for poultry financing.

¢ To encourage & facilitate financial sector to provide needed working capital and term
finance to poultry sector.

¢ To encourage farmers to adopt modern and efficient poultry farming techniques.

¢ To encourage increased poultry meat/ poultry food production for local consumption.

¢ To promote export of poultry meat/ poultry food and its processed products.

Once the final guidelines will be issued, banks may develop new products on the basis of (a)
target market analysis, its characteristics, size, trends, growth potential, etc; (b) development of
financing products; (c) developing procedures for product marketing, delivery and monitoring
mechanism, follow-up and recovery; (d) monitoring growth trends and quality of the portfolio
and to develop close liaison with the field force to have feedback from the grass roots level; and
(e) review developments taking place in the poultry sector within the country as well as in other
parts of the world.

The draft guidelines have also been released on State Bank website at www.sbp.org.pk.

It may be pointed out that the SBP has already issued guidelines on livestock and fisheries
financing to the banks for the diversification of agricultural credit to non-crop sector.

STATE BANK INTRODUCES STRATEGIC CHANGES IN
MONETARY POLICY FORMULATION: DR AKHTAR

The State Bank of Pakistan issued its Monetary Policy Statement for the first half of
FY08, which was approved by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting
held in Karachi today, with Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar in the Chair.

The State Bank Governor briefed the newsmen about the salient features of the
Monetary Policy at a press conference held after the Board meeting. The Governor,
State Bank of Pakistan said that despite the risks and challenges identified for FY08
and the carry forward stress of monetary developments of FY07, SBP is determined to
achieve the CPI inflation target of 6.5 percent in FY08. Therefore, SBP would
actively make use of its policy instruments to bring CPI inflation down to its target
level, she added.

Dr Akhtar said that keeping in view the challenges and allowing greater scope for
private sector credit growth, SBP has introduced some strategic changes in monetary
policy formulation and its conduct. Monetary policy is undergoing qualitative changes
following the abandonment of the Annual Credit Plan (which prescribed targets for
broad monetary aggregates) and recognition that there is a need for adopting a more
sustainable approach to deal with the two principal sources of reserve money growth,
ie., the government’s reliance on central bank borrowings and the refinancing
operations which dilute the central bank’s monetary stance, she added.

The SBP Governor said in line with this monetary policy framework and assuming
real GDP growth target of 7.2 percent and inflation target of 6.5 percent, broad money
supply growth should be 13.7 percent for FY08.

She said the State Bank has recommended to the Government that for FY08 it would
be prudent to: (i) retire borrowings from SBP by Rs 62.3 billion, (ii) adopt quarterly
ceilings on budget borrowings from SBP, and (iii) adopt a more balanced domestic
debt strategy whereby budget is financed from long-term financing sources (that are
relatively less inflationary).

Another significant strategic change in the monetary policy is SBP’s decision to
gradually reduce commercial banks’ reliance on refinancing facilities and encourage
them to mobilize the desired level of resources to fully accommodate private sector
and export credit requirement, the Governor added.

The following are the policy measures announced in the Monetary Policy Statement:

i ective from ugust will raise policy discount rate from 9.
i) Effective fi 1° August 2007 SBP will raise policy di f 9.5
percent to 10 percent.

(ii) Zero rating of Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for all deposits of one-year
and above maturity (to encourage greater resource mobilization of longer
tenor) and 7 percent CRR for other demand and time liabilities.

PAKISTAN’S BANKING SYSTEM REMAINS UNHURT
BY RECENT FINANCIAL MARKET TURMOIL: DR AKHTAR

The banking system of Pakistan has escaped the major ravaging effects of recent financial
market turmoil emerging from US and engulfing the developed European economies. This
was stated by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar while speaking at
The Asian Banker Dialogue on “The Banks We Like and the Impact of the Global Financial
Crisis on Pakistan’s Banks” at a local hotel in Karachi today.

However, she observed: ‘In my assessment, Pakistan’s economy to date has been affected
mainly by the indirect impact of global events which led to the rise in the global commodity
prices.’ Pakistan is perhaps the worst hit economy by the surge in global commodity prices
as it has been a predominant factor in derailing the macroeconomic fundamentals, she
remarked. Citing an example to explain this situation, she said that almost 80% of the
external current account deficit in FY08 is equivalent to the import oil bill which shot up to
over $11 billion in FY08 as compared to below $3 billion a few years back. Similarly, a
large increase in FY08 fiscal deficit is on account of delay in pass through of the
international price hike at retail level, she observed.

Dr Akhtar said the financial markets in Pakistan have not been hit by the subprime markets
or the associated contagion directly as Pakistan’s banking system from July 2007 to
September 2008 did not face any liquidity problems. With the strong regulatory oversight,
we have seen significant enhancement of capital and capital adequacy ratio supported by
high provisioning requirements. The Governor said that in July 2008, the State Bank of
Pakistan has launched far reaching financial sector reforms to lay foundations for further
enhancing the robustness of the financial system to cope with the emerging challenges.

Elaborating further, she said that the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system is strong
ie. 12.1 percent (in June-08) — well above the internationally acceptable minimum
requirement of 8 percent. Also, core capital constitutes about 80 percent of the total capital
and Tier 1 to risk weighted assets ratio of the banking system is at 9.7 percent — well
exceeding the 4 percent minimum international standard.

As of October 4, 2008, the balance sheet footing of our banking system is around Rs5.1
trillion while loans and deposits of the banking system are around Rs2.8 trillion and Rs3.8
trillion respectively, she added.

In its communications to the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA), the State Bank has advised
the banks to act prudently in sharing the liquidity in the system and ensure that call rates
reflect the fundamentals in the money market, she added. Dr Akhtar said that SBP on its part
has injected regular liquidity in the financial system and since August 2008, conducted

Dr Shamshad Akhtar receives the Best
Central Bank Governor of the Year Award

Senior Editor, The Banker Magazine, Ms. Karina Robinson presented the Central
Bank Governor of the Year in Asia 2008 Award to the State Bank Governor,
Dr Shamshad Akhtar at a simple but impressive ceremony held at a local hotel in Karachi
today.

Speaking on the occasion, Ms Robinson paid glowing tributes to the SBP
Governor. She said Dr Akhtar has been able to restructure many aspects of the economy
and implement many new policies in the banking sector, including an important financial
inclusion strategy. She said Dr Akhtar managed to tighten monetary policy and through
decisive action was successful in 2006 and 2007 in sustaining a downward trend in
inflationary pressures while facilitating record strong growth in the economy. Monetary
tightening has had the important impact of maintaining hard-won macroeconomic
stability that has encouraged increased investment flows, she added.

She said another important central bank strategy shift has been the decision to
gradually reduce commercial banks’ reliance on refinancing facilities and encourage
banks to fully accommodate private sector and export credit requirements, thereby
helping the private sector. Ms Robinson said Dr Akhtar believes there is a high degree of
financial exclusion and she has outlined a comprehensive strategy to improve access to
financial services to the poor through a far-reaching microfinance development plan and
the expansion of branch networks and Islamic banking in underserved areas.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Akhtar said that it was not only an honor for her but
for the country also, which now has an efficient financial system. She said the banking
sector reforms have brought in competition within the system, improved internal
efficiency and broadened access to the middle class. She said that these reforms would
not have been possible without the cooperation of the chief executives of banks.

Dr Akhtar also thanked The Banker Magazine for bestowing this prestigious
award to her. She said that by continuation of the financial sector reforms, the country
would be able to reduce poverty significantly in the years ahead.

The ceremony arranged by The Banker Magazine, a subsidiary of the prestigious
and renowned newspaper, Financial Times of London, was attended, among others, by
Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor, Mr Asad Qureshi, Executive Director and Mr Riaz
Riazuddin, Economic Advisor of SBP, besides Chief Executives of commercial
banks/multinational firms and notable industrialists.

It may be recalled that the last year Dr Akhtar was conferred with the ‘Best
Central Bank Governor for Asia 2007’ award in recognition of her outstanding
contribution in the overall financial sector and monetary policy management in Pakistan
by Emerging Markets Newspaper, a part of Euromoney Institutional Investor plc, one of
the largest and most respected providers of financial information worldwide.

SBP grants record number of
730 branch licenses in 2008

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued 730 licenses to commercial banks to
open new branches/sub-branches in calendar year 2008 under its Branch Licensing
Policy (BLP). This is the highest ever number of licenses given by the State Bank in any
year.

In 2007, the State Bank issued a total of 474 branch licenses. As of Dec. 16,
2008 the total number of bank branches operating in the country was 8,886. It may be
mentioned that under BLP, commercial banks which want to open new places of
business during a calendar year are required to submit their Annual Branch Expansion
Plan (ABEP) to the State Bank for consideration and approval. Accordingly, various
banks submitted their ABEP-2008 and were granted approval for opening of branches.

As required under the BLP, banks are required to open at least 20% of their
branches in rural/under-served areas (RUAs). RUAs mean villages, small towns and
also include those Tehsil Headquarters where there is no branch of any bank.

Accordingly, in 2008 a total of 144 branch licenses have been issued for
opening branches in RUAs that exceeds the mandatory requirement of opening of
20%. The locations identified by banks for opening of new branches are well
diversified throughout the country covering all the four provinces of Pakistan,
Northern Areas, Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Islamabad.

In addition, a total of 178 licenses for opening of sub-branches have been
granted in 2008 while 408 licenses were granted to open up branches in urban areas.
A total of 30 banks were granted permission by the State Bank to open new
branches/sub-branches in 2008. Highest number of 66 licenses were granted to
Banklslami, followed by Meezan Bank 61 and 55 each to Askari Bank and United Bank
Ltd. Other prominent banks which were given branch/sub-branch licenses in 2008
include Bank Al Falah 51, Bank Al Habib 50, KASB Bank 38, Emirates Global Islamic
Bank 30, MCB Bank 30, JS Bank 30, Soneri Bank 28, Faysal Bank 25, Arif Habib Bank 21,
My Bank 20, National Bank 19, Habib Bank 18, Kashf Microfinance Bank 18, Dawood
Islamic Bank 16, Atlas Bank 15, Allied Bank 14, AlBaraka Islamic Bank 12, Habib
Metropolitan Bank 10, The First Microfinance Bank 10 and miscellaneous 38.

It may be pointed out that branch network of Islamic banking institutions also
crossed an important milestone of 500 branches in December 2008. The total branch
network of Islamic banking institutions now consists of 506 branches including 70 sub-
branches. In December 2007, total branches of Islamic banking institutions were 289
and during this year 217 new outlets have been opened by Islamic banking
institutions. This impressive growth is a proof of resilience of Islamic banking industry
in Pakistan, which would be helpful in achieving the cherished target of 12% market
share by Islamic banking till 2012 as envisaged in Strategic Plan announced by the
State Bank.

State Bank assesses economic situation;

doesn’t revise targets of key economic variables

Director, Economic Analysis Department, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Mohammad
Mansoor Ali said today the State Bank only provides analyses of country’s macro-economic
situation and does not set/revise key economic benchmarks.

He was responding to remarks/comments made by various television channels and print
media on the State Bank’s second-quarterly report in which it was wrongly implied that the
annual gross domestic product growth and inflation targets were revised by the central bank.

Explaining the SBP position, he pointed out that the second-quarterly report only
presented the SBP’s assessment of the developments in the economy, which suggested that
many of the annual economic targets might not be achieved. He said that the assertion made
by the central bank in its report did not indicate, in any way, that economic targets had been
revised. He further clarified that revising economic targets was a prerogative that rested with
the Federal Government.

Responding to comments made by the President of Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce & Industry recently, Mr. Mansoor said that it is wrong to say that the State Bank has
revised the inflation target. He pointed out that the economic indicators benchmarks were set
by the Planning Commission and the SBP was only making its assessments. The SBP forecast
indicated that the inflation target for FYO8 might not be met easily.

Further, Mr. Mansoor said that the FPCCI president was correct to ask for “bridging of
the demand-supply gaps” to control inflation and added that continued monetary tightening by
the State Bank was serving precisely this purpose. Specifically, the monetary control exercised
by the SBP is helping to prevent inflationary pressures from getting out of control, he added.

Pakistan’s Banking Sector is resilient: Dr Akhtar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has said that Pakistan’s banking
sector is quite resilient and has been and will be able to withstand different types of market
shocks and adverse macro economic conditions. This capability has been achieved through
continuous financial reform process distinctively pursued during the past few years. There
should not be any cause for concern about the stability of the banking system in the coming
days, she added.

In a press statement issued today, she pointed out that the banking system shows strong
performance and holds a promising outlook, the investors maintained their confidence in the
banking system and injected additional capital of around $500 million since 2006 that coupled
with retained earnings improved the capital base of the banks.

Dr Akhtar said that the banking sector has strong capital adequacy well above the minimum
requirement. The capital adequacy ratio of the system is 12.1% as of June 08 that is well above
the international benchmark. The nonperforming loans ratio and the ratio of non-performing
loans to capital are also quite low and within acceptable ranges. “The infection ratio (net) in June
2008 has improved to 1.1% from 1.6 % in Dec-2006, signifying that the banks set aside more reserves
out of their earnings to cover the increase in non-performing loans. Accordingly, the NPL coverage and
capital impairment ratios have also improved,” the SBP Governor added.

SBP Governor said that Pakistani banks largely focus on conventional lending and are not
exposed to subprime credit instruments in the international market. The lending and
investments of the banks are subject to the stringent prudential regulations of SBP that prohibit
the banks from clean lending and investment in low quality assets. Further, the banks are
required to recognize the loan losses and provide for these losses in line with the established
best practices. State Bank of Pakistan through its on-site inspection and off-site supervision
wings keeps a close watch on the state of each bank as well as the banking system in entirety
for any risk to the stability of the banking system.

In 2007, SBP made loan provisioning requirements more stringent in order to create adequate
cushions to withstand any potential credit adversity. Stress testing analysis of the system
suggests that the system is capable to withstand variety of plausible shocks in major risk factors
without losing its solvency, Dr Akhtar added.

She said that Pakistan’s banking system has been showing steady growth, satisfactory operating
performance, strong resilience towards major risk factors, and efficiency; reflecting upon the
strong fundamentals that the system has developed during financial sector’s reform process.

Dr Akhtar tells banks to expedite
repatriation of export proceeds

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today advised all
commercial banks to ensure repatriation of overdue export proceeds.

Addressing a meeting of heads of commercial banks held at State Bank of
Pakistan, Karachi, Dr Akhtar expressed concern over inability of banks to realize export
proceeds within the stipulated period of 180 days.

She recommended that banks should concentrate on encouraging exporters to
bring back over-due export proceeds, which are held-up for less than a year. “Banks
have to really act fast to ensure realization of approximately $200 - $220 million
overdue proceeds on which the State Bank staff will be working closely with them.”

SBP Governor underscored the need to devise a mechanism to segregate
between those exporters who have genuine problems and those who are not bringing
back export proceeds willfully. The State Bank and banks are to conduct analysis of
reasons for delays in export proceeds beyond one year and work out linkage between
held up export proceeds and Export Refinance. She also said that banks and the State
Bank should also develop a database of export proceeds region wise/customer wise in
order to expedite repatriation of the held up proceeds.

Representatives of the commercial banks assured the central bank that they will
make utmost efforts towards realization of export proceeds. They also agreed to have
another meeting with the Governor SBP after 15 days to report the progress in this

regard.

State Bank sets Rs 250 Blin agri credit target for FY09

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan said today that the central
bank has set an indicative credit disbursement target of Rs 250 billion for the agriculture
sector for the current 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9) which can be further enhanced after
having a detailed analysis of the rising input costs of the sector.

While chairing a meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC)
held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi, Dr Akhtar commended the performance of
banks that played a significant role in surpassing the target set for the last fiscal year.

Dr Akhtar informed the meeting that in 2007-08 banks have surpassed the
agriculture credit target of Rs 200 billion and disbursed Rs 212 billion to the farming
community which is higher by Rs 43 billion or 25% than the last year’s disbursement of
Rs 169 billion.

She said that keeping in view the growing requirements of the sector, the State
Bank has proposed an indicative target of Rs 250 billion for 2008-09, which is higher by
Rs 50 billion or 25% than last year’s target and Rs 38 billion or 18% higher than the
actual disbursements of FY08.

Dr Akhtar appreciated the fact that sector-wise agriculture credit disbursements
during the last fiscal year showed diversification of the credit to non-farm sector as its
share in the total credit disbursement increased to 25% in FY08 from 17% in FYO7. She
pointed out that recoveries of agriculture loans have shown significant improvement
during FY08 and banks recovered 92% of their recoverable amounts as against 83%
recovered during FYO7.

While responding to questions posed by representatives of three less developed
provinces on lower disbursement of agriculture loans to their respective provinces, the
SBP Governor said that the banks are making efforts which have resulted in increase in
the disbursements during the last couple of years. Delegates pointed out that there are
issues of credit absorption in these provinces because of low productivity, water salinity,
lack of good farming practices by the farmers and other issues that need to be
addressed by various provincial agriculture and extension services departments to
create enabling environment for banks to increase their outreach.

Dr Akhtar urged the representatives of the three provincial governments to take
necessary steps to address these issues and improve the coordination between
respective departments on fast-track basis to increase the flow of agriculture credit to
the less developed areas of the country.

SBP Governor launches Key Microfinance Sector Development Initiatives

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today launched important initiatives
for the growth and development of microfinance sector, at an event at SBP Karachi. The event was
attended by all stakeholders including donors, Presidents/CEOs of Commercial/Microfinance Banks,
and representatives of the Pakistan Microfinance Network and Pakistan Bankers Association.

These measures are expected to ease liquidity constraints of microfinance providers in view of the
tighter liquidity conditions and sudden spike in inflation which has severely affected the poor and
marginalized segments of the society. SBP has launched three facilities to support the microfinance
sector:

(i) The Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility;

(ii) The Institutional Strengthening Fund; and

(iii) The Improving Access to Finance Services Fund.

These initiatives are part of the GBP 50 million ‘Financial Inclusion Program’ (FIP) supported by the
UK Department for International Development (DFID) and an endowment fund worth US$ 20 million
under the ADB’s Improving Access to Financial Services Program.

The Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility is expected to increase the flow of credit to
microfinance sector. The facility aims to incentivize banks/DFls to channelize funds to MFBs/MFIs
for on lending to low income segment of the population. The facility will provide credit guarantees of
up to 40 percent of the funding provided by Banks/DFls and aims to develop market and graduate
poor borrowers to mainstream financial service providers. Banks/DFls will lend to MFBs at the SBP
policy discount rate plus 200 bps. The funds channelized under facility to MFBs /MFlIs shall be
deductable from Demand and Time Liabilities of the banks/DFls for the purpose of SLR and CRR
calculation.

The facility will be established at State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) with the help of the UK Government
Financial Inclusion Program grant funds equivalent of up to GBP 10 million to be used as the
guarantee fund. The State Bank has issued necessary guidelines for operationalizing the facility
which were finalized after due consultation with stakeholders.

Dr Akhtar announces Reforms Agenda for

Exchange Companies

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has announced the
blueprint of reforms being introduced in the Exchange Company Sector with a
view to (i) define more clearly the objectives and scope of exchange companies,
(ii) well capitalize the sector, and (iii) bring better market discipline through
enhanced transparency, disclosure and strong monitoring and supervision.
However, these measures will be introduced in a manner that promotes long-term
business interests in an effective and well-encompassing regulatory environment
while seeking to avoid potentially adverse near-term impacts on the service levels
of Exchange Companies for general public. This announcement was made by the
Governor during a meeting with the Heads of Exchange Companies held at the
State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today.

 

Dr Akhtar said that SBP has decided to change its approach from ‘bringing
financial discipline and corporate culture’ to ‘ensuring discipline and maximum
compliance’. In this respect SBP has reviewed the whole regime for exchange
companies with the objective of defining better role and responsibility of exchange
companies. On the enforcement side, the exchange companies should not expect
any leniency. SBP would not spare any company regardless of its market size to
establish the regulatory writ.

She announced that the State Bank is launching the second-phase reforms
for the exchange companies and will issue regulatory guidelines that will set in
motion corporate governance reforms for the exchange companies. A notice
regarding these reforms was issued to exchange companies in the last meeting
chaired by the Governor. “Our intention is to take you (exchange companies)
forward and to promote your businesses provided you abide by rules of business,”
she asserted. She also urged upon the exchange companies to seek mergers &
acquisitions so as to consolidate and strengthen the sector and increase its
efficiency.

While referring to recent speculative trends in the kerb market, Dr
Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has directed the exchange
companies to keep dollar-rupee parity differential between the Inter-Bank and
Kerb markets at rational levels, restrain from speculation and to focus on bringing
in home remittances into the country. “This differential should not be beyond
normal trends seen in the past,” she told exchange companies representatives.

Pakistan’s GDP growth to stay between

5.5%-6.0% range in FY08: SBP Report

Pakistan’s real Gross Domestic Product growth is likely to remain in the range of
5.5% to 6.0% in the current 2007-08 fiscal year (FY08), says the State Bank’s Third
Quarterly Report for the fiscal year 2007-08 (FY08) on the State of Pakistan’s Economy
which was released today.

The Report said that the country’s economy is witnessing some broad
deterioration in key macroeconomic indicators due to a combination of adverse domestic
and international developments, but it is important to note that the economy has
fundamentally gained resilience as a result of structural reforms and liberalization
measures over the last fifteen years.

The Report said that inherent resilience of the economy suggests that a policy
focus on regaining macroeconomic stability through further reforms, and corrective
measures could quickly reinvigorate the growth momentum of the economy.

The Report pointed that Real Gross Domestic Product growth in FY08 is expected
to drop below the 6 percent level for the first time in five years, annual inflation is poised
to return to double digits, the fiscal deficit is forecast to rise substantially, and the annual
current account deficit, as a percentage of GDP, is projected to be at an all-time high.

The Report said over the last 6 months, expansionary fiscal policy has
overshadowed and substantially weakened the impact of sustained monetary tightening
by the State Bank. This impact of the heavy government borrowings has been
particularly evident in FY08, with the borrowings rising to a record Rs 551.0 billion by
10"" May, 2008 (compared to only Rs 45.7 billion in the corresponding period of FY07),
almost doubling the total outstanding stock of borrowings to Rs 940.6 billion. “This
trend cannot be sustained without risking a substantial further acceleration in inflation,” it
added.

The Report advised that the government has to urgently address the growth of the
fiscal deficit as well as to diversify its financing away from the central bank. While
information on fiscal developments is only available for H1-FY08, SBP assessment
indicates that the Jul-Mar FY08 fiscal deficit (as a ratio of GDP) is likely to be greater
than the FY07 annual figure. The new government has indicated an intention to broaden
the tax base and rein-in expenditure growth in support of macroeconomic stability, it said
and added it has also indicated an intention to diversify the financing of the deficit and
reduce dependence on the central bank borrowings. “For the economy to retain its high
growth momentum, it is important that these goals are achieved,” the Report said.

It said removal of the excessive fiscal stimulus, the increase in administered
energy prices, the recent exchange rate adjustments and continued tight monetary stance
are expected to help correct the substantial increase in the country’s trade deficit. “This

correction is overdue,” it added.

Pakistan’s banking sector remarkably resilient despite
challenging economic environment: SBP’s Financial Stability Review

Pakistan’s banking sector has remained remarkably strong and resilient, despite facing
pressures emanating from weakening macroeconomic environment since late 2007, according
to the assessment of the State Bank of Pakistan’s Financial Stability Review 2007-08 released
today.

The Report said that given its bank-centric nature, the stability of the financial system is
derived essentially from the banking system. An assessment of the performance of the banking
sector from January 2007 to June 2008 shows that Pakistan’s banking system has over the years
nurtured itself such that it is able to withstand some of the shocks it has faced in the last 18
months or so.

“The banking system is on strong footing and has long term potential — a feature which
has served to attract a substantial amount of FDI in the sector, with established global financial
institutions now active participants in the domestic financial sector,” it said and added that it
has been well-governed and being in private hands under professional management, has
witnessed outstanding financial performance during the last few years.

The Report states that with strong regulatory oversight, there has been a significant
enhancement of capital and risk-weighted capital adequacy, supported by high provisioning
requirements which were tightened in 2007. Stringent loan provisioning requirement has built
sufficient reserves against the NPLs’ portfolio. In contrast to the liberalized financial system in
the west which took its toll in the form of the current global financial crisis, there are stringent
regulations and adequate policies in place to help the banking system manage its risks.

It pointed out that aggregate financial soundness indicators have improved since early
2000, and continue to exhibit strong performance. “Tighter provisioning requirements may
have reduced profits, but have positioned banks well,” it said and added ongoing consolidation
and mergers have enabled a number of banks to position themselves better.

“Having observed the experiences of the global economy, the way forward for the
financial sector is to maintain both the simplicity and transparency of product structures and a
gradual pace of financial liberalization to enable the financial sector in expanding further in a
more sound, healthy and efficient manner,” the Report said, and added that effective
regulation is the preferred route for central banks responsible for safeguarding both monetary
and financial stability.

The Report said solvency profile has improved, and given the pressures from the
macroeconomic environment, there is an indication of marginal deterioration in asset quality,
which banks are well-equipped to handle. Stress tests conducted on June-2008 data indicate
that the large banks are relatively robust, with the medium and small-sized banks positioning
themselves in niche markets, it added.

Capital adequacy of the banking system is strong, 12.1 percent at end-June 2008, well
above the internationally acceptable minimum requirement of 8.0 percent, it said and added

PRESIDENT’S VISIT TO THE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

President, Pervez Musharraf visited the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today to seek a
briefing on the State of Pakistan’s Economy from SBP Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar. In
her presentation, the SBP Governor covered the areas of economic growth, inflation,
monetary policy, fiscal and external imbalances, exchange rate and macroeconomic stability.

She underscored that Pakistan like other countries is facing economic stress and challenging
policy scenarios. International financial market turmoil, starting in the US, has now caused a
global economic slowdown, which in turn is adversely impacting the growth prospects of
most Asian and Emerging Market Countries including Pakistan.

She further said that the rising international fuel and commodity prices have considerably
increased the pressures on balance of payments, fiscal accounts and inflation outlook. This is
not only true for Pakistan but also for most of the emerging and developed economies. The
Governor explained that high inflation is economically and socially costly. It adversely
affects investment and growth, creates uncertainty, and erodes peoples’ purchasing power,
particularly of low income group. In this context, Governor highlighted that Pakistan as well
as a number of developing and developed countries are pursuing tight monetary policy to
contain inflation and to mitigate its adverse impacts for long term growth prospects.

Referring to the key policy actions for restoring macroeconomic stability and sustaining
growth, the SBP Governor stressed that the monetary tightening is essential to reduce demand
pressures, which is to be supplemented by fiscal tightening. Besides need for adherence to
fiscal target for FYO9, as enumerated in the budget, in coming years revenue deficit should be
converted into a surplus, as laid down in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act
2005. The Governor added that the key concerns of the SBP are high stress of the
Government borrowings and drain on foreign exchange reserves due to confluence of
domestic and international developments highlighted above.

Dr Akhtar complemented the Government for its decision to reduce the borrowings from SBP
to net zero. She also valued the Government commitment to further work with SBP to reduce
the existing stock of government borrowing from the central bank.

To finance the current account deficit, financing has to be secured through increase in
domestic savings in order to reduce reliance on external financing, the Governor said. She
also pointed out the importance of restoring investors’ confidence with a view to encourage
investment inflows and consistency and continuation of prudent policies.

President Musharraf discussed various issues related to food and oil price developments and
appreciated the SBP’s briefing. He also acknowledged the strengths of SBP as an institution,
its policy advice and its continued support in overall economic development of the country.

The presentation ceremony was attended, among others, by Sindh Governor, Dr Ishratul Ibad
and senior management of the State Bank of Pakistan.

Dr Akhtar urges textile industry to
seek mergers & acquisitions

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has urged upon the textile
industry to seek consolidation of the sector through mergers & acquisitions in order to
effectively face tough international trading environment.

Addressing the members of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) in
Karachi today, she said that the industry should gear itself to deal with increasingly tough
competition in the international market.

“T request you people to seriously look into the consolidation of the sector as
international and regional competitive pressures are going to further build up and it will
be large corporates that are more likely to survive,” Dr Akhtar said and added that the
textile sector should endeavour to achieve economies of scale. “With size comes
everything,” she said and added small-sized enterprises could also benefit by contributing
to large-scale export units.

The Governor also briefed the APTMA members about the rationale behind the
recent increase in the key policy rate. It may be mentioned here that the State Bank
released its Monetary Policy Statement on January 31, 2008 in which the SBP raised its
discount rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%.

Dr Akhtar reiterated that recent monetary tightening by the State Bank was
carried out to contain macro-economic imbalances which are creating inflationary
pressures in the economy.

“Strengthening macroeconomic imbalances is critical for the economy,” she said
and added that the rising fiscal and current account deficits along with excessive
Government borrowing from the State Bank prompted the central bank to raise its key
policy rate.

Government’s reliance on State Bank for budgetary support is also fueling
inflation and the Government has borrowed Rs 334 billion from the central bank up to 7”
February in FY08. Governor said hopefully with the issuance of Global Depository
Receipts and financing through other external resources, the Government will be able to
retire central bank borrowings.

SBP Governor said the tight monetary policy has helped to bring down inflation.
She said headline inflation measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined from
11.1% in April 2005 to 7.4% by May 2007 (even though inflation rate of 7.8% for FY07
was higher than original target of 6.5%). She said that monetary policy has more distinct
impact on reducing core inflation defined to include non-food and non-energy items that
have 51% weightage in the CPI. It is notable that Pakistan was able to bring down the
core inflation to 5.7% by May 2007 from local peak of 8.3% in October 2005. “So,
monetary policy is as relevant in Pakistan as it is in the U.S. or any other developed or
developing economy,” Dr Akhtar emphasized. Inflationary pressures, that have built-up
recently are mostly due to demand side that required an upward adjustment in SBP policy
rate.

external account deficits in the context of changing global
economic environment

 

ISLAMABAD March 11, 2008: Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of
Pakistan has stressed the need for structural reforms to address fiscal and external
account deficits in the context of changing global economic environment. Delivering her
keynote address on ‘Policy Tradeoffs and Structural Issues’ on the occasion of Golden
Jubilee Ceremony of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics at a local hotel
here this afternoon, she also called for increasing national savings to reinvigorate growth
and strengthen economic resilience.

While highlighting key features of strong economic performance of the past few
years, SBP Governor said the strong growth performance of the last five years coupled
with overall sound economic policies gave a lot of confidence to most segments of
society while increasing their incomes. As a consequence people started demanding
more goods and services, both from domestic sources and from abroad, and felt willing to
pay higher prices to enjoy the benefits. “This resulted in, among others, an increase in
imports which along with oil imports has registered an average growth of 24.7% over
FY03-07 outpacing export growth (13.4%) leading to a widening external current account
deficit,” she said and added that until FY07, capital inflows funded fully the external
current account deficit and the residual helped in building foreign exchange reserves
(growing by $5.6 billion over FY03-07). “Even if the oil prices come down and the
growth in foreign inflows restored, the balance of payment position sustainability will
still be under stress as export growth may be impacted by global slowdown,” she said.

Referring to the challenges, she said that the country faces global shocks created
by international financial market turmoil and the unprecedented increase in global
commodity prices, which has generated widespread financial costs and have serious
economic consequences that risks the progress achieved on various fronts.

The Governor also spoke about domestic vulnerabilities triggered by rising twin
deficits as the fiscal and external account imbalances widened. “In the backdrop of
relative slowdown in foreign inflows given Pakistan’s protracted and complicated
political transition, these vulnerabilities have resulted in pressure on exchange
rate/foreign exchange reserves and heavy government borrowings from the SBP,” she
said and added that aside from problems of short-term economic management, this has
created complications for monetary management which had succeeded in bringing the
core inflation down to 5.2% by May 2007-- below the peak levels of 8.3% in October
2005.

She said these international shocks and domestic deficits are interrelated and
entail stringent tradeoffs when it comes to devising and implementing well-coordinated,
timely, and enduring policy responses.

Commenting on the policy responses in the wake of global financial market
turmoil, Dr. Akhtar said that not only is Pakistan facing different sets of complex
challenges, but the emerging global economic scenario itself underscores that Pakistan
does not mimic the policy response of advanced economies. Advanced countries that are
selectively lowering interest rates are those that have enjoyed low inflation for sometime

Dr Akhtar announces waiver of 35%
cash margin on essential imports

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan said Saturday that the
central bank has waived requirement of 35% cash margin on a number of essential import
items with a view to facilitate the trade and industry. She made this announcement at the
third meeting of the Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) held at the State
Bank of Pakistan, Karachi.

 

“With the issuance of this additional list, most of the industrial raw materials and
inputs have now been exempted from the cash margin requirement,” she said and added
that instructions have been issued to all the banks in this regard. She said that this
decision has been taken in order to enable members of FPCCI, APTMA and other trade
bodies to meet their input manufacturing requirements and timely delivery of export
orders. She, however, underscored the need for cooperation from the industry and urged
them not to go for excessive forward import bookings. In addition, she asked the
exporters to bring back their exports proceeds well before the scheduled time.

Dr Akhtar also assured the representatives of the industry that the central bank
will not discontinue export refinance scheme and that the concessional loan facility for
export-oriented industries will continue.

SBP Governor informed the meeting that the private sector credit disbursement
during the current fiscal year (upto May 31, 2008) has remained ‘strong’ despite a
‘challenging economic year’ because of several internal and external shocks that the
economy had faced.

Dr Akhtar informed the participants that overall private sector credit recorded a
higher growth of around 16% in FY08 with Rs 384 billion compared with Rs 287 billion
in FY07. On annualized basis, growth in private sector credit is 19% in FY08, which is
higher than 17% last year, she added. “Distribution of credit has been broad-based as
almost all the sectors of the economy have availed the credit,” she said and added that
major chunk of the credit i.e. 59% was availed by the manufacturing sector including the
textile sector.

She said there has been a massive increase in working capital loans that have risen
to Rs 311 billion in the period from July 2007 to April 2008 in FY08, compared with
Rs 152 billion in the same period of FY07. “Inflationary pressure and higher cost of
inputs are the main reasons for higher credit flow for working capital needs in the current
fiscal year,” she added.

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

 

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has issued the following statement to the media at a
news conference held this evening at SBP Karachi:

‘State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been monitoring closely the recent developments regarding the overall and
bank specific liquidity position. Keeping in view overall liquidity condition of the market, SBP has decided to take
the following actions to ease the immediate liquidity situation and further incentivize banks to rely on medium /
long term balance sheet funding w.e.f. from 18th October 2008.

e Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for all deposits up to one year maturity is being reduced by 200bps to
6.00 percent. As a result of this decrease of 200bps, an additional liquidity of about Rs60 billion will be
released into the system. As communicated earlier there will be another 100bps reduction in CRR which
will bring it down to 5.00 percent w.e.f. 15th November 2008 and will add another Rs 30 billion.

e It has been decided to fully exempt the time deposits of 1 year tenor and above from Statutory Liquidity
Requirements (SLR). This will inject liquidity of about PAR 120 billion in the market.

e The reductions in CRR and exemption of Time Liabilities from SLR will release an aggregate liquidity of
over Rs180 billion immediately into the system and contribute significantly in alleviating the prevalent
liquidity strain in the market. In addition, another PKR 30 billion will be released on 15th November.
Cumulatively SBP between now and 15t* November, 2008 will have released liquidity of Rs 210 billion.

In order to ensure a prudent liquidity profile of the banking system, it has been decided to prescribe a maximum
Advances to Deposit Ratio (ADR) of 70 percent for banks. However, in order to ensure the smooth transition of
banks’ balance sheet to this requirement, a timeline up to March 31, 2009 is being allowed to banks whose
current ADR is above this ratio.

Pakistan’s banking sector is quite resilient and fully capable of withstanding market shocks and adverse macro
economic conditions. The lending and investments of the banks are subject to the stringent prudential
regulations of SBP that prohibit the banks from clean lending above prescribed limit and investment in low
quality assets.

State Bank of Pakistan is continuously monitoring the financial market in Pakistan and will take all necessary
policy measures to ensure the stability of the payment and financial system in the country.

It is reiterated that these are temporary measures aimed at accommodating extraordinary liquidity requirements
of the banking system and, therefore, should not be construed as a change in the monetary policy stance.

It may be recalled that SBP has also recently taken few other measures to improve liquidity position. These measures
included the injection of fresh liquidity into the system through OMOs, reduction in Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR)
by 1 percentage w.e.f. 11"" October, allowing of HTM securities for discounting purposes, and an increase in the SLR
eligibility limit of the PIBs from existing 5 percent to 10 percent of the TDL w.e.f 18"" October, 2008.’

State Bank Launches New-design Rs 50 and new Rs 5 Banknotes

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar launched Rs 50 new-design and new
Rs 5 banknotes at a simple but impressive ceremony held at SBP, Karachi this afternoon. Addressing a
press conference on the occasion, she announced that all the field offices of SBP Banking Services
Corporation will start issuing these banknotes from tomorrow (8"" July, 2008).

Dr Akhtar said that the state-of-the-art security features incorporated in Rs 50 new-design and
new Rs 5 banknotes are of international standards and thus minimize the possibility of their
counterfeiting. Nevertheless, it is important for the public to be well-versed with these security features
so that they can easily recognize a counterfeit banknote when they come across it. Dr Akhtar urged the
media to effectively play their vital and constructive role in educating the public by giving wide coverage
to the security features of Rs 50 new-design and new Rs 5 banknotes.

It may be recalled that the State Bank has already introduced new-design banknotes of Rs 10, 20,
100, 500, 1000 and 5000 denominations. The new-design-upgraded series started gradually by
introduction of Rs 20 banknote from 13"" August 2005, has now been completed with the launch of | Rs
50 new-design and new Rs 5 banknotes from today.

The launch of new high-tech banknotes has helped modernize the banking industry in Pakistan as
the new-design banknotes are equipped with machine readable features. This will facilitate the
automation of handling of banknotes by banks and use of equipment to detect counterfeiting while
processing the banknotes.

Several built-in state-of-the-art security features designed to prevent counterfeit production of
Rs 50 new-design and new Rs 5 banknotes are: anti-copy and anti-scan, micro-lettering, micro text
security thread, and see-through. Besides special feature for visually impaired persons, latent image of
denomination and raised printings are also appearing on new-design banknote of Rs 50 denomination.

The vignette of Gawadar Sea Port is printed on the reverse of the new banknote of Rs 5
denomination and the vignette of Karakoram Peak 8611m is printed on the reverse of new-design
banknote of Rs 50 denomination.

It may be pointed out that Rs 5 demonetized banknote with vignette of Khojak Railway
Tunnel, Balochistan printed on the reverse of this note is no more a legal tender from 1“ July 2005
and should not be used in currency transactions.

The SBP Governor said that the old-design banknotes of Rs 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 & 1000 would
continue to remain in circulation as legal tender along with the new-design banknotes of these
denominations.

It may be mentioned here that the State Bank has started issuing the new orange-green-yellow
colour Rs 20 banknote with effect from 22"" March, 2008. This Rs 20 and the other banknote of the same
denomination in brown colour will continue to remain in circulation as legal tender.

The launching ceremony was attended, among others, by the Acting Chairperson, Pakistan
Security Printing Corporation (PSPC), Ms. Naiyer Muzafar Husain, Deputy Governors, State Bank of
Pakistan, Mr. Mansur-ur-Rehman Khan and Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Managing Director, SBP Banking
Services Corporation, Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Executive Directors, Directors and senior
officials of SBP & PSPC.

Dr Akhtar unveils Monetary Policy
Statement _ for first half of FYO9

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that considering
the risk related to rising external current account and fiscal deficits and worsening inflation
outlook, the central bank has decided to raise its policy rate by 100 basis points to 13 percent
effective July 30, 2008 to contain further aggregate demand pressures which are contributing
to the inflationary pressures.

Fiscal coordination with the monetary policy stance in particular commitment to scale
down Government borrowings from the central bank and to contain import growth is critical to
achieve the desired impact of monetary tightening, she said at a press conference at SBP,
Karachi this afternoon while unveiling the Monetary Policy Statement for the first half of the
current fiscal year 2008-09 (FYO9).

She further informed that considering the adverse impact of continued borrowing by
the Government from SBP on inflation, the SBP Central Board of Directors resolved that the
Government should retire Rs 21 billion in each quarter of FYO9.

Dr Akhtar said in order to restore macroeconomic stability there was a need for
additional corrective policy actions, both at the Government and central bank level. She said
assuming the domestic demand continues to grow at last five-year average of 8.1 percent and
the real GDP growth target of 5.5 percent for FYO9 is achieved, the difference between
domestic demand and supply is expected to widen further.

Therefore, it was of utmost importance to curtail aggregate demand pressures through
restraining expenditures in the short run; increase the production capacity of the economy by
addressing structural constraints; and improving factor productivity, she added.

Dr Akhtar said that these measures are necessary for ensuring price stability and long
term growth on sustainable basis. While it is expected that some of the demand pressures will
recede in the current fiscal year, but if the supply side issues are not addressed, the ‘gap’ could
remain unchanged and the expected favourable impact on inflation will be diluted, she added.

While outlining outlook for the current 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9), Dr Akhtar stressed
that FYO9 ought to be a year of consolidation as the new democratic Government has entered
FYO9 with heavy overhang in the economy of the last year’s macroeconomic imbalances. At the
same time, the Government carries the responsibility of fulfilling the aspirations and promises
to the nation, she added.

“The trade offs are not easy and global economic environment continues to be fraught
with uncertainties though some trends are quite clear: global growth has slowed down,
international liquidity squeeze remains and Pakistan sovereign rating prevents tapping

State Bank Issues Instructions & Guidelines for
Shariah Compliance in IBIs

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued Instructions & Guidelines for Shariah
Compliance in Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) to further strengthen the Shariah
compliance framework in Islamic banking industry.

These ‘Instructions and Guidelines for Shariah Compliance’ have been finalized
in consultation with various stakeholders as well as reviewed and approved by the SBP
Shariah Board.

It may be pointed out that these Instructions and Guidelines for IBIs are in
addition to current Prudential Regulations, guidelines and other directives issued by the
SBP.

The ‘Instructions for Shariah compliance in IBIs’ cover various areas related to
appointment, removal and working of Shariah Advisors (SAs); conflict resolution in
Shariah rulings; Shariah compliant modes; use of charity fund, introduction of new
products and services and schedule of service charges etc. It may be pointed out that
essentials of Islamic modes of financing, issued by SBP in April 2005, have now been
augmented and made part of these instructions.

According to these instructions, every IBI will be required to appoint a Shariah
Advisor in line with a clear set of instructions issued by the SBP including that the
appointment of Shariah Advisor will be approved by the Board of Directors; Shariah
Advisor will be required to meet the ’Fit and Proper Criteria for Shariah Advisors’
notified by the SBP; the Fatawa and rulings of the Shariah Advisor in all financial
matters shall be binding on the IBIs etc.

In terms of duties & responsibilities of the Shariah Advisor (SA), the SA will be
responsible to review operations of the IBI on periodic basis in coordination with
officials responsible for Shariah compliance to ensure that all the products and services
being offered by the IBI conform to the injunctions of Shariah. If any income is declared
as non-Shariah compliant by the SA, the same shall be credited to Charity Account
opened for this purpose. According to the instructions, the SA will also be required to
prepare a report on the IBI’s annual financial statement in respect of its Shariah
compliance.

These instructions also deal with Conflict Resolution in Shariah rulings wherein
in case of any difference of opinion arising between the SA of an IBI and the State
Bank’s inspection staff or other SBP departments regarding Islamic Banking practices,
the State Bank may refer the case to the SBP Shariah Board and the decision of SBP
Shariah Board will be final.

The State Bank has also introduced a complete new set of Shariah-compliant
modes of Banking and Financing for IBIs that include Mudaraba; Musharaka;
Diminishing Musharaka; Equity participation in the form of shares in a corporate entity;
Tjarah or Ijarah wa Iqtina; Murabaha; Musawamah; Salam; Istisna; Tawarrugq; Qard;
Wakalah; Assignment of Debt and Kafalah.

Pakistan’s economy continues to show resilience
to domestic & international shocks: SBP Report

Pakistan’s economy continues to show resilience to domestic and international
shocks. Although these shocks have taken their toll, the economy is expected to turn ina
reasonable growth performance during the current fiscal year (2007-08), albeit
substantially lower than target. This observation was made in the Second Quarterly
Report for FY08 of the State Bank on the State of Pakistan’s Economy which was
released today.

The Report said the State Bank estimates suggest that FY08 real Gross Domestic
Product growth would be in the range of 6.0-6.5 percent. “This below target growth
nonetheless remains strong,” it asserted. It said an unanticipated strength in international
commodity prices is mainly responsible for cost push driven inflationary pressures in the
economy and added these pressures further intensified due to strong aggregate demand
amidst a continuing fiscal stimulus. “As a result, it is likely that FY08 inflation would be
in the range of 8.0-9.0 percent, significantly above the target of 6.5 percent for the year,”
it added.

The Report noted that the growing macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the
widening fiscal and current account deficits continued to create complications and add to
inflationary pressures. On the other hand, Pakistan has so far largely been untouched by
the continuing turmoil in the international credit markets. It said the rise in the fiscal
deficit during first half (July-December) of FY08 has more troubling implications than
the increase in the previous year. The modest increase in the fiscal deficit during the
preceding two years had been relatively less troubling, as (1) revenue growth had
remained strong, and (2) rise in spending essentially reflected the impact of post-
earthquake relief and reconstruction (excluding this, the fiscal deficit remained below 4.0
percent of GDP); these substantive expenditures would fall sharply in a few years, it
added.

Reducing the fiscal deficit in the remaining part of the fiscal year will thus be
challenging, but is nonetheless essential, the Report said and added that support to
aggregate demand due to fiscal deficit contributed directly to a rise in monetary
aggregates, raising inflationary pressures, complicating monetary management, and
stoking the growth of the current account deficit.

The Report said the combination of rising fiscal deficit and weak external receipts
has pushed the government borrowings from SBP to a record Rs 359.3 billion during
July-1* March FY08, compared to only Rs 25.6 billion in the corresponding period of last
fiscal year. “This has been instrumental in sustaining the growth in broad money (M2)
for the period at 17.6 percent YoY, significantly offsetting the central bank’s efforts to
tighten monetary policy,” the Report added.

The Report said the information available by mid-February 2008 suggests that
agriculture sector is likely to record reasonable growth during the fiscal year. Prospects

State Bank committed to protect
interest of banks’ customers

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar has once again reminded
all commercial banks to adopt fair practices and to make complete disclosure of the
lending and deposit rates of all consumer products offered by them and to clarify the
pricing structure of the loan in the their respective loan agreements with their
customers.

It may be pointed out that the existing instructions of the State Bank require
banks to get the schedule of charges printed and make the same available to their
customers at all branches at least seven days before the commencement of the half
year. The banks are also required to make available their schedule of charges on
their websites. Similarly, locker-holder issue has also been taken care of by
prescribing the insurance ceiling as per the size of the locker. Only recently, the SBP
advised all banks to pay a minimum of 5% profit to all depositors regardless of their
account balances.

All these instructions and other measures taken by the State Bank from time
to time are manifestation of SBP’s resolve to protect the interest of banks’
customers. The State Bank has also taken a number of steps to ensure that
consumers have access to accurate information, fair credit billing and reporting, fair
debt collection practices etc. Most of these issues will be further addressed as SBP is
processing “Consumer Protection Act” and issuance of “Fair Debt Collection
Guidelines” in the near future; former would need to be considered by the
Government / legislature.

Complaints by certain quarters that banks charge very high mark-up rates on
credit cards products need to be seen in the proper context. Credit Cards are not a
debt instrument and the banks allow Credit facility free of mark-up/interest to their
Card holders for the period around 30 to 45 days or as specified in their terms and
conditions accepted by card holders. The card holders may make purchases and can
make payments within the stipulated period without any financial charges. One of
the features of Credit Card is withdrawal of cash. Any liberty available to the card
holder to pay the amount in toto without any mark-up or extra charges is not meant
for cash withdrawals. Further, the high mark-up rate on credit cards can be
attributed to high cost associated with their marketing, recovery, administration and
fund utilization. The same scenario exists internationally.

In addition to establishment of the Office of the Banking Mohtasib, the SBP
has established a full-fledged Consumer Protection Department to effectively resolve
consumer’s complaints against banks. The State Bank has already addressed the
issue of early disposal of the complaints by directing the banks/DFls to provide
redressal within a period of 10 working days. However, in any case, the final reply
may be sent within a period not exceeding 45 working days, barring cases where
reasonable grounds exist on record for not complying within the prescribed time
period.

Monetary tightening to contain
macro economic imbalances: Dr Akhtar

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan said today that
recent monetary tightening by the State Bank was carried out to contain macro
economic imbalances which are creating inflationary pressures in the economy.

She was addressing businessmen and industrialists on State Bank’s
Monetary Policy at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FPCCI) in Karachi. The meeting was a part of SBP’s efforts to apprise
the business community of different aspects of the Monetary Policy.

It may be mentioned here that the State Bank released its Monetary Policy
Statement on January 31, 2008 in which the SBP raised its discount rate by 50
basis points to 10.5%.

“Monetary tightening is a prerequisite to contain macro economic
imbalances,” Dr Akhtar said and added that the State Bank does not want to stifle
growth. “We want to ensure adequate macro economic stability which is a
prerequisite to attract investment,” she emphasized. Dr Akhtar explained that
rising fiscal and current account deficits along with excessive Government
borrowing from the State Bank prompted the central bank to raise its key policy
rate.

Dr Akhtar asserted that Monetary Policy is very much relevant in the
context of Pakistani economy, as it has helped to contain ‘inflation levels’ in the
country. She said that with the help of tight monetary policy adopted since April 2005,
Pakistan managed to reduce inflation rate quite significantly over 2006 and up to May
2007. Headline inflation measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined from 11.1%
in April 2005 to 7.4% by May 2007 (even though inflation rate of 7.8% for FY07 was
higher than original target of 6.5%). She said that monetary policy has more distinct
impact on reducing core inflation defined to include non-food and non-energy items that
have 51% weight in the CPI. It is notable that Pakistan was able to bring down the core
inflation to 5.2% by May 2007 from local peak of 8.3% in October 2005. “If we had
not tightened the monetary policy, inflation would have been in double digit or
significantly higher than 10%,” she added.

She said that while the demand side factors are playing the major role in
aggravating macroeconomic imbalances and overall inflation, one of the reasons
behind rising food inflation is supply-side constraints and added that these
constraints are generated because of the behavior of industry, wholesalers and
retailers that are creating artificial shortages.

Dr Akhtar said Government’s reliance on State Bank for budgetary support
is also fueling inflation and added that the Government has borrowed Rs 334
billion from the central bank upto 7 February in FY08. She said although the
Government has assured the State Bank that it will retire this borrowing, further

Recent Slide in the Rupee’s External Value

Governor SBP has indicated that SBP is continuing to support the rupee to ensure
exchange rate stability. | As astep in this direction, SBP had tightened monetary policy
on 22 May 2008 and this was packaged with the imposition of 35% L/C margin on nonoil
and nonfood imports. These measures helped infuse a degree of exchange rate
stability. In the last few weeks of FY08 exchange rate stabilized to an average of
Rs.67.50.

Industry however appealed for withdrawal of the L/C margins to allow for import of raw
material and intermediate goods for a number of industries. SBP had requested the
Industry and Commerce Chambers that the withdrawal of L/Cs was_ being
accommodated on the basis of understanding that industry would import the most vital
and essential imports for their industry and will refrain from forward booking of
imports. However, in the last few days the level of forward booking for imports has
been high while the export proceeds have been delayed. The posture of market
participants is causing complications in the smooth functioning of foreign exchange
market. In general, the import demand and other requirements have resulted in
significant outflow of foreign exchange from the market, while inflows & supply of foreign
exchange remained low.

Exchange rate is mainly determined by market forces of demand & supply without any
specific target level of the exchange rate; however, SBP does and has intervened in the
foreign exchange market to reduce excess volatility, prevent the emergence of
destabilizing speculative activities and develop an orderly foreign exchange market.

Demand for the dollar has increased mainly due to the tremendous increase in imports.
January-May 2008 saw imports increase by 51% over the corresponding period last year.
On the supply side of foreign exchange market, Pakistan received less inflows than
expected. Between January and May 2008, exports rose by only 22% while foreign
direct investment and portfolio investment also fell compared to the same period in 2007.

In May 08, speculative activities came to a head, leading to a quick decline in the value
of the rupee. The SBP took a number of interim monetary policy measures in response,
including the imposition of higher interest rates, stricter LC margins, increased reserve
requirements, and enhanced regulation of foreign exchange companies, which stabilized
the exchange rate to an extent, with the rupee witnessing some appreciation.

However, on account of the 1) continued political uncertainty, 2) shortfall in the foreign
exchange receipts in the last quarter of FY08 and the 3) exemption of several items from
L/C cash margin requirement; pressure on the exchange rate has re-emerged in the first
week of July. In the first eight days of the current fiscal year PKR has depreciated by
6.6%. Consequently, in order to arrest this recent fall in the value of the rupee, which is
largely a reflection of market sentiments, SBP has taken the following measures with
immediate impact: 1) Forward booking against all types of imports have been suspended
temporarily 2) Advance payments against import Letter of credit has been reduced from

State Bank develops Financing Scheme
for Small Farmers

The State Bank of Pakistan has developed a Financing Scheme on group-based
methodology for small farmers involved in crop and non-crop activities in order to
improve the access to finance to such farmers who are unable to meet adequate collaterals
requirements of commercial banks.

Under the scheme, banks shall provide loans to the members of small farmers’
group for crop and non-crop activities, based on their cash flow under joint cross
guarantee of group members. The scheme covers all areas of the group-based financing
methodology including group formation, roles & responsibilities of members, bank &
group coordinator, size and tenure of loans, documentation and other related matters.
However, financing to small farmers under the scheme shall be subject to compliance
with SBP regulations on agriculture financing.

It may be pointed out that under group-based lending programs; loans are given to
individuals through a peer group. In this case, group members guarantee repayment, of
each other’s loans and collateral is generally not used but peer pressure and collective
responsibilities generated by the group take their place.

Financing under the scheme will not exceed Rs200,000/- per borrower, which is
within the clean lending limits of Prudential Regulations for Agriculture Financing.
However, the exact amount of loan will be determined by the bank based on genuine
requirements and cash flow of the applicant. Maximum period of loan should be fixed as
per Prudential Regulations, repayment schedule may be set as per production cycle of the
crop/non-crop activities being financed or revolving credit facility for three years subject
to mandatory clean up of entire liabilities (both principal and mark up) once in a year or
cash flow of the borrower in case of non-crop activities. Banks are advised that they
should have detailed understanding and information about the borrower’s business and
his/her assets as well as his/her capacity to effectively use and repay the loan.

Moreover, under the scheme the loan can be extended for working capital
requirement of the farming community both for crop as well as non- crop activities.
Banks can also provide term loan facility to small farmers for making different types of
improvements in the land, construction of sheds/ ponds, development of orchards/
nurseries, purchase of livestock, farm implements, machinery, tube wells, generators etc.

Prime Minister Inaugurates

 

Real Time Gross Settlement System at SBP

 

Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani today inaugurated the Real Time Gross
Settlement System (RTGS) that would enable banks to settle their large value payments in real
time using a computerized network.

The inauguration ceremony which was held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi was
attended, among others, by Sindh Governor, Dr Ishratul Ibad, Sindh Chief Minister, Syed Qaim

Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis, Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah, Special Assistant to Prime
Minister on Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs, Ms. Hina Rabbani Khar and Special
Assistant to Prime Minister, Ms. Shahnaz Wazir Ali.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan,
informed the Prime Minister about the functionalities being offered by the new system and its
positive impact on the banking industry. She mentioned that the RTGS will facilitate the instant
transfer of high value funds via electronic means and pointed out that the RTGS project is a
complex undertaking and a lot of work has been done to make its implementation a reality. By
launching the RTGS system, Pakistan became one of those countries who had such advanced
payment systems, she added.

Dr Akhtar said that Centralized Multilateral Net Settlement in RTGS will enable banks to
efficiently use their liquidity, which previously they had to maintain in different current
accounts with the SBP BSC offices for retail clearing. She said the corporate customers of the
banks will also be able to use RTGS for their time-critical payments and added that RTGS
Implementation provides the capability of connecting with various other regional /
international payment systems for foreign exchange, government bonds, and private equity
settlements.

SBP officials demonstrated and explained the process of funds transfer via RTGS to the
Prime Minister, who completed one such transaction to inaugurate the system. Initially 39
commercial banks and Development Finance Institutions (DFls) would be the direct members of
the system.

Mr. Gilani also visited the State Bank Treasury where he was briefed by the Governor
and the Executive Director, Mr. Asad Qureshi about the treasury operations of the Bank.

The Prime Minister also inaugurated an exhibition titled ‘Celebrating the Past’ at the SBP
premises, which was held to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Bank. The Prime
Minister took keen interest in different vintage coins, historical artifacts and documents
displayed at the exhibition.

Banks, Insurance Firms to Launch
Crop Loan Insurance Scheme from Rabi Season

A meeting of the State Bank of Pakistan’s Task Force on Crop Loan Insurance
Framework today agreed to launch crop loan insurance scheme for farmers throughout the
country from coming Rabi crop season.

The Task Force meeting, chaired by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of
Pakistan, held at SBP, Karachi was apprised that the insurance companies and banks have
shown their willingness to start the scheme.

The Task Force constituted by the Governor SBP last year under the Chairmanship of,
President Habib Bank Ltd., was assigned to develop a commercially viable and sustainable
Crop Loan Insurance Scheme with the help of all stakeholders to mitigate the risk of losses
occurring to agricultural borrowers due to natural calamities and risks of defaults to banks by
such borrowers.

Dr Akhtar said that since major commercial banks and insurance companies have
developed their crop insurance programs/products based on the framework developed by
SBP Task Force and some of these have already come to the market, therefore, the objective
of the Task Force to develop a commercially viable and sustainable Crop Loan Insurance
Scheme (CLIS) that can be adopted by the market players has been accomplished.

“It is hoped that the scheme will not only facilitate the banks in expanding their
outreach of agricultural credit but will also reduce burden on the national exchequer,” Dr
Akhtar added.

During the meeting, the Chairman of Task Force, President HBL Mr. Zakir Mahmood,
explained that development of a market-based system was a challenge particularly in the
backdrop of many unsuccessful moves made in the past two decades. Therefore, the Task
Force adopted a strategy to review the lessons of international best practices, he said and
added many data series were compiled by SBP on calamities announcements, crop wise, &
district wise loan disbursements, size of production loans, data on write-offs & NPLs and
other seasonal analysis. The insurance companies also shared the database with the
reinsurers abroad and after detailed deliberations a workable, viable and market-based
framework has been formulated.

He pointed out that the proposed framework is based on common denominators
acceptable to leading insurance companies and banks. The scheme would provide cover to
the borrowers against their losses due to natural calamities up to the amount of outstanding
loan and mark up thereon. The insurance companies will charge a maximum of 2% premium
for all major field crops and the risk is covered against excessive rains, hail, frost, flood,
drought, and crop related diseases like viral and bacterial attacks or damage by locusts. The
scheme will be mandatory for the borrowers of the banks.

The representatives of the insurance companies said that after successful
implementation, the insurance cover will also be extended to the non-borrowing farmers.
Governor SBP, while thanking the private insurance companies, appreciated the role of the

State Bank urges banks to utilize
SBP financial inclusion initiatives

Mr Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today stressed upon all
commercial banks, microfinance banks and microfinance institutions to utilize State Bank’s
initiatives regarding agricultural, microfinance and SME financing to create an enabling
environment for financial inclusion of the rural population.

Speaking at Asia Pacific Rural And Agricultural Credit Association’s (APRACA) FinPower
Program on Rural Finance held at State Bank of Pakistan in Karachi, Mr Anwar said that banks
should undertake their best efforts to meet the maximum credit needs of the rural community.

“Innovations in product development and adoption of best practices are the need of the
hour that would assist in developing the rural economy, eradicating poverty and increasing
food security,” he added.

APRACA is a regional forum for sharing knowledge of international best practices of the
region in agri/rural finance. State Bank is a member of APRACA.

Highlighting State Bank’s initiatives to promote rural finance in the country, Mr Anwar
said that the State Bank has formulated a separate Development Finance Group to synergize all
rural finance activities vis. agriculture, SME and microfinance. In addition to this group, other
arms of SBP are contributing in aligning its policies to the initiatives and developments for
encouraging the banks to adopt development finance as a viable business, he added.

He said Agriculture lending has received a significant boost as the banks have met their
targets over the past 5 to 6 years and the agri. disbursement has increased to Rs 212 billion in
FY 2007-08 from Rs 39 billion in FY 1999-2000.

Under the new paradigm, SBP has taken several initiatives in the last 7 years which, inter
alia, include the induction of 14 domestic private banks in agricultural credit scheme, besides
the five big banks and two specialized banks viz. ZTBL & PPCBL, standardization of loan
documents and issuance of guidelines for livestock, fisheries, poultry & horticulture financing.
Further, to resolve the issue of the farmers for fresh documentation for input loans on each
crop loans, a Revolving Credit Scheme for three year credit limits with one time documentation
was introduced. To implement SBP’s initiatives at the regional level, separate Development
Finance Support Department and its units have been established at SBP-BSC.

He said to mitigate the risk of banks and the farming community against losses caused
by natural calamities, the SBP has developed a Crop Loan Insurance Framework with the help of
a Task Force comprising of representatives of banks, leading insurance companies, the farming
community and other stakeholders. Based on SBP’s framework, a mandatory crop loan
insurance scheme has been introduced from Rabi crop 2008-09 for major crops, viz. wheat,
cotton, rice, sugarcane and maize, he added.

“SBP is striving to establish a farmer-friendly market based financial sector in the
country to meet the increasing credit requirements of the agriculture sector,” he added.

Referring to microfinance sector, he said that the State Bank has developed a national
strategy to target 3 million microfinance clients by 2010 and 10 million by 2015. Currently,
MEBs and MFIs have an outreach of 1.8 million borrowers. SBP has identified three concurrent

Prime Minister Gilani vows to
restore macroeconomic stability

Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani today reiterated the Government’s
resolve to restore macroeconomic stability through proper coordination between the
monetary and fiscal authorities.

Inaugurating the one-day Development Finance Conference, organized by the
State Bank of Pakistan on the eve of its 60'"" Anniversary, at Learning Resource Centre,
SBP Karachi, Mr. Gilani said that the recently concluded 2007-08 fiscal year was ‘a
challenging economic year.’ He said that the country currently faces four major
economic challenges including a deceleration in economic growth, rising inflation,
instability in exchange rate and high fiscal and external account deficits, and added that
the Government is committed to address these challenges.

“High growth in macroeconomic imbalances testifies that the country was living
beyond its financial affordability,” Mr. Gilani said. “These challenges are daunting but
our resolve is equally stronger,” he said and added that he is confident that through
better coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities, the Government will
succeed in restoring financial stability in a reasonable time frame.

Mr. Gilani said that the Government aims to bring down fiscal deficit to 4.7% of
Gross Domestic Product in the current 2008-09 (FYO9) fiscal year from around 7.0% in
the last fiscal year. “The Government is aiming to contain fiscal deficit in the range of
3.0% to 3.5% of GDP in the medium term,” he said and added the Government also
intends to keep economic growth in the 6% to 7% range in the next five years.

“Our focus will be on quality of growth in agriculture, manufacturing and the
services sector,” he said and added that tackling energy crisis and overhauling of tax
policy and tax administration will be Government’s key policy objectives. He also said
that the Government will take all necessary measures to promote private sector
development, because the Government genuinely believes that the private sector is the
real engine of growth, and the main source of employment generation.

“The Government should not be in the business of running businesses,” he said
and added that the Government’s role should be to facilitate and create conducive
environment, where the private sector can play its role effectively “Private sector led
initiatives, together with an aggressive export drive will set the country, on a higher and
sustainable growth path,” Mr. Gilani added.

Talking about recently announced Federal Budget, the Prime Minister said that
his Government has scaled down and reoriented subsidies. Scaling down subsidies was
required to remain within the budget deficit of 4.7% and the reorientation is primarily to
provide a targeted subsidy that aims to provide relief to the poor, notwithstanding, over
40% of Government's fiscal deficit is on account of the subsidy bill, he added.

Good Corporate Governance vital to financial
system stability: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said good corporate
governance for the banking industry, with assets to GDP ratio of almost 59%, is critical
in ensuring solvency and stability of the country’s financial system and to provide
impetus to economic growth.

Delivering her keynote address on ‘Corporate Governance for Banks’ at a
convocation of the Institute of Bankers, Pakistan today at a local hotel in Lahore, she said
that the State Bank has been on the forefront in promoting good corporate governance in
the country as a regulator and supervisor of banks and DFIs.

“SBP has implemented a comprehensive corporate governance regime for banks,
which is driven by a robust legal and regulatory framework, risk-based supervision and
over-arching banking sector reforms, notably, privatization, liberalization and
consolidation of banks,” she said and added the major thrust of legal and regulatory
requirements is to strengthen the functioning of the Boards of Directors of banks.

Dr Akhtar said recently the State Bank has separated the positions of chairman
and CEO of banks and made it mandatory on banks to appoint on the Board at least 25%
independent directors and not more than two executive directors. SBP has also
strengthened the fit and proper criteria and approves appointment of directors and CEO
of banks in line with the criteria. Banks must also follow the fit and proper criteria in
appointing key executives although such appointments do not require SBP approval, she
added.

She said SBP has also issued guidelines on risk management, internal controls, IT
security and business continuity planning besides detailed instructions on policy
framework for banks, risk management framework including regulatory requirements that
check banks’ exposure to group companies and other related parties, restrict exposure to
single borrower, borrowing group or sector, as well as limit banks’ investments in equity
market.

While giving details about current regulatory requirements for banks, SBP
Governor said that the State Bank like other central banks is also steering the
implementation of Basel-II in a phased manner. Initially banks are required to adopt the
Standardized Approach for credit risk and the Basic Indicator/ Standardized Approach for
operational risk from 1st January 2008, she said and added, subsequently, once banks
improve their in house systems, they would have the option to switch over to more
advanced approaches from 1st January 2010 subject to the adequacy of capacities and
capabilities and its due diligence by SBP.

Dr Akhtar said as a further step to strengthen governance of banks, they are
required to undergo credit rating annually. The rating must be announced publicly and
disclosed in the financial statements of the bank, she said and added SBP also requires
banks to appoint auditors from a panel of pre-approved auditors maintained by it. “The
objective is to ensure credibility of audited financial statements of banks,” she added.

STATE BANK REMAINS COMMITTED TO BRING
DOWN INFLATION: DR AKHTAR

The State Bank of Pakistan issued its Monetary Policy Statement for the second half of
FY08, which was approved by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting held
in Karachi today, with Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar in the Chair.

The State Bank Governor briefed the newsmen about the salient features of the Monetary
Policy at a press conference held after the Board meeting.

Dr. Akhtar said that the monetary stance adopted since April, 2005 has had a visible
impact. Core inflation came down during FY06 and FY07, albeit slowly and with the
standard lag typically observed in developing countries. The Governor explained that the
progress achieved in reducing core inflation has to be judged in context of the (i)
significant and lingering monetary overhang brought about by earlier easing; (ii)
excessive growth in reserve money in FY07 due to exceptional requirements of the textile
industry for re-financing and budget’s continued recourse during the fiscal year on central
bank borrowings; and (iii) supply management problems affecting key food items and the
significant rise in global commodity prices that has been generating new inflationary
pressures in most economies. Due to the sizeable impact of the latter two items in
particular, there has been a reversal, since May 2007, in core inflation. Trend headline
inflation (Consumer Price Index) has stayed around the same level of the last two years,
but this is much higher than the target of 6.5 percent.

The Governor elaborated that the developments in the first half of FY08 substantially
deviated from the monetary policy framework. Most significant among these deviations
is the behavior of the fiscal account. Slippages from the fiscal deficit target have, and
will, cause complications for monetary management during the course of the year. During
the course of the year, liquidity management was challenging as the commercial banks
and central bank ended up together financing almost 60 percent of the budget deficit for
the July 1 - January 29, FY08 period.

Notwithstanding the impact of the political uncertainty and pressures of government
borrowings on the financial system, private sector credit managed to grow by 10.4
percent during July | -January 19, FY08 compared to 10.2 percent over corresponding
period of the previous year. This was partly helped by the calibrated liquidity injections
in the system and a decline in the effective Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). Banks and
SBP worked closely to ensure export financing was being provided in line with
requirements. As of January 5, 2008 exporters benefited from Rs139.6 billion export
credit against Rs131.6 billion at the same point in time in FY07.

Dr. Akhtar stressed that the tight monetary policy stance, especially since the previous
policy rate increase, has begun to lose some of its steam. A moderate increase in KIBOR

SBP, Government working closely to restore
macroeconomic stability: Dr Akhtar

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that the Federal
Government and the central bank are working in tandem to restore macroeconomic
stability.

In a press statement today she said that the Government and the central bank
are taking several measures to improve the macroeconomic situation which has been
adversely affected as a consequence of various global events such as seizing up of
financial markets in the U.S. and Europe or escalating commodity and fuel prices in the
international markets.

“The timing of these global developments could not have been worse. Not only
was our economy’s business cycle maturing after a strong and resilient performance but
the socio-political set-up was also undergoing a transitional phase,” she said and added
that a combination of these elements would put the resolve of any government to test
and Pakistan is no exception.

Dr Akhtar said that there has been a 350 basis point cumulative increase in
interest rates since July 2007 which has been accompanied by appropriate market-led
exchange rate adjustment in the wake of the balance of payments challenges. The
Government has further assured of its resolve to curtail fiscal deficit -- a critical element
of the macroeconomic stabilization program -- and to strive to ensure net zero central
bank borrowings for each quarter with a view to achieve these objectives, fiscal
tightening is being pursued through a combination of measures ranging from recurrent
expenditure controls, removal of subsidies and rationalization and prioritization of
development expenditures. She said and added that the early indications are that
revenue growth is above expectations for the current fiscal year.

Referring to financing plan for meeting the budget and external sector
requirements of the Federal Government, Dr Akhtar said that the Government plans to
selectively privatize some assets and has been in dialogue with International Financial
Institutions to meet the financing gap. “Advanced is the discussion with Asian
Development Bank which has negotiated a $500 million program for accelerated
economic transformation that focuses on supporting financial sector reforms among
others,” she said and added that in parallel, the World Bank has reassured its support
for fast tracking investment programming of close to $1 billion which is focused on high
priority development projects.

SBP extends help to mitigate financial
difficulties of Balochistan Government

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has expressed her resolve to
mitigate the financial difficulties of the Balochistan Government by offering a financial relief
package.

The financial relief package, which will be subject to approval by the Central Board of
Directors of the State Bank, was offered by Dr Akhtar during a recent meeting with Nawab
Muhammad Aslam Raisani, Chief Minister of Balochistan.

The package aims to provide a breathing space to Balochistan Government by putting
its overdraft with the SBP into a blocked account which would be brought to zero within a
period of six years by deductions of suitable monthly installments. In order to further facilitate
the Balochistan Government, the existing limit of Ways and Means Advance would be
enhanced to Rs 2 billion from Rs 1.7 billion.

Dr Akhtar has, however, emphasized that the Balochistan Government can truly reap
the benefits of facilitation package if it imposes strict financial discipline and manages its cash
inflows from other resources such as royalties etc.

It may be mentioned here that the financial position of the Balochistan Government
began to deteriorate since November, 2003. During 2004, in order to provide relief to
Balochistan Government, SBP sanctioned various concessions for Balochistan Government but
Balochistan Government’s measures to reduce its outstanding liabilities fell short of
expectations.

During a meeting of SBP Governor with the Chief Minister of Balochistan in April 2008,
the Balochistan Government was asked to provide the revised estimates of financial
projections, additional amount expected from the Federal Government and additional cash
inflows from other sources such as royalty etc.

The Balochistan Government during the meeting of SBP Governor and the CM
Balochistan on September 1, 2008 presented its plan to overcome its financial crisis and to
reduce the overdraft. Based on the financial projections presented by the Balochistan
Government and its commitment to reduce the overdraft with SBP, Dr Akhtar agreed to offer a
one-time financial relief package as an exception to the Balochistan Government subject to the
approval of the Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan.

Dr Akhtar urges IBIs to enhance
outreach to rural areas

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State bank of Pakistan has urged upon the
Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) to increase their penetration in rural areas of
the country and diversify their network for the benefit of underserved segment of
the society.

Speaking at a ceremony held in Karachi this afternoon to celebrate the
establishment of 100"" branch of Meezan Bank, Dr Akhtar said that she counts on
Islamic banks to enhance their outreach by opening up branches in rural areas and
focus on farm and non-farm based lending. She also spoke about State Bank’s
New Branch Licensing Policy and said that the State Bank has allowed substantial
growth in branch network.

She said the new licensing policy is ‘very liberal’ under which each bank is
required to set up at least 20% of the total branches, under their annual branch
expansion plans, in rural areas for the purpose of enhancing the outreach of
banking services. SBP Governor said under the policy, the State Bank has allowed
microfinance banks to open as many branches as they want in the rural areas.

“Along the same lines, I think Islamic banks may also be allowed to set up
as many branches in rural areas as they want,” the Governor remarked. Dr Akhtar
said that there is also a unique opportunity for Islamic banks to do infrastructure
financing and long-term lending. She also said that rural areas of Pakistan have
great potential of growth and Islamic banking could play a pivotal role in the
development of these areas.

“Rural prosperity has increased over the years and capacity to buy and save
is higher in rural areas,” Dr Akhtar said. She congratulated the management of
Meezan Bank in achieving yet another milestone on top of an impressive growth
over the last five years.

Earlier, Mr Irfan Siddiqui, President and CEO of Meezan Bank in his
welcome address said that Meezan Bank is now operating in 31 cities of the
country and branch expansion will continue during 2008 with an aim to increase
network to150 branches. He said the Bank’s total deposit base is over Rs 52
billion, 42% of total Islamic banking industry, and its financing stands at Rs 30
billion which is 34% of total Islamic banking financing while its total assets are

worth Rs 64 billion or 36% of overall Islamic banking assets in Pakistan.

State Bank takes several measures for
secured plastic money transactions

The State Bank of Pakistan has taken several measures to enhance security of plastic money
transactions in the country with a view to effectively address customer complaints and to ensure
continued growth in the fields of e-banking and e-commerce.

It may be pointed out that the misuse of debit/credit cards has opened new chapters of fraud
and forgery. In most of these cases, the misuse of cardholders’ personal information has occupied a
prominent place. Previously, Point of Sale (POS) terminals used to generate transaction slips visibly
indicating the cardholder personal information such as name of the cardholder, 16-digit Card Number,
date of expiry, etc., which can easily be used for fraudulent purposes. In order to effectively address this
issue, the Payment Systems Department of the State Bank of Pakistan in collaboration with commercial
banks initiated Primary Account Number (PAN) masking project. Under the project, all the POS terminals
have been reconfigured so that they should print only the encrypted transaction slips.

This exercise has been successfully completed and more than 54000 POS terminals placed at
various merchant locations (such as petrol pumps, shopping centres etc) across the country were
reconfigured for PAN masking. This security feature would definitely enhance the confidence of
consumers in Pakistan which eventually help in promoting e-Banking culture in the country. Plastic
money users now comfortably can use their Debit/Credit/Smart cards anywhere in Pakistan irrespective
of the amount of transaction without fear of disclosing their personal information on transaction slips.

This project was undertaken against the backdrop of rapid development in information and
telecommunication technologies coupled with low-cost technology delivery that is enabling new
payment systems models which were not possible a decade ago. The financial institutions around the
world are rapidly introducing new and innovative e-Banking products and services for their customers.
Commercial Banks in Pakistan have also developed various e-Banking products to provide an efficient
and effective payment facility to their customers. The State Bank plays a crucial role in proactively
promoting a safe and secure e-Banking culture in the country.

It may be mentioned here that e-Banking in Pakistan has recorded phenomenal growth over the
years. According to the latest data available, there were 6.4 million cards in circulation of which 24% are
credit cards while the rest or 76% are debit cards. Similarly, more than 3200 ATMs and 54000 Point of
Sale (POS) terminals have been working seamlessly across Pakistan, thus providing 24/7/365 banking
facility to plastic money holders in Pakistan. Such a huge infrastructure supporting card based
transactions indicates huge potential for the growth in e-Banking business in Pakistan.

Pakistan’s banking system stands on sound footings

The State Bank of Pakistan has said that Pakistan’s banking sector is stable, safe and sound and
there should not be any cause of concern about the stability of the banking system.

A State Bank spokesman today said that all banks, including Bank Alfalah and Standard
Chartered Bank, operating in the country are performing well and enjoying good reputation
amongst the general public.

He said that the State Bank of Pakistan has taken serious notice of rumours against a number of
banks, particularly against Bank Alfalah. Such baseless rumours by unscrupulous elements are
an attempt to hurt the credibility of an otherwise sound and well performing bank. He asked the
public not to pay any heed to rumour mongering being done by some unscrupulous elements for
achieving their ulterior motives.

Bank Alfalah is the sixth largest bank in Pakistan and has a healthy balance sheet footing of Rs
331 billion. Operating with a share capital of around Rs 8 billion, as against the minimum
requirement of Rs 4 billion, it has total equity of around Rs 17 billion. The Bank is well
capitalized and its key performance indicators including the solvency ratio reflect robust
performance and sound financial condition. Likewise the Standard Chartered Bank is also a
healthy institution, the spokesman added.

The spokesman pointed out that State Bank has put in place an effective regulatory framework
for banks which has resulted in increased resilience of the banking system.

SBP PROPOSES AMENDMENTS IN BANKING COMPANIES ORDINANCE
TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL RISKS: DR AKHTAR

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, has indicated that SBP is
positioning itself for moving to consolidated supervision, in anticipation of amendments in
the Banking Companies Ordinance (BCO), 1962 to empower SBP to launch this initiative.
She said that this is a timely move in the wake of potential risks arising from complex
structures of financial groups and emergent supervisory challenges. Dr Akhtar disclosed that
the SBP has proposed significant amendments in the Banking Companies Ordinance.

The objective of these proposed amendments is to strengthen the oversight of
financial sector in accordance with the “Ten Year Strategy and Blueprint of Financial Sector
Reforms” of the State Bank of Pakistan, she said while delivering her key-note address on
‘Pakistan: Framework for Consolidated Supervision’ at the 58"" Annual General Meeting of
the Institute of Bankers Pakistan (IBP) in Karachi today.

‘Although Pakistan’s financial sector as a whole has a lot to gain through increased
integration and conglomeration, the newly emerging phenomenon has to be properly
monitored and governed under proper legal framework to mitigate the potential risks,’ Dr
Akhtar added.

The SBP, as a part of its overall financial sector reforms launched in July 2008, has
been advocating the need for legislature to empower the central bank to augment its oversight
of the financial sector, she said and added the legislative reforms launched by SBP in this
area have recently been approved, in principle, by the Cabinet and will to be tabled for
consideration of the Parliament.

SBP Governor said the banking sector being at the core of all activities of the
financial sector, its safety and soundness is critical for public, financial sector itself and the
economy as a whole. ‘However the current legislation and regulatory tools are not adequate
to effectively address the threats to safety and soundness of the financial sector,’ she
observed.

Dr Akhtar said that the amendments proposed by SBP would result into significant
benefits in the form of operational efficiency, lower costs, reduced prices and innovation in
products and services. She said that one of the Core Principles for effective banking
supervision (CP-24) issued by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision requires that a
banking supervisor should be able to supervise the banking groups on a consolidated basis.
Presently, Pakistan is either compliant or largely compliant with all the core principles except
those dealing with consolidated supervision, she said and added: ‘The proposed amendments
would enable Pakistan to ensure compliance with this principle.’

Elaborating further on the amendments in BCO, she said that the major changes were
being proposed in the Banking Companies Ordinance to bring all deposit taking Non Bank
Financial Companies (NBFCs) like Investment Banks, Leasing Companies and Housing
Finance Companies completely under the fold of SBP. The major rationale behind this move
is that these NBFCs are engaged in activities which are quite incidental to banking both on

SBP GOVERNOR DR. SHAMSHAD AKHTAR’S PRESS STATEMENT

 

The following is the text of the statement of the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr.
Shamshad Akhtar, issued to the press tonight:

“SBP has been monitoring closely the recent developments regarding the overall and bank specific
liquidity position. After a measured assessment, SBP has decided to take the following action to
ease the liquidity situation of the market:

e Reduction in the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for all deposits up to one year maturity by
100bps to 8.00 percent w.e.f. from 11% October 2008 and by another 100bps to 7.00
percent w.e.f. 15t? November 2008. As a result of this cumulative decrease of 200bps, Rs61
billion will be released into the system. The liquidity situation will be monitored on a
continuous basis and the change in the CRR may be reviewed accordingly.

It must be remembered that this is a temporary measure aimed at accommodating extraordinary
liquidity requirements of the banking system and, therefore, should not be construed as a change in
the monetary policy stance. Active and calibrated liquidity management is a part of a prudent
monetary policy management necessary to achieve financial as well as overall macroeconomic
stability. The SBP’s assessment of risks to inflation outweighing the risks to growth still holds and
therefore it remains committed to check the snowball impact on inflation expectations of persistently
high fiscal and external current account deficit and overall aggregate demand pressures in order to
achieve price stability over the medium term.

As a result of global financial crises central banks across the globe have now further stepped up
their interventions in the financial markets to shore up confidence and to ease the liquidity situation.
However the domestic macroeconomic situation differs across countries and_ regions.
Macroeconomic stability in Pakistan continues to be under stress on account of both domestic and
external vulnerabilities. The fiscal stress continues to be high. After registering an all time record
borrowings of Rs689 billion from the SBP in FYO8, the Government borrowings have continued to
rise unabated in FYO9 also. This excessive recourse on the banking system borrowings is straining
the credit availability for the private sector and is also causing complications for effective liquidity
management. The weaknesses in the external sector, in particular, constitute a major source of
concern at the moment. Despite strong inflow of workers’ remittances and a decent export
performance the external current account deficit remained at an unsustainable level of 8.4 percent
of GDP in FYO8. With considerable slowdown in private as well as public financial inflows, the
financing gap has widened and consequent outflow of foreign exchange has drained the rupee
liquidity from the system straining the domestic money market; the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the
banking system have depleted by Rs166.5 billion during 1st July- 20"" September FYO9.

Up to $3.5Billion FX inflows to stabilize
Foreign Exchange Markets: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan said today that foreign
exchange inflows to the tune of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion are expected to come in the
banking system in the short to medium-term. These flows coupled with joint efforts of
SBP — Commercial Banks will further stabilize the Pakistani Rupee parity vis-a-vis
U.S. Dollar and calm down foreign exchange markets.

During a meeting with heads of commercial banks at the State Bank of Pakistan
in Karachi, Dr Akhtar assured the participants that there will be ‘no reversal’ of foreign
exchange liberalization measures seen in the past years. However, she expressed her
concerns over excessive volatility and weakened Exchange Rate and commented that
the recent behavior of the exchange market “is totally out of line.”

“We aren’t in a crisis like situation ... several measures are in place to remove
macro-economic imbalances,” she said and added that the Government has expressed
its firm resolve to bring down fiscal-deficit, retire central bank borrowings and cut
non-developmental expenditures. “There is a strong recognition that macro-economic
imbalances have to be resurrected and this is the corner stone of Government’s
economic policy,” she added.

Dr Akhtar informed the meeting that the Government has taken steps to
mobilize foreign funds and added that some of the inflows which are expected to
realize soon include $2.1 billion from Multilateral Banks, $500 million from friendly
countries, $200million for earthquake relief, $100million from DFID, $700million
from MCB Bank’s stake sale, $100 million from Barclays Bank and the rest through
private sector GDRs and other regular sources.

She said that the Government is also taking measures to control inflation and
added that the central bank will continue to remain in a monetary tightening phase.

Given these facts, SBP Governor said: “Current rupee volatility is not reflective
of the macro-economic fundamentals.” She said that she is perplexed over recent Inter-
Bank market behavior and urged banks to play a proactive role to kill negative
sentiments in the market. She said that the central bank has made timely and effective
interventions in the market and added that any future interventions by the central bank
will be in accordance with its analysis of the situation. The Central Bank is vigilant of
the situation and will take the necessary steps as the situation warrants.

“Had we not intervened effectively, the exchange rate would have been at a
different level, but present level doesn’t reflect fundamentals” she added.

SBP Governor urged the bankers to educate their clients, including importers
and exporters, about true macro-economic fundamentals and play their role to bring
stability in the Inter-Bank market, which is not only in the interest of the country but
banks as well.

With a view to facilitate the general public and other stakeholders in obtaining
fresh currency notes before Eid-ul-Fitr, the State Bank of Pakistan has decided that all its
field offices and commercial banks’ branches throughout the country will issue one
packet each of Rs.5/- and Rs.10/- denominations fresh currency notes to one person
from their counters once during the Holy month of Ramazan on production of original
Computerized National Identity Card along with a copy of it.

SBP field offices will start issuing these currency notes from 2™ Ramazan-ul-
Mubarak while commercial banks’ branches will issue fresh currency notes from 7"" of
Ramazan till the last working day before Eid-ul-Fitr (or until the stock ends).

Commercial banks shall also provide fresh notes of other denominations to their
account holders and clients as per their transactions and the stock position. State Bank
has made arrangements for ensuring adequate supply of fresh notes to the commercial
banks for use in ATMs for the convenience of general public.

These steps of the State Bank of Pakistan will help eliminate the black marketing

financialsector refom s.

Presiding over a m eeting of the Presidents/CEO s of banks at the State Bank of

the industry to strengthen the business prospects as adequate capital buffer helps raise
depositors and public confidence, while allow ing industry to acheve the desired asset

SBP issues Draft Guidelines on
Islamic Financing for Agriculture

A Task Force constituted by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, on
“Islamic Agricultural Finance” has prepared draft Guidelines on Islamic Financing for
Agriculture. The Task Force comprised senior State Bank’s officials, Shariah Advisors and heads
of agriculture departments of commercial banks.

The draft Guidelines issued by the State Bank today are aimed at facilitating Islamic
banks as well as conventional banks involved in agriculture financing and having Islamic banking
licence in developing specialized Islamic financing products to meet the financial needs of the
farming community.

The draft Guidelines broadly cover Islamic modes of financing like Murabaha, ljara,
Musawamah, Salam, Istisnaa', Musharakah, Diminishing Musharakah, Mudarabah, Musaqaat,
and Muzara’at that can be used for meeting the financing requirements of farm and non-farm
sector activities including livestock, fisheries, poultry, orchards etc. The draft Guidelines also
cover Islamic financing for production purposes i.e. working capital and term finance for
purchase of agri implements, farm mechanization & development, transportation, etc. The
application and procedure to be adopted under each Islamic mode of financing for agriculture
have also been provided in the Guidelines to facilitate the implementation of the Guidelines.
The Guidelines will facilitate Islamic Banking Institutions (IBls), particularly those which are
extending their branch network and outreach in the rural areas, to develop their own products
to meet the financing needs of agri/rural community in a Shariah-compliant manner. These
Guidelines also suggest that the conventional banks with Islamic Banking Branches may offer
these products through Islamic Banking Windows by using their conventional branch network.

It may be mentioned here that the farming community at various platforms and
individually have always been demanding Islamic financing for agriculture purposes. However,
there is lack of awareness of Islamic Modes of Financing among conventional agri. financing
bankers and IBls are also naive to the requirements and business cycles of agriculture sector.

SBP is playing an active role in developing an enabling environment for agricultural
financing through conventional banking system and at the same time is committed to support
the development of Islamic Banking in the country. The initiatives of SBP have paid dividend in
the form of robust increase in agricultural credit disbursements from Rs 39 billion in FYOO to Rs
212 billion in FY08. Islamic banking is also robustly expanding in the country and almost all
major conventional banks have opened their stand-alone Islamic Banking Branches (IBBs) in
addition to six full fledged Islamic banks operating in the country. So far 313 branch licences
have been issued in the country. Islamic Banking Institutions are expanding their network in
rural areas through separate branches and windows.

STATE BANK DISPELS MEDIA REPORTS ON FCY ACCOUNTS

The State Bank of Pakistan has categorically dispelled the impression created by
some media reports that the SBP enjoys excessive power to take action against any
person who maintains overseas foreign currency account beyond US$ 1000 under
Foreign Exchange Regulations Act (FERA) 1947.

A SBP Spokesman in a statement issued today also denied media reports that the
State Bank had promised to provide cash liquidity at PKR80/US$ to Exchange
Companies at all the times.

Explaining the factual position, the Spokesman pointed out that in terms of
Government’s Notification No.SRO.1016(1)79 of October 1979, Pakistani nationals
resident in Pakistan were not allowed to hold more than US$1000/- abroad in their
Foreign Currency Accounts (FCY A/Cs). The same was incorporated in Para-9 of the
Chapter VI of FE Manual (8th Edition-2002). However, subsequently Protection of
Economic Reforms Act, (PERA) 1992 was promulgated which provides complete
freedom to an individual to bring, hold, sell, transfer and take out foreign exchange
within or outside Pakistan. This legislation has a categorical overriding effect over
Foreign Exchange Regulations Act (FERA) 1947. Since provisions in above referred
SRO of 1979 and PERA 1992 became contradictory, the issue was taken up with the
Government. Accordingly, SRO of 1979 which restricts Pakistani nationals from holding
more than US$1000/- in FCY account abroad was withdrawn by issuance of
Government’s SRO No. 984(1)/2003 of October 11, 2003. With the promulgation of the
said SRO, the restriction of holding not more than US$1000/- abroad does not stand valid
any more.

Regarding the issue of penalties on account of violations of Foreign Exchange
Regulations, the Spokesman clarified that due to contradictory legislations in place as
pointed out above, it has become difficult for the Central Bank to effectively monitor and
supervise foreign exchange activities as PERA 1992 has an overriding effect over FERA
1947 and all other laws. As an example to explain the effect of this, it may be noted that
under FERA 1947, an individual cannot take out of the country an amount more than
US$ 10,000/- in cash whereas PERA 1992 provides complete freedom in this respect.

As regards imposition of monetary penalties on account of violations of foreign
exchange rules & regulations, the Spokesman pointed out that at present there is no such
provision in FERA 1947. Accordingly, the only option available with SBP is to go
through a complex and lengthy adjudication process. This issue becomes graver where
immediate action is required against the Banks and Exchange Companies particularly
when evidence is found on rising speculative activities in forex markets. Under such
circumstances, the only recourse available with SBP is to suspend / cancel licences of the

State Bank issues Branchless Banking Regulations

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued Branchless Banking (BB) Regulations,
which will be applicable to all banks including Islamic and Microfinance banks with
immediate effect, with a view to encouraging innovation and increasing outreach of the
banking system.

The objectives of these Regulations are to define Branchless Banking activities as
a new delivery channel to offer banking services in a cost effective manner; to broadly
outline activities which constitute BB and to provide a framework for offering BB
services and to serve as a set of minimum standards of data & network security, customer
protection and risk management to be followed by the banks desirous to offer mobile
banking services.

According to these regulations, only authorized Financial Institutions (FIs) can
provide Branchless Banking services. Before applying for such an authorization, FIs
should thoroughly prepare themselves in the light of these regulations. The process
should start from top level strategic decision of entering into branchless banking
activities. Once the decision is made, preparation of necessary policies & procedure
manuals, strengthening of existing risk management & audit functions as required and
identification of partners, service providers and agents should be done. The FI may then
approach SBP for a formal authorization to conduct BB.

Banks wishing to provide branchless banking services or to bring in substantial
changes in underlying technological infrastructure shall submit to the State Bank, an
application describing the services to be offered / infrastructure modifications and how
these services fit in the bank’s overall strategy. This shall be accompanied by a
certification signed by FIs President/CEO to the effect that the FI has complied with the
some minimum pre-conditions including; an adequate risk management process is in
place to assess, control, monitor and respond to potential risks arising from the proposed
branchless banking activities; a manual on corporate security policy and procedures
exists that shall address all security issues affecting its branchless/e-banking system, in
line with these regulations; a business continuity planning process and manual have been
adopted which should include a section on electronic banking channels and systems.

These regulations have been issued as part of the broader strategy to create
enabling regulatory environment to promote Bank-led Model of branchless banking.
However, as financial institutions cannot take on BB without the help of other market
players like telecom companies, technology service providers, agents etc., knowledge of
these regulations is also helpful for other parties to understand their roles and
responsibilities.

Under these regulations, permissible BB models and activities have been outlined.
At present only bank-led model of branchless banking is allowed at present which may be
implemented in different ways. Firstly, it can be implemented either by using agency
arrangements or by creating a joint venture between Bank and telecom firm/non-bank.
Further, the mobile phone banking which make up for large part of branchless banking
can be implemented by using one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many models or

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has urged the
commercial banks to promote Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) financing

more aggressively.

Addressing the first meeting of the SME Credit Advisory Committee

Dr Akhtar stresses need for integration
of South Asian economies

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today stressed the
need for sustained efforts to achieve a common platform for integration of South
Asian economies to facilitate timely trade payments and remittances.

Dr Akhtar was addressing the opening session of the qe quarterly meeting of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Payments Council
(SPC) meeting held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi.

SBP Governor appreciated the progress made by the SPC since its
establishment in mid last year. The idea of having a regional payment initiative in the
SAARC region was originated at the SAARCFINANCE Conference on ‘Towards a
Regional Payment Group’ held at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in July
2007. The Governors of the SAARCFINANCE Group approved the proposal for
establishing a SAARC Payments Initiative (SPI) at its 16"" meeting held in Washington
in October 2007.

The SPI is a regional forum created by central banks /monetary authorities of
SAARCFINANCE Group to have common understanding and cooperation to help each
other to move forward in reforming their national payment and settlement systems
(PSS) and also to establish an appropriate regional payment system that facilitates
trade and investment flows in the region. The vision of SPI is to create an efficient,
robust, stable and convergent payments system for the SAARC region that
benchmarks with international standards. SPI is led by the SPC, an apex body
responsible for policy making with regard to the activities of SPI.

The 4"" quarterly meeting of SPC was chaired by Dr Ranee Jayamaha, Deputy
Governor of Central Bank of Sri Lanka, who is also the chairperson of the council.
Other representatives who attended the meeting were Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy
Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Bir Bikram Rayamajhi, Deputy Governor, Nepal

Appropriate measures essential to insulate Asia from

international financial markets turmoil: Dr Akhtar

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that Asia’s inherent
strength and resilience allowed the region to withstand turmoil in the international financial
markets but appropriate policy responses are critical to contain the impact of such external
shocks.

Dr Akhtar was delivering a lecture on ‘Asia: Impact of Recent Global Developments and
Central Bankers’ Response’ in Madrid, Spain yesterday where she was invited by Emerging
Markets Newspaper, a part of Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc., to deliver a keynote
address. In line with its tradition, Emerging Markets Newspaper invites the central bankers of
the region, who have won an award for the region's best central banker, to deliver the keynote
lecture in an event organized on the side lines of the Asian Development Bank’s Annual General
Meeting held in Madrid. Dr Akhtar was conferred with the ‘Best Central Bank Governor for
Asia 2007’ award by the Emerging Markets Newspaper.

Dr Akhtar said that Asia’s inherent strength and resilience remains intact supported by
all-time high reserves being fed by surpluses in external current account boosted regularly by
robust export growth which in case of net oil exporting countries has received additional impetus
from oil export revenues. “This has allowed the region to withstand these shocks but
appropriate policy responses are critical to contain the impact of these shocks,” she asserted.

SBP Governor said there is now a broad consensus that slowdown of US and Europe is
likely to have a more distinct impact on Asia. “Impact has been slow to filter down to Asia in
2007, but is predicted to impact 2008 economic growth,” she said and added that Asian
slowdown is driven largely by set-backs to IT exports, electronic and certain categories of
exports whose impact is now being felt by these industries. With nontraditional export and
diversification of trade to newer markets, Asian exports did grow in a number of countries by
double digit, she said.

Dr Akhtar said that the size and scale of interaction between Asia and America brings
immeasurable benefits when the going is good, but it will also bring a measure of misery when
the economy is in trouble. “Asian central banks and governments need to better integrate with
each other to mitigate and hedge such risks in the future, take advantage of the higher returns,
and take part in the developments in their own region,” she opined.

the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions that have been written off. In the financial
sector, the steepest decline was registered in securities markets that were fast to recover with the

SBP Governor discusses Banking Sector Strategy with bankers

The State Bank Governor, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar called upon Presidents of all commercial banks
to make concerted efforts to increase access to financial services in the country. She was
chairing a meeting in which she launched the future banking sector strategy paper.

The strategy paper for banking sector reforms over the next decade has been formulated by the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) after intensive consultation with the stakeholders including
valuable feedback from the foreign reputable experts. The Banking Sector Strategy (BSS) is
centered on reforms involving the SBP and the banking sector, which constitutes not only the
core of the financial system in Pakistan but is also central to the monetary and financial stability
responsibilities of the SBP. The BSS focuses on reforms that the SBP has the power and
resources to implement or substantially influence and highlights a set of priority areas in which
progress needs to be made in the next ten years. The ten key priority areas for the BSS are to:

(i) Implement a financial inclusion program for banks to meet the needs of underserved
economic subsectors, including outreach programs to meet the requirements of the
agriculture, housing, SME and microfinance sectors.

(ii) Strengthen consumer protection through new legislation, codes of conduct and new
institutional arrangements and improve financial education through educational
outreach programs.

(iii) Strengthen competition and efficiency in the banking sector with more transparency,
more diversification with new products and delivery channels as well as measures to
reduce the market distortions created by the large banks in rural areas.

(iv) Further strengthen and consolidate the banking sector by continued efforts to raise
governance and risk management standards, higher capital requirements and resolution
of underperforming commercial and specialized banks.

(v) Strengthen prudential regulations and supervision by updating banking legislation and
regulations, methods of supervision, and stricter enforcement of prudential rules for all
banks, including state-owned ones.

(vi) Introduce a framework for consolidated supervision and reorganize the regulatory
architecture to allow better regulation and supervision of financial groups and
conglomerates.

SBP Governor’s briefing on State of Pakistan Economy
to Senate Committee on Finance

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today stressed the need for
aggressive implementation of anti-inflation policies which will provide relief to the general
public and restore investors’ confidence.

While giving a presentation on ‘State of Pakistan Economy’ to the Senate’s Standing
Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs and Statistics in Islamabad, Dr Akhtar
emphasized that fiscal sustainability is a key factor for macroeconomic stability, which requires
increase in tax-to-GDP ratio; containment in non-productive expenditures and expanding
public-private partnership. She said that there is also a need to increase exports through
diversification of products and markets and enhancing productivity while imports need to be
curtailed through containing aggregate demand.

Dr Akhtar said that inflationary trends in the country will settle as the global inflation
has come down and Government has reiterated its commitment to achieve net zero borrowing
from central bank. Decline in fiscal deficit to sustainable level and low inflation can play an
essential role in improving saving rate, she added.

SBP Governor said additional funding needs to be secured to meet the Current Account
Deficit which will require i) increase in savings to reduce reliance on external financing, ii)
restoration of investor’s confidence to encourage investment inflows and restrict outflows and
iii) consistency and continuation of prudent policies. She said that with the inflow of $3.1 billion
from the International Monetary Fund, the country’s foreign exchange reserves climbed back to
$9.4 billion by November 26, 2008.

Dr Akhtar gave a detailed account of the country’s current economic situation in the
backdrop of global financial crisis and highlighted issues, challenges faced by the economy.
While referring to SBP’s recent decision to raise its key policy rate to 15%, she said that under
the current situation further monetary tightening was necessary to ease demand pressures and
ensure long-term growth on sustainable basis.

She said the move will create room for government to borrow from market sources,
improve rate of return on savings, control inflationary expectations and stem second round
effect of inflation, check depletion of foreign exchange reserves and depreciation of exchange
rate. She, however, mentioned that even after the 200-basis-point increase in the policy rate,
current real interest rates are negative and credit to private sector remained strong.

She pointed out that with the adjustment in interest rates and other policy measures,
the rupee has appreciated by 3.6 percent during end October to November 25, 2008.

State Bank to provide 100% refinancing to banks under EFS: Dr Akhtar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar today announced that the central
bank will henceforth provide 100% refinancing to banks against export finance provided by them
to exporters under Part-I of the Export Finance Scheme (EFS). Earlier, the State Bank was
providing export finance to the banks upto 70 percent.

Export finance already provided by banks under Part-I of EFS from own sources at the ratio of
30 percent and outstanding as on 31% October, 2008 shall also be refinanced by the State Bank
for the remaining period of individual loans, the Governor said.

It may be pointed out that in order to ensure adequate flow of credit to exporters, SBP has taken
various initiatives in the recent past. At the beginning of the current financial year, Governor,
State Bank has already increased Banks’ limits under EFS by 25% to fulfill the credit need of
exporters. However, it was observed by the State Bank that various banks are feeling difficulty in
providing financing facilities to exporters due to exhaustion of limits under the Export Finance
Scheme and increasing requirement of credit due to exchange rate depreciation. Therefore, it has
now been decided by the State Bank Governor to resolve the issues regarding financing
requirements of both the exporters and the banks by providing 100% refinancing to banks under
EFS.

Financing under EFS is a subsidized source of finance from SBP involving a subsidy of about 8
percent for exporters to enable them to compete in the international markets to boost exports
from the country. As the funds provided under EFS involve huge subsidy from SBP, Exporters
Associations have been advised to ensure rightful use of funds by their members through self
regulating mechanism, in addition to the regulatory mechanism put in place by SBP to prevent
misuse of financing.

It may be recalled that the State Bank monitors the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy
and takes required measures to meet adequate credit requirements of any sector, in particular, the
credit requirements of exporters. SBP has also recently taken various measures including the

reduction in CRR/SLR requirements to enhance the liquidity of the banking system.

SBP to review LC margin requirement
for essential raw materials: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that
the central bank in consultation with the Government will look into the
demands of the industry of exempting essential industrial raw materials from
mandatory 35% cash margin requirement on opening letters of credit (LCs) to
facilitate the industry.

She made these remarks while talking to a delegation of the Federation
of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), which called on her
at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this afternoon.

Representatives of the FPCCI apprised the SBP Governor of the
problems being faced by the industry after the introduction of cash margin
requirements, saying that the industry is facing the problem of shortage of
working capital.

Dr Akhtar assured the delegation that the central bank will look into the
matter and asked FPCCI to submit a list of raw materials for consideration of
the State Bank and the Government. “We are working diligently for the
betterment of the economy and the industry....we have always accommodated
the industry and will do so in future as well,” she remarked.

During the meeting, SBP Governor explained in detail about the
rationale behind taking recent interim monetary policy measures and said the
150 basis points increase in the discount rate has been necessitated by the
persistent and excessive government borrowing from the SBP to meet the financing
requirement of the budget deficit. Stock of government borrowing from SBP is more
than double of last year’s level and in order to offload this huge debt to the
scheduled banks, this rate hike will act as a critical measure to induce the scheduled
banks to participate actively in T-bill auctions.

Dr Akhtar also highlighted measures taken by the central bank to stabilize the
exchange rate and said that the since the interim monetary policy measures
announcement, the Pakistan rupee has appreciated over 3% against the dollar in the
inter-bank market.

Mr. Tanvir Ahmed Sheikh, President FPCCI, said that they now have
better understanding about State Bank’s actions and assured that the industry
will fully cooperate with the central bank.

Trade & Industry Hail SBP’s Policy Initiatives

The representatives of trade and industry have generally appreciated the policy
measures announced by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan yesterday.

During a meeting with Dr Akhtar today at the State Bank of Pakistan, trade and industry
representatives hailed the provision of 100% refinancing to banks against export finance
provided by them to exporters both under Part | & Il of the Export Finance Scheme and Long
Term Financing Facility (LTFF) for Plant & Machinery to promote real investment in the country.
They also appreciated the initiative of the SBP to have a combined meeting of stakeholders
from banking and industry. However, some of the businessmen opined that the rise in discount
rate may hurt the local industry.

Dr Akhtar explained the move was necessitated because the country’s economic
indicators have come under stress due to the impact of global commodity price hikes combined
with a persistent rise in aggregate demand pressures. Both factors have resulted in rising fiscal
and external account deficits during FYO8 beyond sustainable levels, she said and added that
these trends generated inflationary pressures.

Representatives of the trade bodies also made some suggestions for revival of the
economy and removing bottlenecks in the flow of credit to various sectors of the economy. SBP
Governor assured the participants that every effort will be made to meet the credit needs of
productive sectors for growth of the economy. Going forward, State Bank will also further
strengthen its mechanism for monitoring liquidity requirements and will take appropriate
actions to meet multiple demands of financing.

Regarding procedural issues relating to refinance scheme, Dr Akhtar said that she has
constituted a committee comprising of the representatives of SBP and Pakistan Banks’
Association (PBA) to make recommendations in this regard. The Governor advised bankers not
to indulge in driving interest rates and exchange rate based on mere sentiments and rumors.
Further, bankers should also take necessary measures to arrest the declining growth of
deposits.

A representative of the PBA explained to the participants about the mechanism through
which Karachi Interbank Offered Rates (KIBOR) are set every day.

The representatives of the banking industry reiterated the view of the Governor that
there are demands of credit from all the sectors and they will support the industry for its revival
and meet their credit needs particularly of productive sectors within manageable risks.

The meeting was attended by the representatives of trade bodies/exporters
associations and chief executives of banks. The participants from trade / industry included
FPCCI, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Overseas Chamber of Commerce & Industry
and the representatives of various exporters’ associations representing textile, rice, hosiery,

towel, bed wear and readymade garments sectors.

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

 

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar today issued the
following press statement:

“Pakistan is committed to exchange rate stability. There is no doubt that demand
pressures have been high in the economy as manifested by the high fiscal and external
current account deficits.

Since Pakistan has a managed floating exchange rate regime, the demand and
supply of foreign currency sets the market exchange rate. Over the last few weeks, there
has been slowdown in inflows relative to outflows. Central bank has been supporting the
oil payments and other obligations of the Government as well as providing the necessary
support to the market as and when required. However, the central bank is not in
businesses of distorting markets by setting one level of exchange rate. As such our
interventions have to be calibrated in line with the level of volatility.

In the last few days, volatility in exchange rate has undoubtedly been enhanced,
but we need to fully understand what is really happening. The inter-bank and kerb
markets’ behavior have not been in line with market fundamentals but reflects distortions
created by trading and speculative practices which often do creep in under circumstances
like this. It is important to reiterate that SBP is committed to exchange rate stability and
does take appropriate actions against any irregular practices, which are aimed to
destabilize the markets for personal gains. However, it is important for me to outline
sequentially how SBP has attempted to stabilize the exchange rate.

First, the central bank has been working closely with the Government to set in place
a macroeconomic framework to ensure its sustainability. In addition, we are taking
concrete steps to ensure effective supply of foreign inflows. In discussions with
multilateral agencies and other sources, there is a broad agreement for their support
which should be able to bring in quick disbursement of foreign exchange inflows.
Furthermore, the Government is looking at other options to attract foreign inflows. We
are optimistic that these inflows will start pouring in the next few weeks which should
settle the supply and demand dynamics more sustainably in the markets.

Second, we have been and are ready to supply the necessary liquidity and
lubrication to the markets through calibrated intervention.

Third, we have enhanced our vigilance of the interbank and kerb markets. This
vigilance is unearthing some issues which are being addressed. At one point since the
kerb and interbank market rate differential rate was higher, in consultation with the
exchange companies; we agreed to provide them with some liquidity which was received
well by markets. Now, we are working with the exchange companies and have kicked
off reforms to ensure that they serve Pakistan’s interest effectively.

Impressive GDP growth vindicates

economy is resilient: Dr Akhtar

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, said today that despite multiple shocks,
the country’s economy has managed to record economic growth of 5.8%, which is above the average
growth trend of 5% observed between FY91 and FYO8.

She stated this during her visit to Karachi Stock Exchange where she was invited by the KSE
Management to address a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), senior
stock brokers and heads of commercial, investment banks. This was her first visit to KSE since
assumption of office in 2006. The meeting facilitated a constructive dialogue on the current economic
situation and the future prospects of the stock market.

Dr Akhtar said the stock market of the country showed a remarkable performance since 2000 in
terms of market capitalization and growth of indices. The KSE registered more than 1000 percent
increase in market capitalization and over 900 percent increase in the index since FYOO. The index, which
stood at 1,520 points, with total market capitalization of Rs. 394 billion ($6.5 billion) in FYO0, grew by
leaps and bounds in the last few years and reached the level of 15,676.34 points by April 18, FY08, with
total market capitalization of Rs. 4,790.98 billion ($75 billion). “This growth surpasses the market
performance of major economies in the region, as a result of which KSE-100 index was included in the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index from June 2006,” she added.

She said that Pakistan stands out in Asia for allowing foreigners to own 100% of any asset in any
sector, and are not subjected to any ownership limits or discriminatory taxes on dividends in the
secondary market. At current valuations, the stock market offers an attractive option to investors, both
domestic and foreign.

In response to a question, she clarified that the central bank’s Prudential Regulatory
Framework is largely supportive of exposures to the stock market, and that within the existing
regulations, banks have the aggregate capacity of an incremental amount of Rs. 40 billion to invest in
the stock market, if they wish to do so. SBP has also extended the deadline for banks’ total stock
market exposure not to exceed 50% of their equity to 30"" June, 2009.

However, she pointed out that stock markets should do more to mobilize resources for the
industry by encouraging more and more corporate listings as the banking sector is still unduly burdened
with meeting the bulk of the financing requirements of the economy. She also pointed out that equity
market lacks depth, and continues to be small and narrow. There is also high price volatility and the
trading is largely speculative. “Therefore, there is a need to increase market base and reduce
speculation,” she added.

Dr Akhtar said that listed commercial banks constitute around 26.5% of the KSE-100 index, and
31.6 percent of KSE-30, and are major drivers of growth in market volumes. Though the market
capitalization of the commercial banks dropped in July 2008 as compared to its Dec 2007 levels, the
performance of banking system remained healthy in CY08, she added.

understanding of IFSB approved prudential standards.

There was a broad recognition in the Council Meeting that the Islamic banks have preserved the
shocks of global financial market turmoil well. The IFSB secretariat and the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB) will be working together to assess further the implications and
lessons learnt from the global financial market turmoil for Islamic industry.

The Council Meeting also discussed the future of IFSB and recommended measures for
strengthening its financial position. The Council Members appreciated the continued support of
IFSB for standard setting and the efforts launched to disseminate these standards. They also
requested for greater interface with the industry.

The meeting was comprehensive and covered a broad range of topics of mutual interest to
Council Members and Islamic financial industry. Pakistan is holding the IFSB Chair for 2008
and the Governor of Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) will be taking over the Chair of
IFSB in 2009.

IFSB is an international standard-setting organization that aims at promoting and enhancing the
soundness and stability of the Islamic financial services industry by issuing global prudential
standards and guiding principles for the Islamic financial industry. It has 175 members that

Textile Sector receives Rs176 billion under EFS
in three quarters of FY08

The State Bank of Pakistan and commercial banks have provided a sum of Rs 273 billion under
the Export Refinance Scheme (EFS) to all eligible export-oriented sectors during the first three quarters of
FY08, out of which an handsome amount of Rs 176 billion or 65% was availed by the textile sector at
7.5% - lower than ongoing 6-month Karachi Inter-Bank Offered Rate (KIBOR) of around 10.32%.

It may be mentioned here that the above-mentioned amount is equivalent to the amount provided
to the Textile Sector during the same period of FY07. Likewise, textile sector has also availed over Rs 4
billion during the same period as a long-term financing at 6% to 7%, which is even below ongoing EFS
rates. The SBP has also sanctioned an amount of Rs 8 billion under its newly-announced Long Term
Financing Facility (LTFF) for disbursement to the textile sector during January-June 2008. The funds so
far disbursed under this scheme have been availed by the textile sector.

It may also be added here that during the period from FY 03 to December 2007, the State Bank
has provided refinance amounting to Rs 897.5 billion to the Textile Sector under EFS at the mark up rates
which were below the ongoing market rates providing sufficient savings to the sector. Further, Textile
Sector has availed refinance amounting to Rs 54 billion under Long Term Financing for Export Oriented
Projects (LTF-EOP) Scheme since its inception in May 2004 to February 15, 2008 at a fixed rate of mark
up of either 6% or 7% for the full tenure of the loan which can extend up to 7-1/2 years.

The above-referred facts are sufficient to dispel an impression, created by a news item published
in a section of the press, that the SBP Governor while addressing a meeting of Federation of Pakistan
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) recently has refused provision of financial assistance with
low mark up for textile industry.

It may be pointed out that pursuant to release of the monetary policy statement for January — June
2008, the State Bank held many focused discussions with the stakeholders including FPCCI. During these
meetings and discussions SBP explained that the monetary tightening was carried out to contain macro
economic imbalances creating inflationary pressures in the economy.

As regards provisions of low mark-up financing to the textile industry, it is reiterated that textile
sector has always been one of the major beneficiaries of the incentives provided by the SBP in the shape
of its various Schemes i.e. EFS, LTF-EOP, LTFF. The value-added sectors of the Textile Group have
remained the major beneficiaries of the refinance granted under these schemes.

Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that the SBP is not providing long term financing to the value
added textile sector; in fact LTTF is available to value added sector including Fabrics, Garments, Made
up, Towels, and Art silk & synthetic textiles sub sectors of Textile Sector.

SBP Governor chairs meeting of bankers / brokers

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Shamshad Akhtar presided over a meeting of bankers
and stock brokers at SBP Karachi this afternoon. The meeting discussed a number of proposals
regarding financing against shares to brokers and decided that the existing facilities of “Financing
against Shares to Members of Stock Exchange” outstanding as on 31* August 2008 will be
converted into a Term Finance Facility of one year. Borrowers, during the term of the facility, can
repay the amount but no fresh disbursement under this facility will be allowed.

It was also decided in the meeting that in addition to shares, the banks may also accept other types
of collateral like residential plots, houses, etc. to secure existing financing against shares to
brokers. This additional collateral may be provided by brokers if the value of marketable securities
is not sufficient or to create sufficient cushion in the margin in case of further market decline. The
objective of this arrangement is to avoid unnecessary margin calls in case of market decline during
first few days after the removal of floor on 27"" October, 2008.

At present, the exposure against shares is subject to a minimum margin of 30%. Banks are
required to give a margin call when the margin breaches this limit. It was decided that while at the
start of the facility the minimum margin may continue to be 30%, but banks may not give a margin
call until the margin breaches 25% limit.

It was agreed in the meeting that banks may also consider accepting the membership card of
brokers as collateral subject to the fulfillment of all requisite legal formalities and necessary
approvals.

The banks have been given two limits for exposure against shares:

a. Ready market (20% of the equity for banks; for Islamic banks and for DFIs which are
mobilizing deposits, the limit is 35%)
b. An additional 10% against exposures in Futures contract.

The meeting also approved the proposal to combine the two exposures limits, with a proviso that
exposure in Futures will not exceed 10% of equity. This will provide some room for banks to
increase their ready market exposure provided their Futures contracts exposure is lower than 10%.

The decisions taken in the meeting will save the market from chaos and uncertainty in case of
further decline and facilitate the stakeholders to play their due role in the development of capital
market. The changes being brought out in the regulatory framework as a result of these decisions
will provide necessary flexibility to both lenders and borrowers to adjust their respective positions
with ease and comfort.

It may be recalled that State Bank Governor, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, held a series of meetings
during the last few days with bankers and brokers in an effort to arrive at an amicable solution of
the stock exchange crisis.

Financial Globalization has the potential to promote and
reinforce Islamic Financial Industry: Dr. Akhtar

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the
Islamic financial services industry needs to consolidate itself to be able to better
compete with global players through achieving scale, efficiency and cost
effectiveness in addition to rapidly building its capacities to standardize regulation
and supervision and accounting practices, while strengthening the governance of
the industry.

Delivering her keynote address as the Chairperson of the Islamic Financial
Services Board (IFSB) for 2008 on ‘Financial Globalization and Islamic Financial
Services Industry’ at the 5th Annual Summit of the IFSB held in Amman, Jordan
yesterday, Dr Akhtar said that the Islamic Financial (IF) services industry has been
transformed from being a peripheral activity to a sizeable industry which is
attracting global interest.

She said that financial globalization will foster IF and given the inherent
features and richness of Islamic principles, modalities and products’ growth in IF,
will be beneficial for supporting the process of regional and global financial
deepening. Although currently the size of IF is small relative to the global
financial system, it has promising growth prospects, she added.

“Well developed and integrated Islamic money, capital, and foreign
exchange markets will not only be beneficial for borrowers and institutional
investors but can also further enhance the stability of IF institutions, providing
them with improved portfolio, liquidity and risk management tools,” Dr Akhtar
opined.

Referring to Sukuks, she said that the internationalization of the Sukuk
structure and its flotation, which is expected to hit the $100 billion mark soon, is
helping to better integrate IF with the world of global finance.. This will not only
meet the region’s massive infrastructure project financing requirement but will
also help diversify financial markets, Dr Akhtar added.

SBP Governor said that financial globalization has grown in size and scale
and there is now a broad consensus that an effectively-managed financial
globalization has the potential to benefit from and contribute to growing world
trade integration, easing of investment and cross-border capital flows as economic
liberalization gains momentum, development of interdependent production
structures, that have evolved to maximize comparative advantage, and the
revolution in information technology and institutional reforms.

However, she said the recent financial market turmoil in the subprime
mortgage market has unfolded itself in an unprecedented global liquidity crunch,

Dr Akhtar launches ten-year
Financial Sector Strategy

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan today said that SBP is launching a
ten-year Financial Sector Strategy with an explicit objective to help country achieve higher and
sustainable economic growth; develop a dynamic, robust and stronger banking system;
mobilize the domestic and foreign resources for private investment and deepen the financial
penetration for poor and underserved regions.

She made this announcement while addressing the Development Finance Conference
on ‘Expanding Frontiers of Financial Access in Pakistan’ organized by SBP at its Learning
Resource Centre in Karachi on the eve of 60"" Anniversary of the State Bank of Pakistan.

The Conference, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, was attended, among
others, by Sindh Governor, Dr Ishratul Ibad, Sindh Chief Minister, Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Federal
Finance Minister, Syed Naveed Qamar, Federal Minister for Labour, Manpower and Overseas
Pakistanis, Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Finance,
Revenue and Economic Affairs, Ms. Hina Rabbani Khar and Special Assistant to Prime Minister,
Ms. Shahnaz Wazir Ali.

“This vision that we are articulating, will take forward the banking sector to new heights,
building on the outstanding performance of the sector in a short span of 4-5 years,” she added.

Dr Akhtar said that the objectives of the Financial Sector Strategy will be to broaden and
deepen the financial system to help Pakistan to:

(i) Achieve higher and sustainable economic growth,

(ii) Develop a dynamic, robust and stronger banking system,

(iii) Mobilize the domestic and foreign resources for private investment (which has

to be the key driver of the economy), and

(iv) Deepen financial penetration for the poor and underserved regions.

She said that prerequisite for financial sector growth, however, is macroeconomic and
political stability and augmentation of the enabling policy environment in the real sector.
“Assuming these preconditions are restored, the ten-year strategy will stimulate sharper
growth in financial assets and aims to double the private sector credit/GDP ratio,” she asserted.

SBP Governor said that the strategy would be financially inclusive, supporting the small
savers and meeting the requirements of small borrowers in the agriculture, housing, SME and
microfinance sectors. It would aim to modernize the wholesale and retail markets and reduce
the systemic risks of the financial system by developing an adequate safety net for the small
depositors, while reforming the regulatory architecture to ensure that the central bank can play
an effective regulatory and supervisory role, she added.

No reforms are complete without also ensuring further strengthening of the central
bank, she said and added that in this context, the State Bank has worked to modernize the
central bank legislation in line with the international best practices.

“Ours is one of the oldest laws in the world and as such it includes some outdated
provisions, even though the law has served the central bank well in delivering several of its
functions, with a fair degree of autonomy under the oversight of its Central Board of Directors,”

SBP Governor expresses satisfaction over the credit
disbursement to the Agriculture Sector

 

Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan reported to the
Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) the progress of banking sector in
delivery of credit to agriculture sector. The overall credit disbursement to the
agriculture sector during the first half (July-December, 2007) of the current fiscal year
has been good and based on the achievements, it is hoped that the indicative
disbursement target of Rs 200 billion for the year will be achieved.

She made these observations while chairing the mid-term review meeting of
ACAC, held at State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today. The meeting was informed that
banks have disbursed a total of Rs90.3 billion to the agriculture sector during the first
half of FY08 as against Rs 71.7 billion disbursed in the same period last year,
showing an increase of Rs 18.6 billion or 26 percent. The overall disbursement during
July-December, 2007 is about 45 percent of the full year target and is in line with the
percentage achieved during the same period last year.

It may be mentioned here that the ACAC in its annual meeting held on 10""
July, 2007 had set indicative agricultural credit target of Rs 200 billion for the fiscal
year 2007-08. The target was 25% higher than the previous year’s target of Rs 160
billion and 18.3% higher than the actual disbursements of Rs 169 billion. Out of total
credit of Rs 200 billion, Rs 96.5 billion was allocated to big five commercial
banks, Rs 35.5 billion to domestic private banks, Rs 60 billion to Zarai Taraqiati Bank
Limited (ZTBL) and Rs 8 billion to Punjab Provincial Cooperative Bank Limited
(PPCBL).

The meeting was also informed that five big commercial banks (ABL, HBL,
MCB Bank, NBP and UBL) as a group disbursed Rs 44.9 billion, ZTBL Rs 23.9
billion, domestic private banks Rs 19.1 billion and PPCBL Rs 2.4 billion as against
disbursements of Rs 34.3 billion, Rs 24.2 billion, Rs 10.2 billion and Rs 3.0 billion
respectively in the same period last year. Percentage share of five big commercial
banks and domestic private banks in total disbursement increased from 48% to 50%
and from 14% to 21% while the share of ZTBL and PPCBL declined from 34 % to
26% and from 4% to 3 %, respectively.

The province-wise disbursements during July-December, 2007 depict that the
share of Sindh in total disbursements has improved from 9.9% to 11.3 % over last
year whereas the disbursements to other provinces remained almost at the same level.
Disbursements in Sindh have increased by Rs 3 billion or 44% to Rs 10.2 billion as
compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The sector-wise disbursement shows
that the share of non-farm sector has increased to 27% from 13% during the first half
of FY08. To facilitate and encourage banks to focus on non-farm sector, SBP has
taken a number of initiatives which include issuance of guidelines for livestock &
fisheries financing, horticulture financing and recently designed a financing scheme
for small farmers based on group lending methodology.

The meeting dwelt at length on ways & means to further enhance the outreach
of the rural financing and came up with several proposals in this regard.

Dr Akhtar said that the State Bank is taking a number of initiatives for
financial inclusion of rural population and in this regard it has developed a
microfinance strategy in collaboration with the stakeholders. A key to enhancing

Rs 358 billion will be available to exporters
under EFS during FY09

Funds amounting to Rs 358 billion would be available to exporters for the export of products
eligible under the Export Finance Scheme during FY09 as the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Dr
Shamshad Akhtar has decided to increase the overall quantum of export finance for banks under this
Scheme.

In order to ensure availability of adequate financing to the exporters under the Export Finance
Scheme (EFS) and to assist them in achieving the exports target, the State Bank of Pakistan would
allow limits of Rs 125 billion to the banks under the Scheme for the current year which are 25%
higher than the amount outstanding as on 30"" June 2008. As loans under the Scheme are allowed for
180 days, therefore, around Rs.250 billion would be provided during the year as refinance from the
State Bank at the rate of 7.5%. In addition to this, banks would also provide financing facilities to the
exporters under the Scheme from their own sources, to the extent of 30%, which comes out to Rs 108
billion, at the same rate of 7.5%. Commercial banks have been brought on board further on this
sharing mechanism.

Furthermore, in order to ensure timely availability of financing to exporters, the State Bank has
also advised the banks that in future, financing requests from exporters under EFS should not be
turned down, which otherwise are meeting the requirements of EFS and lending criteria of the
respective bank. State Bank would regularly monitor the behavior of banks in optimal utilization of
limits and if a bank is unable to fully utilize its allocated limit, its unutilized limit would be allocated
to other banks.

It may be added here that the State Bank of Pakistan and commercial banks have provided
export finance to the exporters during FY 08 at 7.5% which is substantially lower than ongoing 6-
month KIBOR (at present around 13.5%). Further, SBP has also provided refinance amounting to Rs 6
billion under its Long Term Financing for Export Oriented Projects (LTF-EOP) Scheme to the
exporters during FY08, at a fixed rate of mark up of 7% for a period from 2 years to 7-1/2 years.
Moreover, during the period from January to June 2008, SBP and banks/DFIs have also provided an
amount of Rs 1.134 billion under the Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) to the exporters for a
period of up to 10 years at concessional rate of mark up.

All the above measures taken by SBP are aimed at ensuring adequate supply of financing to
exporters at concessional rates of mark up to enable them to compete in the international markets to

boost exports from the country.

State Bank to launch Special Pilot Project to
improve access of agri credit on fast track: Salim Raza

The State Bank of Pakistan is launching a Special Pilot Project in Sindh from the
current kharif season to improve the availability of agricultural credit to the farmers
on fast track basis.

Disclosing this while presiding over the mid-term review meeting of the
Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) at SBP, Karachi today, the State Bank
Governor, Syed Salim Raza said that the Pilot Project will initially be launched in seven
agri. intensive districts of Sindh including Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas,
Larkana, Sanghar, Nawabshah & Khairpur. He said that the project which is being
launched from 15‘ March will be participated by 13 different banks having agri.
designated branches in these districts. He said that SBP’s Pilot Project will help to
increase outreach of agri. credit to underserved areas of Sindh and added that the
banks are meeting 47 percent of the total credit requirement of farmers. The rest is
being met through informal resources.

He said that during July-January 2008-09, commercial banks have disbursed Rs
117 billion, against the full-year target of Rs 250 billion. The disbursement is higher by
Rs 12 billion than the disbursements of Rs 105 billion in the same period last year. He
said that major chunk of the credit i.e. Rs 81 billion or 70 percent was availed by farm
sector mainly for production purposes whereas share of non-farm sector has also
increased by Rs 8 billion during the period under review.

Salim Raza said that share of subsistence holding farmers (small farmers) in agri.
loans disbursement has increased to Rs 51 billion or 64 percent from Rs 46 billion or
60 percent during July 2008 to January 2009. Similarly, for economic holding farmers
the share has risen to 18 billion or 23 percent from Rs 17 billion or 22 percent
whereas the share of above economic holding farmers reduced to Rs 11 billion or 14
percent from Rs 14 billion or 18 percent.

He also informed the participants that non-performing loans of agri. loans have
declined to 17 percent in Dec. 2008 from 20 percent in Dec. 2007 as a result of
improved overall recovery rate of 76 percent in Dec. 2008 from 71 percent in Dec.
2007.

Regretting the trend of uneven geographical distribution in agri. credit
disbursements, the SBP Governor urged upon the commercial banks and other

Economy shows signs of improvement as
fiscal discipline improves: SBP Report

Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators have started to show improvement due to
disciplined implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program as a result of which
aggregate demand has seen a meaningful contraction, according to the Second Quarterly
Report of the State Bank of Pakistan on the State of Economy released today.

The Report pointed out that demand pressures in the economy are easing due to
improvement in fiscal discipline which has complemented a tight monetary policy. “This has
improved prospects for low inflation; while inflation is still very high, there is an expectation
that it will decelerate sharply in the final quarter of the fiscal year,” it added.

The Report further pointed out that there is a distinct improvement in the external
sector, with a fall in the cumulative July-February period of 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9) trade
deficit, which is the first reduction for this period in seven years. The narrowing trade deficit
and robust remittances have also engineered a reduction in the current account deficit,
allowing for a buildup of the country’s foreign exchange reserves, it added.

The Report said that it is hoped that a continued compression in the imports, principally
attributed to weakness in domestic demand and lower import unit values will reduce the
current account deficit, allowing Pakistan to build-up foreign exchange reserves.

It projected that during the current FYO9 fiscal year, the country’s economy is likely to
expand between 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent and annualized inflation is expected to be around
19.5 percent to 20.5 percent whereas overall fiscal and current account deficits are likely to be
between 4.3 percent to 4.7 percent and 5.8 percent to 6.2 percent of the GDP, respectively.

The Report said the fiscal consolidation has been a major priority under the
macroeconomic stabilization agenda for FYO9 which seems to be having an impact as the fiscal
deficit for the first half of FYO9 is estimated to have dropped to 1.9 percent of projected annual
GDP compared to 3.4 percent in H1-FY08. “The fiscal deficit for H1-FYO9 thus appears to be in
line with the annual target set in the budget FYO9 as well as that agreed with IMF under the
Stand-By Arrangement,” it added. The fiscal improvement thus far has largely been brought
about by elimination of oil subsidies and a cut in development spending.

Similarly, the Report pointed out that after a sharp deterioration in July-October period
of FYO9, overall external account balance improved noticeably in the ensuing months, aided by
a sharp fall in the current account deficit and a modest recovery in financial inflows.

Pakistan’s banking industry has
tremendous potential: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan today said that Pakistan’s banking
industry has tremendous potential for further investment in the financial sector of the country.

Inaugurating the third branch of Barclays Bank in Karachi at Khayaban-e-Shahbaz, Mr
Raza said that continued interest of international investors in the banking industry of Pakistan is
a good omen and it reflects the immense potential of the country, specifically in the financial
sector.

“Given the current economic scenario, where we are faced with many difficulties, it is
comforting to see expansion in the financial sector, which is a manifestation of confidence of
foreign investors,” Mr Raza added.

SBP Governor said that development in the financial sector over the years has led to
increased competition, product offerings, and diversification of business activities which, in
turn, not only benefitted local consumers but financial institutions as well.

“The country’s banking system effectively coped with several challenges emanating
from the economic slowdown both at home and abroad due to strong regulatory and
supervisory frame work as well as strong resilience built over the years,” Mr Raza observed.

He emphasized that banks should expand their outreach to serve vast unbanked areas
of the country and added that Barclays’ focus on rural sector is the correct way to proceed and
expand operations in Pakistan. He hoped that Barclays’ expertise and global network will be an
added benefit to the local customers and wished its management all the success in their future
endeavours.

Speaking on the occasion Mr Mohsin Nathani, Managing Director and Country Head,
Barclays Bank Pakistan said: “Barclays is committed to investing in Pakistan with a long term
view. In eight months since our launch we have established relationships with customers
through our growing presence in the major cities of Pakistan. Furthermore, we are offering our
services in Mangla and Rawat as per our commitment to provide banking facilities in rural
areas.”

The inauguration ceremony was attended, among others, by Mr Robert Gibson, British
Deputy High Commissioner to Pakistan, besides senior officials of the State Bank and Barclays
Bank Pakistan.

It may be mentioned here that Barclays Bank, which commenced its operations in
Pakistan last year, is a part of the global Barclays Group and employs over 500 people, serving
more than 9000 customers and clients across Pakistan through a network of 30 ATMs, nine

branches and 10 sales and service centres.

State Bank directs all banks to ensure
basic banking facilities for IDPs

The State Bank of Pakistan has directed all commercial banks to provide basic banking
services including cash withdrawal facility to internally displaced persons (IDPs) as a result of
the current situation in Swat and other adjoining districts.

It is mandatory for all banks having branches in affected areas to arrange their presence
in each relief camp through all or any means as provided in the Branch Licensing Policy and
ensure access of IDPs to their bank accounts through opening of booths, temporary shifting of
Branch(es), installation of ATMs, temporary ATM facility/Mobile ATM and Mobile banking
facility.

It may be mentioned here that a large number of internally displaced persons (IDPs)
displaced from Swat and other adjoining affected districts have been compelled to seek shelter
mainly in the relief camps located in Districts of Mardan, Swabi, Charsadda, Nowshera and
Peshawar. Many of them are account holders of various banks branches located in these areas
and some of them are in possession of their cheque books/ATM Cards etc. but could not
withdraw money or avail other banking facilities due to dislocation and non-availability of
banking facilities in the relief camps.

In this backdrop, the State Bank has advised all banks to immediately arrange for
provision of basic banking services which, interalia, include cash withdrawal facility to IDPs.

Commercial banks have also been advised to display banners/posters in the relief camps
about the banking facilities arranged for IDPs, wide spread publicity of such arrangements
should be made through Electronic and Print media for maximum awareness of IDPs enabling
them to get full benefits from the banking facilities arranged for them.

The concerned banks have been advised to immediately take necessary steps and report
compliance to the State Bank, says BPRD Circular No. 8 issued to the Presidents / Chief

Executives of all banks / Islamic banks / microfinance banks today.

Pakistan’s banking industry continue to remain
resilient despite economic downturn: SBP Report

Pakistan’s banking industry was able to maintain its resilience and showed improvement
in key solvency indicators despite current economic situation in the country. However, due to
deterioration in macroeconomic indicators, the credit risk remained high.

According to Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking System for quarter ended
March 31, 2009 released today by the State Bank of Pakistan, the aggregate Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) under Basel-IIl framework, for all banks improved to 12.9 percent (13.3 percent for
commercial banks). The CAR improved to 13.8 percent jointly for banks and Development
Finance Institutions (DFls). This improvement was largely caused by reduction in risk-weighted
assets, improvement in capital markets leading to appreciation in the value of available-for-sale
investments and satisfactory earnings.

Asset base of the banking system grew 1.6 percent over the quarter to reach Rs 5,744
billion. The asset mix, however, witnessed a significant shift from advances to investments in
Government papers and government-guaranteed debt securities that are relatively risk free and
liquid. Resultantly, the liquidity profile further improved as compared to the second half of the
year 2008 when the system faced a significant liquidity shortage, says the Report.

According to the Report, the heightened credit risk transpired in significant increase in
Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). However, even in the face of constraining factors, the banking
system earned before tax profit of Rs 26.2 billion for the March, 2009 quarter that was higher
compared with Rs10.5 billion in Dec-08 quarter, though lower than corresponding quarter of
2008.

The Report pointed out that Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) of the banking system
increased to Rs 379 billion (Rs 313 billion in Dec-08) giving infection ratio of 11.5 percent and
net infection ratio of 3.9 percent, the Report said. NPLs are covered by the loan loss provisions

SBP Deputy Governor urges banks to follow
risk management fundamentals in letter and spirit

Mr.. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that the current global financial
crisis signifies the importance of risk management in financial institutions and urged upon the commercial
banks to follow risk management fundamentals in letter and spirit.

Addressing a conference on ‘Effective Risk Management in a Changing Environment’ which was jointly
organized by International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the State Bank in Karachi today, Mr.. Anwar said the
present turmoil in the financial sector provides an opportunity to learn from the financial world’s mistakes and
overzealousness.

“This gives us the opportunity to look back and see what went wrong and structure our own financial
houses so that this does not happen to us, or so severely affect the world again,” he said and added in this the
most significant lesson that has been learnt from recent events is the importance of fundamentals in risk
management. “For instance there is a basic rule since inception of banks which says ‘do not put all your eggs in
one basket’. Had this simple rule been followed, many institutions could have avoided huge losses,” he asserted.

Mr. Anwar highlighted some fundamental principles that form the cornerstone of risk management and
said that if these principles are followed in letter and spirit they can shield financial institutions from significant
losses. He said these rules are simple and equally applicable on small institutions but simple means these are
simple to understand; nevertheless implementing some of these fundamentals can be quite difficult.

Talking about the key principle of governance, Mr. Anwar said that a sturdy risk management
framework in any institution cannot be established unless it is given due recognition by its board and senior
management. Risk Management is not just a regulatory compliance issue; it is the apparatus that will help you
deal with the peril on your way towards achieving organizational objectives.

He said that the purpose of a Risk Analysis Team is to have impartial and unbiased assessment of risk
with no favoritism towards any business unit and its unbiased dissemination to the senior management and
board. Obviously this can be accomplished only if the function is independent of risk units of the organization
and which reports directly to the CEO regularly and the Board periodically, he added.

However, Mr. Anwar said that the independent Risk Analysis Team can only be effective if they have
influence in day to day operations of the institutions. In this regard, the support of the Board and CEO is a
prerequisite. I would suggest two things, firstly the stature of Chief Risk Officer (CRO) should be equivalent to
the other business units and secondly there should be frequent dialogues between the CRO and senior
management (CEO & Heads of various business units), he added.

He said that while it is important to have an independent Risk Analysis Team, one cannot absolve the
business units of their responsibility in relation to risk management. Risk Management can be durable if it is
entwined in the overall culture of the organization, he said and added that people who are taking risks must
know the risks and rewards associated with the transactions they are undertaking and the risk appetite as well as
the tolerance limits. Therefore the risk managers in each business unit must understand how their independent
risk management within their division integrates within the entire organization. Similarly, Mr. Anwar said that
an important element of risk management is the establishment of risk discipline and oversight to insure that
additions to or changes in the asset liability mix are consistent with the overall plan.

Mr. Anwar asserted that a reliable and respected information system is the foundation of risk
identification and measurement. He said timely availability of accurate information is essential to have
meaningful assessment of risk. “I acknowledge that many banks realized its importance and invested
significant resources in improving their IT systems,” he added. He said that besides accurate information and
frequent dialogue with business units, institutions need to take into account a few other things while designing

Tremendous potential exists for
branchless banking: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that tremendous
business potential exists for branchless banking in the country which allows financial
institutions and other commercial players to offer alternate and economical financial
services outside the bank premises.

Speaking at the inauguration of branchless banking product ‘Easy Paisa’ - a joint
effort of Tameer Microfinance Bank and Telenor Pakistan - at a local hotel in Karachi this
afternoon, Mr. Raza said that the State Bank has always encouraged innovation and
provided enabling regulatory environment in order to drive the banks to increase their
outreach. “As a regulator, we are concerned about the un-banked masses of our country
that do not have banking facilities,” he said and added that branchless banking is a
milestone to substantially increase the financial services outreach to the un-banked
communities.

He said the banks have started to show interest in branchless banking and SBP
has given regulatory approval to three banks to carryout branchless banking business.
Six banks have been given approvals to offer cell-phone base banking services to their
existing customer base as an alternate delivery medium, he said and added that there
are many other banks in initial discussions with SBP on their proposals to start
branchless banking.

SBP Governor said that developing an inclusive financial sector is a top policy
priority area for the State Bank. He said that in the recent past, complete transformation
of the banking industry, supported by privatization and restructuring and market-
oriented policies, has resulted in broadening, deepening and diversifying financial
services. “Yet, financial penetration remains quite low — with only 26 million depositors,
7 million borrowers, and over 20,000 people per bank branch in Pakistan,” he said and
added that a significant majority are unable to access even the simplest financial
services, meaning that they pay more to manage their money, find it harder to plan for
the future and cope with financial pressures, and are more vulnerable to financial
distress and over-indebtedness.

He said in this context, leveraging technology and finding innovative products
and delivery channels, such as mobile phone banking, is the best way to increase

Emerging economies should spur growth to
weather global financial crisis: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that developing
countries will have to stimulate their domestic economies, increase their capacity to
consume surplus production in the wake of shrinking exports and achieving sustainable
growth to effectively weather international financial crisis.

Speaking as a Chief Guest at a lecture on “Financial Meltdown and Global
Economic Recession: Causes and Effects” organized by Karachi Council on Foreign
Relations, Economic Affairs and Law (KCFR) at a local hotel in Karachi today, Mr Raza
dwelt at length over the causes and effects of the ongoing crisis in the international
financial markets. He said that in the wake of global financial meltdown, emerging
markets have suffered a sharp fall in demand for their products, whether commodities
or manufactured goods as major economies have contracted, and a sharp slowdown in
private capital flows to the order of over $500 billion between 2007 and 2009 has taken
place.

He said Pakistan had not been adversely affected by the global financial crisis as
the rest of the world. Nevertheless, one impact of the global financial meltdown is that
private inflows of the order we witnessed until 2007 have dried up. “The implication is
that the role of multilateral inflows has become all the more important. And, the fact
that our macroeconomic stabilization program is on the right track will help these type
of flows to materialize speedily,” he said.

Mr Raza said that Pakistan’s economy is likely to grow between 4%-4.5% in the
next fiscal year. Responding to a query, he said the inflation is likely to be in single digit
in the next fiscal year. He said that the Federal Government has successfully
implemented macroeconomic stabilization program and added that we have been able
to meet all the targets of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Raza also appreciated
the role of IMF in the macroeconomic stabilization of Pakistan.

SBP Governor said the pledges of $5.28 billion made at the recently concluded
Friends of Pakistan meeting in Tokyo show the confidence of international community
over economic performance of the Government.

Mr Raza said that how emerging markets are going to adapt themselves to the
changing scenario will depend partly on how the major economies strategically respond

SBP issues ‘Guidelines on Islamic Financing for Agriculture’

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued “Guidelines on Islamic Financing for
Agriculture” to help banks develop specific Shariah compliant products in order to meet the
financing needs of the farming community. These Guidelines have been developed in
consultation with stakeholders while keeping in view the potential and demand for Islamic
banking products in the field of agriculture.

The Guidelines broadly cover Islamic modes of financing like Murabaha, Ijara,
Musawamah, Salam, Istisna, Musharaka, Diminishing Musharaka, Mudaraba, Muzara’a,
Musagat, and Mugharasa that can be used for meeting the financing requirements of farm and
non farm sector activities including livestock, fisheries, poultry, orchards etc. In addition to
these financing needs, IBIs may also refer to SBP guidelines and instructions for crop and
non crop sector activities like guidelines on livestock, fisheries, poultry, horticulture, etc to
make further progress on this front. Moreover, the Guidelines have also explained the
application and procedure of the Islamic modes of financing.

The State Bank has advised all the banks to use these guidelines for developing their
own Shariah compliant products for extending finance to agriculture sector according to their
policy and operational & market requirements, subject to compliance with SBP regulations
and approval from their Shariah Advisor.

The Guidelines will facilitate Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs), particularly those
who are extending their branch network and outreach in the rural areas, to develop their own
products to meet the financing needs of agri/rural community in a Shariah compliant manner.
The conventional banks with Islamic Banking Branches may offer these products through
Islamic Banking Windows by using their conventional branch network.

Under the Guidelines, individuals/ partnership concerns and all types of legal entities
engaged in agriculture related activities, having sufficient knowledge and relevant experience
are eligible to get financing under the Islamic financing scheme. As per Prudential
Regulations for agriculture financing, these guidelines shall not include financing to traders
and intermediaries engaged in trading/ processing/ grading/packaging/marketing of
agricultural commodities. Such financing will fall under Corporate/ Commercial or SME
financing and will be subjected to compliance of corporate/ commercial/ SME regulations.
However, financing under the guidelines can be extended to entities ( including corporate
firms, partnerships, and individuals) engaged in farming activities as well as processing,
grading, packaging and marketing of mainly 75% of their own horticulture produce.
Financing facilities may be extended, provided IBI is satisfied with the capacity of the
customer /sponsor to manage and run the horticulture activities subject to the following
conditions:-

e Customer should be a holder of computerized NIC while usual requirements for
corporate clients would apply.
e Customer should not be a defaulter of any IBI / financial institution. This condition

Salim Raza announces reduction in SBP policy
rate to 14% on positive inflation outlook

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan disclosed today that the
central bank has decided to lower its key policy rate by 100 basis points to 14 percent
with effect from April 21, 2009.

Addressing a press conference at State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi on the
occasion of the release of Monetary Policy Statement for the April-June quarter of
the current 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9), Mr Raza said the decision to reduce the key
policy rate has been taken on the basis of assessment that inflation will continue to
decline.

Mr Raza said the country’s economy has made a steady progress on its path
towards macroeconomic stability. He pointed out that CPI inflation (Year-on-Year),
though still higher than desired, has declined to 19.1 percent in March, 2009 from a
high of 25.3 percent in August, 2008. Persistent demand pressures, as depicted in
core inflation measures, have also eased, he said and added that the 20-percent
trimmed core inflation has come down by about 2.4 percentage pionts from its peak
in October, 2008. Although the projected average CPI inflation for FY09 is around 21
percent, expected inflation of around 14 percent for Q4-FY09 and 8 percent for FY10
illustrates a positive outlook, he maintained.

Mr Raza said that improved fiscal discipline and contraction in the external
current account deficit indicate that aggregate demand is showing a downward trend.
“This will help narrow the output gap and strengthen the positive outlook for
inflation,” he added. Referring to recent fiscal developments, he said that fiscal deficit
of Rs 251 billion (1.9 percent of projected GDP) for H1-FY09 and the Government’s
commitment to cap it at Rs 562 billion (4.3 percent of projected GDP) for the entire
FYO9 is a very significant improvement over last year’s 7.4 percent.

Likewise, he pointed out that external current account deficit has narrowed to
$172 million in March, 2009 compared to a deficit of $2.2 billion in October, 2008,

showing much improved trends in the external sector. He said that cumulatively, the

MTB Q3 auctions not
to cause liquidity crunch

Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) Auction target of Rs 565.0 billion announced by
the State Bank of Pakistan for the January-March quarter of the current 2008-09
fiscal year will not cause any liquidity crunch in the inter-bank market.

It may be pointed out that against the total market maturities of MTBs/OMOs
amounting to Rs 541.8 billion, the MTB Auction target of Rs 565.0 billion has an
incremental amount of only Rs 23.2 billion for the whole of third quarter in which six
fortnightly MTB Auctions would be conducted by the State Bank. Total maturities for
the quarter include Rs 517.8 billion MTB maturities and Rs 24.0 billion against OMO
maturities.

According to the breakup, MTB maturity inflows in January, February and
March are Rs 122.07 billion, Rs 239.05 billion and Rs 156.654 billion, respectively.
While an inflow of Rs 24 billion against OMO maturities is due in January, 2009.

Therefore, in the context of this relatively low incremental amount for the
quarter, the announced quarterly MTB auction target is neither ambitious nor it will

cause liquidity crunch in the inter-bank market.

Slowdown in globalization to affect
emerging markets: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said the current global economic
crisis may result in slowdown in globalization and added that the most painful consequences of
this would be felt by the emerging markets and the developing world.

Speaking at the MAP Corporate Excellence Awards Ceremony held at a local hotel in
Karachi today, Mr Raza said the emerging economies are suffering from loss of export markets
and withdrawal of foreign direct investment as capital is retained and repatriated. “The
slowdown and reversal could be long, and would by itself slow or even reverse the movement
out of poverty, and limit the middle class expansion we were seeing,” he added.

However, Mr. Raza reiterated that Pakistan has been less affected by the current global
crisis as the country’s banks are well capitalized and their assets and liabilities are squarely
domestically based. He said that compared with other Asian economies, which heavily rely on
exports to developed world, Pakistan is less affected because of its limited exports and low
exposure in the international financial markets.

“With inflation coming under control, and with a huge domestic market, we could very
usefully produce more for domestic economy, and take the opportunity to develop domestic
commerce and domestic brands,” he suggested.

SBP Governor said that the current financial crisis has overwhelmed the whole global
story since the early 1980's wherein deregulation, liberalization, privatization resulted in
financial globalization which was achieved not only by growth but also through cost effective,
innovative and efficient supply chains.

Mr. Raza advocated economic managers should devise strategies to retain the positive
effects of globalization that transformed the world and to ensure a balance in the economic
management to allay the fears of emerging markets that current global crisis may result in state
control of capital; trade protectionism and restrictions on immigration.

Mr. Raza said that globalization has achieved a cut in global production costs as
manufacturing shifted to cheaper overseas bases, prominently China and also other Asian
countries. This kept costs down, dampened inflationary pressures for the U.S. consumer, and
the fact that the Balance of Payments surpluses generated by exports would be reinvested in
the U.S. kept the dollar strong, and supplied liquidity that kept interest rates low. He said the
U.S. financial sector debt grew from 22% in 1997 to 117% in 2008, and to 230% in the
U.K., while U.S. household sector debt grew from 66% of GDP in 1981 to 100% in 2008. The U.S.
in the 2000s was absorbing 70% of the world’s savings.

“In the U.S. we had over-borrowed consumers, financial institutions and the
Government, while private markets are largely to blame, excess leverage was significantly made
possible by the U.S. Fed keeping interest rates low, and ignoring consequent real asset
inflation,” he said and added, anyhow, the bubble burst and the consequences are before us.

Banking system continues to show resilience
against major risk factors: SBP Report

Pakistan’s banking industry continued to show the resilience against major risk factors
through improved solvency position, according to State Bank of Pakistan’s Quarterly
Performance Review of the Banking System for the quarter ended June, 2009.

“The banking system continued to show the resilience against major risk factors, though
the heightened credit risk remained a major source of concern for banks,” says the Review
Report released today. It said the growth in non-performing loans (NPLs) pacified and deposit
after showing some stagnancy witnessed strong growth of 8.2 percent during the quarter.
Banks posted pre-tax profit of Rs 28.6 billion during the first six months of the year 2009 while
risk-based capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for banks improved to 13.5 percent in April-June,
2009(12.9 percent in Jan-Mar, 2009).

“This improvement in CAR was caused by growth in equity as well as reduction in Risk
Weighted Assets as the banks shifted their asset mix from private sector credit to less riskier
lending to public sector and government papers,” the Report pointed out.

It pointed out that the asset base of the banking system grew by 6.0 percent over the
quarter to reach Rs 6,087 billion. The asset mix, however, witnessed significant change as banks
continued to focus on government papers and lending to public sector. A 5.0 percent growth in
advances was mainly contributed by lending to public sector for commodity operations and
Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). However, due to heightened credit risk as well as private
sector’s low demand for credit, banks’ lending to private sector declined by 1.8 percent, the
Report said.

According to the Report, NPLs grew by 4.9 percent over the quarter and infection ratio
stayed at 11.5 percent. However, due to increased loan loss provisions, net infection ratio
decreased to 3.7 percent in June, 2009 (3.9 percent in Mar09) and provisions covered 70
percent of the NPLs. The higher loan loss provisioning during the quarter nonetheless affected
the earnings. Pre-tax Return on Assets of 1.7 percent though lower than the levels of
corresponding periods of last couple of years, was higher than the entire year results of CY08,
the Report added.

SBP issues operational guidelines
for credit card business

The State Bank of Pakistan today issued comprehensive operational guidelines for credit card
business of commercial banks/DFls, outlining code of conduct for various aspects of credit card
operations including their marketing, interest rate charges, recovery of dues, billing processes etc.

According to the guidelines, banks/DFls are advised to quote interest rate and service charges on
annual basis. Although, they are free to set the aforesaid rates, banks/DFls are required to set well-
defined service level for each of the product/service; whether charged or free. Banks/DFls should
also inform the credit card holder on the interest rate or services charges through advertisement
and/or sending information to card holders on their addresses.

Banks/DFls should not levy any charge that was not explicitly mentioned either in the User Guide
or Application Form or Schedule of Charges provided to the customer at the time of selling credit
card, without the prior consent of the card holder. However, this would not be applicable to excise
duty or other charges which may be levied by the Provincial or Federal Government or any other
statutory authority from time to time. Banks/DFls should, however, timely update the customers on
the imposition of such levies. Banks are also advised that interest amount should be charged on net
credit i.e. after deducting the amount paid by the card holder. The outstanding amount due to
rounding-off of paisas, should not be considered as partial payment and interest amount should not
be charged on it.

According to the guidelines, banks/DFls must ensure that their recovery/collection officers
should not resort to any verbal or physical harassment of the delinquent credit card holder, their
family members, referees and friends during recovery/collection efforts. Recovery/collection officers
should also not humiliate publicly or in private or intrude the privacy of the credit card holder’s
family members, referees and friends. Telephone calls and visits to credit card holders for recovery
of unpaid dues should be restricted to a convenient time and the same may be defined in the
Bank/DFls public policy and should be properly communicated to customers at the time of issuance
of credit card. In addition, recovery should only be made from principal card holder and in no case
supplementary card holders shall be resorted to any sort of pressure to pay the unpaid amount.
However, supplementary card holders may be contacted only to enquire about the whereabouts of
the principal card holder. Moreover, banks/DFls should not start recovery process for reported
disputed transactions until the investigation carried out by card-issuing Bank/DFI/Banking
Ombudsman/State Bank of Pakistan is completed. In case of wrong/ inappropriate basis of rejection
of customer claim, bank/DFI would be liable for penalty.

With regard to marketing of credit cards, banks/DFls should discourage aggressive and hard
selling & marketing practices during working/office hours; except with prior appointment of the
prospective customer. In case a customer is called during office hours for seeking appointment,
he/she should be first asked for the option to continue with the call or not.

Banks/DFls should seek prior consent of their customers/account holders for informing them on
new products and services on telephone as and when introduced. In this regard, banks should
maintain a “Don’t call list” comprising the contact details of those customers who do not want to be
contacted. The list should be accessible to all marketing staff and they should be advised not to
contact such customers /account holders for introducing or offering new banking products. In this
connection, banks should update the database of existing customers within three months from the
date of issue of these guidelines. Banks/DFls should follow the Code of Conduct for marketing of
credit cards which will be issued by Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA) in consultation with SBP.

services to the otherwise excluded poor and marginalized population including
women and young people.

He said the State Bank of Pakistan has taken a number of measures to

by the World Bank’s Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). The
Consultative Group said that the State Bank has one of the most conducive policy
and regulatory frameworks which encourage access to financial services.

GOVT. & SBP COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING
MACRO ECONOMIC STABILITY: SYED SALIM RAZA

Syed Salim Raza, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the Government and the
SBP are committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability and long term economic growth in
the country.

Speaking at the Excellence Awards Ceremony of CFA Association of Pakistan at a local
hotel in Karachi tonight, he said the primary goal of monetary policy stance is to control
inflation.

Mr Raza observed that the downward trend in domestic inflation owes to favourable
international and domestic developments as well as a deceleration in domestic demand. ‘The
latter, in particular, reflects the monetary tightening by the central bank as well as the
complementary improvement in fiscal discipline’, he added.

Stressing the need for the development of an efficient bond and money market, the SBP
Governor said the development of an organized bond market for both Corporate and
Government securities is the need of hour that will help boost intra-regional trading liquidity
and investment needs.

SBP Governor said that complementing the progress of the bond and money markets
will be further strengthened by bringing efficiency in secondary trading platforms, liquidity,
dissemination of price & volume trends and wider access to the market. He said the work is
underway on these initiatives at the State Bank to create a vibrant and liquid Bond Market thus
reducing the financial intermediation cost in the system.

He observed that Pakistan’s financial markets have remained by and large insulated
from the recent global financial market turmoil as ‘our markets did not have exposure to
mortgage or other asset backed securities.’ However, he asked all stake holders to further
consolidate their efforts for the deepening of financial sector including financial instruments
innovation.

In view of the rapidly changing situation, the SBP Governor impressed upon the
commercial banks to focus on products development and enhance their financing facilities to
infrastructure, housing, SME and microfinance industries as well as expand their outreach to
under-banked regions. ‘Banks will need to poise themselves to meet demands of the investors
and industries for continued growth’, Mr Raza added.

SBP taking several initiatives to boost
SME financing: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan today said the central bank has
taken a number of initiatives for the promotion of SME financing in the country.

Addressing a press conference at the launching of a Pilot Program for Training
and Development of SMEs in Pakistan under the aegis of Standard Chartered Bank and
International Finance Corporation of the World Bank at Lahore Chamber of Commerce
and Industry this afternoon, Mr Raza stressed the need for enhancing the access of
credit to small and medium enterprises, especially the small entities.

He urged upon commercial banks to increase financing to SMEs, especially small
entities, enabling the SME sector to play its due and critical role in the economic
development of the country.

“\f SMEs are broadly bifurcated into ‘M’ and ‘S’ categories, we find that entities
under ‘M’ have had easy access to finance as compared to those under ‘S’,” he said and
added the synopsis of SME Finance also reflects that out of total SME portfolio of
Rs. 383 billion, only 38.3 per cent is being channeled to entities having less than 20
employees.

“This depicts that the focus of financial institutions has been on medium
entities,” he said and added the primary reason for this skewed distribution was the
unorganized way of doing business by small entities.

Referring to major hurdles in the way of development of SMEs in Pakistan,
Mr Raza said that major issues faced by SMEs are: lack of skilled labor, outdated
technology, weak governance, lack of management hierarchy, absence of book keeping,
taxation issues coupled with limited access to formal sources of finance.

He said the State Bank has allowed commercial banks to lend up to Rs 3 million to
SMEs without collaterals and is encouraging them not only to introduce cash-flow based
methodologies instead of relying on the tradition collateral based lending but also to
come up with innovative products and cost effective delivery channels to increase
outreach for small enterprises.

He said the State Bank is also working for capacity building of banks through
launch of SME Finance Grass Root Cluster Training Program for credit officers based in
SME Clusters that include Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Quetta

Prof. Levine highlights importance of
macroeconomic models in monetary policy formulation

Dr Paul Levine, Professor of Economics at Surrey University, United Kingdom has argued
that the use of various macroeconomic models in the formulation of monetary and fiscal
policy will continue to be an essential component of the policy procedures followed by central
banks and finance ministries in both developed and emerging economies.

Delivering a lecture on “Monetary Policy in an Uncertain World: Probability Models and
the Design of Robust Monetary Rules” at a local hotel in Karachi today, Dr Levine said that
current global economic crisis has highlighted the centrality of uncertainty and robustness for
both policymakers and modellers. Inevitably economists differ in their theoretical frameworks
and this is the most fundamental source of uncertainty, he added. “However, | would suggest
there has been a remarkable convergence in the profession towards a common methodology
based on firm micro-foundations and systems estimation,” he said.

The lecture, organized by State Bank of Pakistan, is the sixteenth such event held as a
part of Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture series instituted in 1973.

Dr Levine’s lecture addressed the role of macroeconomic models for real world policy-
making and provided a brief survey of the evolution of macroeconomic modelling strategies
over the past thirty or so years. He also discussed different approaches to robustness and the
concept of probability model. He also discussed in detail Dynamic Stochastic General
Equilibrium (DSGE) models of emerging economies and offered some suggestions for future
directions for research.

He asserted that policymakers must incorporate robustness with respect to model
uncertainty that takes into account the possibility that their modelling framework is wrong and
within each framework they must allow for the fact that they estimate parameter distributions
and not just their mode. With parameter distribution we have in effect a distribution of models,
he said. “Armed with a series of probability models across different modelling frameworks the
policymaker can now incorporate risk assessment and robust rules into the conduct of policy,”
he added.

Dr Levine said that there are a number of areas where DSGE models need developing,
especially for emerging economies. Until recently as with their Real Business Cycle
antecedents, the New Keynesian (NK) model forms still omitted involuntary unemployment. He
said that another major lacuna in the NK models has been the absence of a banking sector and
added the monetary transmission mechanism existed simply through one nominal interest on a
riskless bond, ‘set’ by the central bank. In the context of emerging markets he argued that
modeling the presence of the informal economy is another important direction for future
research and directly relevant for Pakistan.

State Bank to introduce electronic bond trading
platform early next year: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that the central bank intends
to introduce an electronic bond trading platform early next year. ‘This will provide investors
real-time information about market yields resulting in enhanced liquidity and better price
discovery in the fixed-income market’, he added.

Delivering a keynote address on “Developing the Next Generation Capital & Commodity
Markets Ecosystem in Pakistan: Creating Value & Inclusive Growth in the Society” at the South
Asian Federation of Exchanges (SAFE) Country Roundtable held at a local hotel in Karachi this
morning, Mr. Raza said that in the initial stage only sovereign paper will be traded on the
platform resulting in a liquid sovereign yield curve that would provide better representative
benchmarks for issuance of corporate debt instruments.

‘This platform will also help in shifting government debt from banks to other
institutional investors thus freeing up funds for private sector credit hence facilitating the
development of real economy,’ he added.

Mr. Raza said that the State Bank during the last decade has been at the forefront of
broadening not only the investment instruments and risk management tools but also
supporting the broadening of the participants that have a need to use these to address their
investment mandates.

SBP Governor said he believes that there is a room to accommodate more investor
groups in the local currency Government Debt program and one such group might consist of
investors currently accessing the National Savings Scheme (NSS). He said it would be more
efficient for the Government and the investors, to rationalize the issuance process. “This would
enable an improved pricing strategy, eliminating the need to give away embedded put options
which are available to investors at free of cost,” he said and added it will also provide higher
liquidity to the investors for their holding by making the debt fungible among all investors,
residents and non-residents, corporate and individuals.

Mr. Raza said that SBP feels that financial institutions have a significant role to play to by
taking on the role of financial advisors to the public in general. “This would include selecting
the appropriate mix of asset classes (equity, debt, commodity, real estate, etc.), setting
liquidity/maturity targets, tax planning services and provide their services of financial
intermediation to enable them to invest and rebalance their retirement/investment portfolios
periodically,” he added.

Salim Raza asks commercial banks
to increase SME financing

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today asked the commercial banks to
make concerted efforts to explore new avenues of business, especially financing to small &
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which play a critical role in employment generation and
poverty alleviation.

Presiding over the one meeting of the SME Credit Advisory Committee (SMECAC) held at
SBP, Karachi, Mr Raza highlighted importance of the SME sector and said: “SMEs play an
important role in the creation of employment opportunities with relatively lower investment
levels, help reduce poverty and propel economic growth which remain one of the prime
objectives of both Government of Pakistan and the State Bank.”

He pointed out that out of the total 3.2 million economic establishments in the country
around 99 percent of them employ 1-10 persons, clearly indicating that they fall under the
definition of SMEs, more specifically lower-end SMEs. The SMEs share currently in export
earnings is 25 percent and contribution towards gross domestic product has been around 30
percent, he added. However, he noted with concern that despite economic significance of
SMEs, they have not yet been able to avail due share of financing from the banks.

SBP Governor asserted that in the current economic situation banks will have to play
their due role in the promotion of economic growth. “We know these are difficult time....we
don’t want to strangulate banks and stop incremental credit growth,” Mr Raza said. He assured
banks that the central bank will even look into the possibility of ‘sensible relaxation’ of SME
prudential regulations in order to help banks promote SME financing.

Participants of the meeting highlighted several issues that are hampering SME financing
and proposed that separate prudential regulations be developed for small enterprises as these
small businesses have a huge potential for growth compared with medium-sized enterprises.

Mr Raza said that he recognizes that currently banks may be facing problems in keeping
their customers and more severely in luring new customers but the conditions of hardship are
in fact a testing phase for banks to prove their determination, resilience and business viability.
He said that he is aware that a number of demand and supply side issues are hindering the flow
of credit to the sector including lack of reliable information & documentation, cumbersome
lending procedures, lack of strategic focus by banks, human resource constraints, dependence
on collateral based lending, SMEs’ reluctance to disclose financial position and the banks’
perception that SMEs are high-risk customers. He urged upon banks and other stakeholders to
put forth new ideas and highlight areas which may be explored for further development of the
sector.

Mr Raza informed participants of the meeting that the State Bank is currently working
on establishing SME Credit Guarantee Agency in the country to share risk with the lending
institution, so that when borrowers default on a loan and thus incur a loss for the lender, the
lending institution will be compensated for all, or part, of the loss involved.

Risk-based CAR ofbanks in proves to 14 3%
by end -Septem ber: SBP Report

The risk-based capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of all banks operating in the country has
improved to 14.3 percent in the quarter ended September 30, 2009, according to Quarterly
Performance Review of the Banking System of the State Bank released today.

The Report said that the banking system shows strong capacity to withstand unusual
shocks in the major risk factors and chances of any systemic risk remains contained. “In the
wake of traditional pick up in the economic activity during the outgoing quarter, the credit
to private sector is likely to gain momentum,” it added.

It said that during the July-September, 2009 quarter, the overall profitability of the
banking system remained fair. However, the earnings were largely skewed towards large
and medium-sized banks as the bottom line of most of small sized banks was low or in
negatives. Banks posted aggregate pre-tax profit of Rs70.1 billion for the first three quarters
of the outgoing year with the Pre-tax Return on Assets of 1.6 percent (1.2 percent for CY-
08), the Report added.

SBP’s Report pointed out that accumulation of year-to-date earnings and equity
injections raised the equity base of the banking system. “This growth was also augmented
by improvement in revaluation surpluses on equity investments, and the leverage of the
system slightly came off,” it said and added that improvement in eligible capital and
reduction in Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) as the banks shifted their asset mix from private
sector credit to investments in Federal Government papers, improved the risk based Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR).

The Report said that asset base of the banking system with marginal growth
remained stable during the quarter under review. The deposits base, which grew
significantly during the last quarter, contracted over the quarter under review. On the asset
side, decline in advances took place in both public and private sector lending. However,
lending to private sector corporations in power & energy sector actually showed significant
growth.

It said the non-performing loans (NPLs) of the banking system after showing some let
up in the last quarter, again increased during the quarter under review, while the asset base
with shift in asset mix from advances to investments and decline in deposit base remained
stable. Due to increase in NPLs, the net infection ratio increased to 4.1 percent, the Report
added.

Monetary Policy Decision 24"" November 2009

SBP’s policy rate to be cut by 50 bps

A cursory look at key macroeconomic indicators shows substantial improvements on multiple
fronts. Inflation (YoY) has fallen to 8.9 percent in October 2009 and is expected to remain in the vicinity
of 11 percent by the end of current fiscal year. External current account has improved considerably,
positively altering its projected trajectory. With government borrowings from the SBP remaining within
the quarterly limits, the broad money (M2) has also remained contained along the projected path. The
real sector is also showing signs of improvement as the large scale manufacturing (LSM) stage a recovery
after a protracted declining phase. However, a close inspection of these encouraging developments
together with a pragmatic assessment of prevailing security situation in the country and fiscal
uncertainties invite caution and further analysis.

Recent month-on-month inflation changes in headline and core measures continue to be
volatile and on the higher side, oscillating between 0.5 and 1.7 percent in case of the former and
remaining stuck at 0.8 percent in case of the later. A reassuring fact is that the number of items in the
CPI basket showing higher monthly increases relative to an historical benchmark has come down
significantly. However, at the same time, the number of items displaying significant inflation persistence
has also increased, which indicates the probable entrenchment of second round effects of inflationary
process. The poor administration in the supply chain of some food items is not helpful either in
positively altering inflation expectations. A higher than projected fiscal deficit for FYO9 has also changed
some underlying assumptions for inflation outlook in FY10. In addition, the full impact of electricity and
gas price adjustments, a necessary part of fiscal consolidation measures, and recent resurgence of
international commodity prices, on the back of early signs of global economic recovery, remains a
source of uncertainty for inflation outlook.

Apart from influencing commodity prices, the recovering global economy is expected to revive
global trade and flow of liquidity across borders, which bodes well for Pakistan’s exports and private
financial flows. The recent strong inflow of workers’ remittances and a substantially improved external
current account deficit of $1.1 billion in the first four months of FY10 may allow Pakistan’s economy to
absorb the likely swelling of import bill induced by a nascent domestic recovery and higher international
oil prices. However, the strength and sustainability of its overall balance of payments crucially depends
on resumption of foreign financial flows. Of these, portfolio inflows have picked up, direct investment
has fallen, and official inflows, other than IMF, remain lower compared to projections. Looking forward,
the magnitude and timing of expected non-IMF foreign inflows remain uncertain and could increase the
challenges of SBP’s liquidity management and government’s budgetary financing.

Public sector’s steady borrowing requirements have the potential to raise the Net Domestic
Assets (NDA) of the banking system. Though broadly respecting the pre-announced T-bill auction

strengthening its robustness. The year 2008 did deviate from the economic trends set in the
last few years and original projections. This was largely because of the disruptions caused by
series of shocks that disrupted the progress achieved in past years. Despite multiple shocks, the
economy revived backed by appropriate and the continued demand management dosages and
other measures by the central bank. The banking system despite economic and stock market
shocks remained strong. Profitability remained good and non-performing loans while
registering growth remain within reasonable ranges and are effectively provisioned for.

Notwithstanding, economic challenges still remain complex and substantial. SBP continues to
strive for excellence and also for ensuring that central bank safeguards country’s economic and
social interests and augment the banking system’s robustness so that this sector can continue
to serve the national interest and meet the requirements of productive sectors and of the
public including poor and vulnerable. In order to set on record, this statement aims to
document the key milestones achieved in the last three years and highlight the emerging
challenges. These need to be read in conjunction with the central bank economic and financial
reports.

SBP Governor’s Press Statement

We have, in a difficult year, seen steady improvement in key indicators following continued
implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program. CPI inflation continues to fall,
government borrowing from the central bank remains within quarterly limits, and SBP’s foreign
exchange reserves have increased. These positives, in turn, reflect contraction in aggregate
demand, much-needed fiscal consolidation, and an improved balance of payments position.
Consistent with the gradual strengthening of macro fundamentals, the inter-bank money market
is functioning smoothly, the foreign exchange market has been stable within a tight range, and
deposit growth in the banking system is picking up.

However, these positive developments are not without costs. Exacerbated by electricity
shortages and security issues, real GDP growth has fallen to 2.0 percent in FYO9, down from 4.1
percent a year earlier. Large-scale manufacturing activity has already seen a record run of
eleven consecutive months decline up to May 2009. Further there has been no growth in credit
to the private sector. Given the various structural constraints faced by the country in economic
and security spheres recovery could be slow and sporadic.

While solutions for structural impediments develop in the backdrop, monetary policy will
maintain its oversight of inflation and its role in improving macroeconomic imbalances,
simultaneously supporting real economic activity. A 7.9 percentage point decline in CPI inflation
(YoY), from 19.1 percent in March ‘09 to 11.2 percent in July, is reassuring and validates the
direction of economic policy. The YoY non-food non-energy (NFNE) and 20-percent trimmed
measures of core inflation have also declined to 14.0 and 13.9 percent in July. In fact, the pace
of decline in inflation increased noticeably in Q4-FY09, compared to the previous quarter, and
continued through into the first month of FY10.

The external current account deficit contracted to $8.9 billion (5.3 percent of GDP) and SBP’s
foreign exchange reserve position strengthened to $9.1 billion by the end of June ‘09. As of 13th
August, ‘09 SBP’s foreign exchange reserves stand at $9.4 billion. With continuing global
recession and slowdown in domestic economic activity, both exports and imports have declined
by 5.9 and 10.5 percent in FYO9. Exports may improve slightly if global recovery sets in by the
beginning of 2010, as many anticipate. Similarly, imports could pick up also assuming domestic
economic recovery. Nevertheless, both are still expected to see a fall from fiscal year ‘09. Asa
result, the external current account deficit may come under 5.0 percent of GDP in FY10.
Provided projected foreign inflows are realized SBP’s foreign exchange reserves could improve
further to over $12 billion in this fiscal year.

The ability of the government to control its borrowings from the SBP in cumulative terms and to
raise their targeted amounts in T-bill auctions is another mark of success of the stabilization
program. Though there has been a slight uptick in the last two auctions, yields on government
paper of different tenors have broadly followed a falling trend despite the increased borrowing
requirements from banks. This reflects actual retrenchment of the fiscal deficit and
transparency in the conduct of borrowing operations from the banking system. At the same

Salim Raza underscores need for
effective regulation of world’s financial system

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has observed that effective regulation
is the preferred way forward for central banks responsible for safeguarding both monetary
and financial stability.

Delivering a keynote address on ‘Current Crisis and the Future of Financial Regulation’ at
the 59"" Annual General Meeting of the Institute of Bankers, Pakistan in Karachi today, Mr. Raza
said that in the context of recent experiences of the global economy, the way forward for the
financial sector is to maintain both the simplicity and transparency of product structures
and a gradual pace of implementation of financial liberalization to enable the financial
sector in meeting the needs of the real economy and to expand further in an efficient
manner.

Mr. Raza dwelt at length on some of the issues arising out of the current global crisis
and shared his perspective on various aspects of financial sector reforms, which are also
pertinent to Pakistan.

SBP Governor said that recent global crisis is unique in the sense that it was caused
by an unfettered parallel financial system which was driven by the excessive pace of
financial innovation and deregulation in advanced economies. It is to be noted that the
emphasis of the various working groups and committees is on fixing the financial
regulation framework in the leading developed economies. While fora like the G-20 now
also carry the representation of emerging economies such as China, Indonesia and India,
financial regulation in emerging and developing economies is still progressing, given that
the evolution of the financial sector and the associated regulatory framework is shaped by
the need to extend the outreach of financial services and increasing financial depth, rather
than putting aside the basic function of financial intermediation to engage in financial
engineering focused on profiteering.

“As we move forward to make the financial system in Pakistan less prone to crisis,
we would have to bear these various issues in mind,” he added.

Mr. Raza pointed out that the world’s financial system before the recent crisis was
ill-managed, irresponsible, highly concentrated and undercapitalized, ridden with conflicts
of interest and benefiting from implicit state guarantees. He said that as one contemplates
the lessons of the crisis, and the reasons for the prolonged period of financial instability,
the foremost thing that comes to mind is the role of central banks in safeguarding and
maintaining financial stability, in addition to their primary objective of ensuring price
stability.

SBP sets indicative target of Rs260 billion for
agricultural credit disbursement in FY10

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan today said that the central bank has set
an indicative target of Rs 260 billion for agricultural credit disbursement in the current fiscal year
(2009-10).

While chairing a meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held at the
State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this morning, Mr. Raza emphasized that in spite of structural shift
towards industrialization, agriculture sector is still the largest sector of the economy having deep
impact on socio-economic set-up. It is also the source of livelihood of at least 45 % of the total
employed labour force in the country. However, despite 22 % contribution in GDP, agriculture
sector has only 4.6% share in banks’ credit portfolio which is not an encouraging picture.

‘Adequate availability & access to institutional credit is essential for accelerating the pace of
agriculture development to ensure food security and poverty alleviation in the country’, Mr Raza added.

Mr Raza pointed out that high agri. NPLs, cumbersome & lengthy lending procedures, lack
of Agri. Finance Officers, innovative agri. finance products, banks’ management interest, farmers’
awareness about banks’ financial services, marketing & storage facilities, issues of passbook and
non-automation of land record; low yield, inordinate delays in payment of agri. products by mills,
ineffective implementation of government’s support price etc. are the major bottlenecks in agri.
financing.

SBP Governor emphasized upon the banks to revamp & re-structure their agri. lending
mechanism by adopting modern & innovative techniques to boost agricultural financing. In
addition, the government needs to devise the policy for introduction of corporate / cooperative
farming to enable the majority of (86% of the total farms) farmers of the country to have the
benefits of access to financial resources, new technology, quality inputs, marketing & storage
facilities etc. “Indeed, this would result in higher production and income to small farmers,” he
added.

He informed the meeting that despite unfavourable economic & market conditions in FY
09, banks were able to achieve more than 93 % of agri. credit disbursement target of Rs 250
billion. In absolute terms, banks disbursed Rs 233 billion with an increase of Rs 21.4 billion or 10%
over the disbursement of Rs 211.6 billion in FYO8. The major chunk of farm credit was availed by
the small farmers (subsistence holding) as their share in farm credit increased from 59% to 63%.

Mr Raza briefed the participants of the meeting about SBP initiatives and other various
activities in FYO9 including implementation of mandatory Crop Loan Insurance Scheme,
awareness programs/melas for farmers, training of more than 600 Agri. Field Officers of banks
under One Week Crash Training Program, enhancement of an average of 70% per acre credit limit
for major and minor crops from Rabi crop 2008-09, development of Benazir Zarai Card and Tractor

SBP Governor stresses the need for
development of capital markets

Syed Salim Raza, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed the need for the development of
capital markets, especially the bond and money markets in the country.

Addressing a luncheon meeting of the INSEAD Alumni Association of Pakistan at a local club in
Karachi, he said the risks caused by slowdown in globalization can effectively be overcome by promoting
national interests. ‘The Emerging Markets (EMs) will need to look at developing their own internal and
regional markets,’ Mr Raza added.

“Pakistan with others EMs could look at ways to galvanized intra-regional trade on a financial
next settlement basis to reduce money caught up in the chamber of trade — the Chiang Mai initiative is
an example of a significance start to promoting inter — regional trade liquidity,” the Governor added.

In view of the current global economic crisis, the SBP Governor said: “we have been less
affected than most of the EMs as our banks are squarely domestically based for asset and liabilities and
well-capitalized. Our exports were limited to 13% of GNP as against well over 30% for most of the larger
Asian economies while our imports will come down from 40 to 32% from both price and volume
effects.”

He observed that with inflation coming under control and a huge domestic market, we could
very usefully produce more for the domestic economy and take the opportunity to develop domestic
commerce and domestic brands.

The SBP Governor also spoke about the changes in economic ideology over the years and drew
on examples from Europe, Asia and the United States of America. He also spoke at length about Banking
spreads, SME development and remittances in response to questions raised by the alumni present at
the lunch.

It may be pointed out INSEAD is one of the world’s leading and largest business schools with
campuses in Europe (Fontainebleau) and Asia (Singapore) and two centres in the Middle East. Over
1,000 MBA and PhD candidates and over 9,500 executive education candidates attend its courses during
an academic year. Set up in 1957, it has today over 38,000 alumni in 150 countries around the world.
The Pakistan chapter was set up in 2008 by its Founder President Ms Sadia Khan.

impressed upon all the stakeholders including the federal / provincial governments and the
banking industry to make concerted efforts to strengthen the agricultural sector due to its
critical importance in the country’s economy.

Inaugurating the Second Inter-Provincial Agricultural Workshop organized by SBP
Banking Services Corporation in Lahore today, Mr. Kamran highlighted the initiatives taken the
SBP/SBP-BSC to ensure adequate flow of funds to the agriculture sector. He said that some of
the major initiatives include regular review of policy and regulatory environment, bringing all
the banks to serve the rural communities, arranging awareness & information dissemination
programs, building capacity of banks, conducting research and surveys to further explore the
dynamics of rural economy for the benefit of bankers, and establishing regional agri-finance
focus groups in all SBP-BSC offices across the country.

Speaking on the occasion, senior officials of SBP & SBP-BSC including Directors of
Development Finance Support Department and Agricultural Credit Department explained in
detail the status and distribution patterns of agriculture credit and the policies and operational
strategies being undertaken to facilitate flow of credit to the agriculture sector. They also
elaborated efforts of SBP & SBP-BSC efforts for creating awareness, building banks’ capacity,
information dissemination programs, and the implementation of One Window Operation under
Sindh Pilot Project. The cooperation of the Revenue department in the implementation of One
Window Operation was also appreciated.

Following decisions were taken at the workshop:

e SBP-BSC would further strengthen its awareness campaign and would organize Agri
Melas/seminars in collaboration with banks and relevant provincial government
departments in different towns;

e SBP would further enhance its capacity building efforts so that banks are able to serve
the rural community in a more professional manner;

e From this year onward regional targets for growth in Agricultural credit would be given
to banks to minimize regional disparities in flow of Agricultural credit;

e SBP would conduct more research studies and surveys of different regions to enhance
stakeholders understanding of the rural economies in various regions;

e The Revenue Departments would take further steps to ensure expeditious issuance of
passbooks to the farming community and for completion of the land record automation

SBP Deputy Governor urges
IBIs to increase their outreach

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan, today urged upon
the Islamic banking institutions to increase their outreach so as to enhance their
penetration and market share in the overall banking industry.

Speaking at the concluding session of a three-day workshop, jointly organized
by State Bank of Pakistan and the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) at SBP,
Karachi, Mr. Anwar said that despite the current global financial crisis, the Islamic
funds all over the world are ‘considerably liquid’ and added that this liquidity can be
effectively utilized to increase the penetration of Islamic banking not only in Pakistan
but elsewhere in the world.

SBP Deputy Governor highlighted the importance of having a comprehensive
framework of Risk Management, Corporate Governance and Supervisory Review
Process for the Islamic banking institutions. He said that the State Bank has played a
key role in providing an enabling environment and a level-playing field to the Islamic
banking industry through the provision of a comprehensive regulatory and
supervisory framework.

“Shariah-compliant mechanism introduced by SBP is the most comprehensive
available in the world,” he said and added that Pakistan is the only country which has
issued Guidelines on Islamic agriculture and microfinance. Similarly, SBP is the first
central bank to have initiated Shariah-compliant inspection mechanism, he added.

Mr. Anwar said that as a result of SBP’s initiatives the Islamic banking industry
in Pakistan has experienced robust growth in recent years. SBP’s recent achievement
of being ranked as the second best central bank at international level in promoting
Islamic banking is a reflection of this effort, he added.

He said the State Bank’s next five-year strategy for development of Islamic
banking industry envisages adopting various international prudential standards
developed by IFSB as an important pillar. “We have accordingly seized the
opportunity by capitalizing on IFSB's expertise through holding such workshops at
this juncture,” he said and added that adaptation of IFSB standards in the country
would enable Islamic banking institutions to perform on an equal footing with the
conventional banking industry.

Mr. Anwar appreciated role of the IFSB for preparing various Standards
wherein best international practices are developed through an exhaustive process
involving thorough research, discussions, public hearings, workshops/seminars etc.

The workshop was widely participated by the entire local industry wherein
IFSB speakers of international repute shared their wisdom and experiences with the
industry players. The workshop proved quite useful for enhancing the exposure of
the industry players.

Salim Raza urges corporate sector to introduce
more transparency in governance

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has urged upon the country’s
corporate sector to introduce more transparency in governance and decision making through
greater disclosure of financial and non-financial information to the stakeholders.

Speaking as a chief guest at the Best Corporate Reports Award Ceremony, jointly
organized by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP) and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) at a local hotel in Karachi today, Mr. Raza
said that there is still a need for fostering a change in the thinking of the corporate sector as the
old system of protectionism cannot work in this global challenging environment.

SBP Governor said that these awards would also assist country’s economy, which needs
sizeable investments in fixed capital. The Government’s efforts towards structural reforms and
recent geo-political developments in South Asian Region have once again put Pakistan in a
position to attract foreign investments and these awards would serve as a catalyst in
augmenting this progress, he added. Mr. Raza urged the professional accountants to work with
renewed zeal to enhance the prestige of the profession in the present global economic
slowdown.

Mr Raza opined that the Best Corporate Reports Award would certainly take us towards
greater transparency in disclosure of annual accounts and to strengthen good governance
practices in the corporate sector. These awards would also narrow the credibility gap, which
exists between various stakeholders and the management of the companies, he added. He
hoped that the level of reliance by all the stakeholders on the corporate reports and annual
accounts will significantly grow in the years to come.

SBP Governor said the cross border exposure of the corporate sector, the exposure in
new asset forms such as derivatives and accounting for off-balance sheet exposure are all
accompaniments of globalization and liberalization and they make new demands for progress in
the area of accounting and regulatory discipline. He said that in order to maximize dividend of
the global opportunity, the corporate sector has to improve the corporate governance even in
tightly held ownership companies.

Mr Raza observed that the modern accounting system underpins the continuity and
evolution of the joint stock company, which is the base of all developments in the modern
economy. He said that from the simple-double entry book keeping system, the profession of
accounting has evolved itself as a qualitative framework of methods and standards that ensure

State Bank to issue Monetary Policy Statement
on quarterly basis

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, disclosed today that the SBP Central
Board of Directors has decided that the central bank will issue monetary policy statement on
quarterly basis.

Unveiling the Monetary Policy Statement at a press conference held at State Bank, Mr.
Raza said that the next monetary policy statement will be issued by the end April 2009.

He said that extent of risks and vulnerabilities, which the economy had faced
during 2008, have moderated but we would need to remain watchful of the emerging
risks and challenges. He pointed out that factors such as the vulnerability of the external
sector due to high oil and other commodity prices; persistence of high imports and weak
prospects of foreign investment, have all moderated considerably owing to
improvements related to each area.

Mr. Raza said that progress has been made with inflation, over the last four
months, but it is very stubborn in the core inflation (i.e. non-food & non-energy). The
slow improvement in core inflation, while it has a structural element, is primarily owing
to the fact that non fuel and non food items, such as wages and rents and fares etc.
continue rising after the supply side shocks recede. This more entrenched trend is
because inflationary expectations remain; for the good reason that we have had 12
months of high inflation and several preceding years during which the potential for
inflation breaking out in a substantial way was being developed, he added.

He said that by the end of FYO9 there will be some reduction in both the fiscal
and external current account deficits relative to FY08. However, not only is the expected
magnitude of these deficits high but also there are risks of slippages. “This signifies that
the demand pressures have not completely dissipated despite a slowdown in economic
activity,” he said and added that the high expected average CPI inflation of 20 percent
for FY09 (significantly higher than the FYO9 target of 11 percent) and its persistence,
reflected by core inflation measures, clearly reflect the risk on this front.

“To mitigate the implications of these risks it is important to continue with the
current monetary policy stance,” he said and added, therefore, the SBP has decided to
keep the policy discount rate unchanged at 15 percent.

STATE BANK COMMITTED TO DEVELOP & DIVERSIFY FINANCIAL
SECTOR TO SPUR_ ECONOMIC GROWTH: SYED SALIM RAZA

The State Bank of Pakistan is committed to develop and diversify the financial sector in
order to enhance its role in supporting the country’s economic growth. This was stated by the
Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Syed Salim Raza while delivering his keynote address at a
Prize Award Ceremony of the Institute of Bankers, Pakistan in Karachi today.

‘Pakistan is currently standing at a juncture where long-term investment in
infrastructure is crucially needed to facilitate the process of economic growth’, the SBP
Governor added.

Stressing the need for the development of capital markets, Mr Raza said that developing
bond markets and enhancing the capacity of public- and private-sector borrowers to issue long-
dated local currency denominated debt securities is high on the country’s policy agenda.
Among other factors, the presence of the requisite investor base is crucial for the development
of both the primary and the secondary markets in debt securities, he said and added that the
regulatory environment should provide the right incentive framework to encourage both
individual and institutional investors to invest and trade in debt instruments.

The Governor opined that the banking sector, which enjoys virtual monopoly in
providing financing to all sectors of the economy, can play a contributing role in the
development of the debt market. He said the central bank has a crucial role in promoting
secondary market trading of debt securities by improving the effectiveness of monetary policy
implementation.

‘Development of the term structure of interest rates depends on regular issues in the
primary market, increased trading activity in the secondary market, and providing ease of entry
and exit to both the issuers and the investors. Regular auctions of Pakistan Investment Bonds
(PIBs) since May 2006 is a step in this direction’, Mr Raza observed.

Referring to sustainability of the banking sector, Mr Raza observed that banks in
Pakistan have been able to withstand the headwinds from the weakening macroeconomic
fundamentals since FYO7. ‘Now that the economy is poised for a remarkable turnaround, the
banking sector has an even greater role to play in supporting the real sector by meeting its
financing needs’, the SBP Governor added.

He said that Non Performing Loans (NPLs) of country’s banking system are expected to
stabilize with the improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals as the recent macroeconomic
pressures which eventually led to a slowdown in economic growth in FYO9, indicate that the

SBP Governor prods commercial banks to increase
credit disbursement to private sector

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has asked the commercial
banks to increase lending to the private sector in order to provide necessary stimulus to
the economy.

Presiding over a meeting of the Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) at
the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this afternoon, Mr. Raza urged the banks to take a
‘liberal view’ of the economy and play a role of a catalyst in the economic growth of the
country. “Liquidity in the banking system has never been as high as it is today,” he said
and added increased credit disbursement by banks will provide a stimulus to the
economy.

SBP Governor acknowledged that due to the current global and domestic
economic scenario the banks have become conservative and their terms of loans have
become stringent. But he said the growth in non-performing loans (NPLs) of banks has
slowed in the last quarter of 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9), which is a good omen.

He informed the meeting that overall private sector credit (PSC) after recording
the growth of 16.5 percent during FYO8 registered an increase of only 0.7 percent
during FYO9, mainly due to slowdown in economic activity coupled with the global
recession and rising NPLs etc.

Mr. Raza explained that PSC during July- December 2008 grew by 7 percent and
constituted 62 percent of total domestic credit. However, since December private
sector credit has witnessed a sharp fall, with an accumulative negative growth of 6
percent during Dec-June FYO9. “This behaviour is mainly due to slowing economic
activity, rising NPLs, partial settlement of power sector debt etc.,” he added.

Similarly, he pointed out that due to global recession country’s exports were
affected and on a cumulative basis (July-May FYO9) it declined by $202 million, thus
reducing the demand for credit. In addition to this, commodity prices reached a peak in
July 2008 and fell significantly thereafter, thus dampening the demand pressures in the
economy and hence the need for import related credit utilization, he added.

He disclosed that loans for working capital exhibited a decline of 7.6
percent during FYO9 mainly in the textile, manufacturing, commerce and trade sectors
while fixed investment financing increased by 26.4 percent mainly for investment in
manufacturing, electricity, gas & water and transport, storage & communication
sectors. On cumulative basis, credit for export finance has registered a disbursement of
Rs 15.4 billion as compared to Rs 19 billion last year, he added.

Mr. Raza pointed out that agricultural credit disbursement has shown a rising
trend as it increased by Rs21.4 billion or 10 percent during FYO9. Similarly,
infrastructure finance also grew by 43 percent mainly due to capital investment in
power generation and telecommunication sectors.

SBP measures helped create
Rs 360 billion liquidity for banking system: Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, said today that the central bank
has taken several measures to ease liquidity crunch in the banking system which have
resulted in the creation of an additional Rs 360 billion indirect and direct liquidity.

Presiding over a meeting of the Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) held at
State Bank, Mr Raza said that to ease tight liquidity conditions arising from extraordinary
outflows from the banking system during October 2008, the State Bank took a series of
measures including liquidity injection through OMOs, reduction in cash reserve requirement,
exemption of time deposits (i.e. deposits of above one-year tenor) from statutory liquidity
requirement, enhancement of list of eligible securities for SLR and provision of 100 percent
refinance to banks against Export Finance Scheme, he added.

“These measures helped pump in direct and indirect liquidity of around Rs 360 billion in
the banking system at present compared with just Rs 79 billion in September 2008,” he said.
Mr Raza said that sufficient liquidity is available in the banking system and urged upon the
commercial banks to increase lending to productive sectors of the economy which will help
the country to stage a quick economic recovery.

He noted with concern that private sector credit, after recording an average growth of
19 percent during FY06 to FY08, witnessed deceleration in the first seven months of FY09
(July 08 to January 09) mainly due to slowdown in the economic activity coupled with global
recession. He said overall credit disbursement to the private sector expanded by Rs 158.4
billion during July 2008 to January 2009 and recorded a growth of 5.5 percent compared to
Rs 260.3 billion or 10.5 percent last year. On annualized basis, however, growth is 11.2
percent, which is lower than 17 percent last year, he added. During FYO9, private sector
credit expanded substantially till October 2008 as private sector availed credit of Rs 125.6
billion during the period 1st July-1st November 2008 compared to Rs 60.5 billion in the same
period last year. Thereafter, the credit- take-off started to decelerate and it increased by
only Rs 32.8 billion during 1°* November 2008 — 31° January 2009 as compared with Rs 199.8
billion in corresponding period last year.

SBP Governor told the participants that weak demand, high mark-up rates, rising non-
performing loans and past liquidity constraints are some of the important factors behind
decelearation in private sector credit disbursement.

He informed the meeting that credit disbursement to the agriculture sector through
banking system in first half of FYO9 remained at Rs 99.4 billion, up 10 percent over the
disbursement of Rs 90.3 billion in the same period last year, against an annual target of
Rs 250 billion.

Salim Raza announces cut in key policy rate to 13%,
unveils monetary management initiatives

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan today announced reduction in central
bank’s key policy rate by 100 basis points to 13 percent which will be effective from August
17"", 2009.

Unveiling the July-September 2009 Monetary Policy Statement at a press conference at
SBP, Karachi this afternoon, Mr. Raza announced SBP’s initiatives in the area of monetary
management. He said that SBP is introducing a corridor for the money market overnight repo
rate, effective August 17"", 2009. While the SBP policy rate will serve as a ‘ceiling’, the repo rate
on the new overnight deposit facility, 300 bps below the SBP policy rate, will provide a binding
‘floor,’ he added.

“The introduction of this framework will improve liquidity management, enhance
effectiveness of market signaling, and foster stability and transparency in the money market
operations,” he said and added it will also improve transmission of monetary policy signals,
strengthening its role in fostering price stability.

SBP Governor also announced that the frequency of monetary policy decisions will be
increased from four to six times a year. Henceforth, monetary policy decisions will be
announced in the last week of September, November, January, March, May, and July. The
January and July policy announcements will be accompanied with a detailed monetary policy
statement and a press conference, he said and added that on remaining four occasions the
monetary policy decisions will be communicated through a brief press release only. “High
frequency of MPS announcement will provide greater clarity in how changing economic
conditions are being addressed,” he emphasized.

Mr. Raza said an independent monetary policy committee (MPC) is being constituted
that will have external experts as members in addition to SBP and SBP Board representatives.
The inclusion of external members is designed to ensure that SBP benefits from expertise and
independent views concerning monetary policy, he said and added: “This step will bring us in
link with best international practices by enhancing the transparency and credibility of monetary
policy formulation process.” Mr. Raza extensively briefed about current macroeconomic
situation. “We have, in a difficult year, seen improvement in key macroeconomic indicators
following continued implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program,” he said and
added CPI inflation continues to fall, government borrowing from the central bank remains
within quarterly limits, and SBP’s foreign exchange reserves have increased.

“These positives, in turn, reflect contraction in aggregate demand, much-needed fiscal
consolidation, and an improved balance of payments position,” SBP Governor said and
emphasized that consistent with the gradual strengthening of macro fundamentals, the inter-
bank money market is functioning smoothly, the foreign exchange market has been stable
within a tight range, and deposit growth in the banking system is picking up. The text of SBP
Governor press statement is attached.

Banks resilient enough to cope challenges
under strong oversight: SBP Report

Pakistan’s banking system effectively coped with several challenges emanated
from economic slowdown, both at home and abroad, due to strong resilience built over
the years and effective regulatory and supervisory regime.

According to State Bank of Pakistan’s Quarterly Performance Review of the
Banking System for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 released today, asset base of
the banking system grew 2.6 percent over the quarter to reach Rs 5,653 billion, well
supplemented by 3.6 percent and 7 percent growth in deposit and shareholders’ equity,
respectively. The liquidity profile of the banking system remained constrained for most
part of the quarter. However, post quarter statistics indicate significant easing out in
liquidity profile because of the gradual increase in deposits and reduction in banks’
advances.

The Report pointed out that in line with deterioration in macroeconomic
indicators, the credit risk remained heightened during the quarter. Non-performing
Loans (NPLs) of the banking system increased to Rs 313 billion (Rs 278 billion in Sep-08)
giving infection ratio of 9.1 percent and net infection ratio of 2.5 percent, it said.
However, satisfactory earnings enabled the system to cover these loan losses. NPLs are
covered by the loan loss provisions to the extent of 75 percent, but due to these
increased loan provisions in absolute amounts, earnings of the banking system came
under pressure and remained lower than last couple of years’ levels — ROA of 1.2
percent for the year 2008 versus 1.5 percent for 2007 and 2.0 percent for 2006.

It said overall solvency position of the banking system registered an
improvement. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) under Basel-Il framework, which also
accounts for the operational risk charge, improved to 12.2 percent (12.6 percent for
commercial banks) due to fresh injection of equity and satisfactory earnings. The CAR
improved to 13 percent jointly for banks and Development Finance Institutions (DFls), it
added.

“Banking system shows strong resilience to unusual shocks in major risk factors.
This strength of the banking system largely came from the prudent regulatory and
supervisory regime, strengthening of risk management and governance standards in
banks as well as the improved solvency position,” the Report emphasized.

“Going forward, due to constrained economic environment both at home and
globally, the credit risk, earnings, and growth rates of the banking system are likely to
remain under some strain in coming quarters,” the Report anticipated.

The detailed Report can be accessed at SBP’s website http://www.sbp.org.pk.

Banking industry has great potential
for further investment: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan said today that Pakistan’s
banking system has great potential for further investment.

Speaking at a ceremony held in Karachi for the launching of Silkbank
Limited, formerly Saudi Pak Commercial Bank Ltd., Mr Raza said the performance
of country’s financial sector, which is largely dominated by banks, has been
outstanding throughout the current economic situation.

He said the banking sector has over the years nurtured itself in a way that it
is able to withstand some of the shocks it has faced in the last 18 months or so.
‘The banking system is on strong footing and has long term potential, a feature
which has served to attract a substantial amount of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) in the sector, with established global financial institutions now active
participants in the domestic financial sector,’ he said and added that the banking
industry is well-governed and has witnessed outstanding financial performance

significant enhancement of capital and risk-weighted capital adequacy,’ he said
and added that stringent loan provisioning requirement has built sufficient

Remittances rise 31.78% to record

$780.53 million in August 2009

Pakistani workers remitted a record amount of $780.53 million in August, 2009 as
against $592.30 million in the same month of the last fiscal year (August 2008), showing
a jump of $188.23 million or 31.78%. The amount of $780.53 million includes $0.52
million received through encashment and profit earned on Foreign Exchange Bearer
Certificates (FEBCs) and Foreign Currency Bearer Certificates (FCBCs).

This is the second consecutive record amount remitted in a single month during
the current 2009-10 fiscal year (FY10). The previous highest amount remitted in a single
month by Pakistani workers was recorded in July, 2009, when an amount of $744.85
million was received in the country.

It may be pointed out that the State Bank, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Overseas Pakistanis had undertaken a joint initiative called ‘Pakistan Remittance
Initiative (PRI)’ recently with a view to facilitating the flow of remittances through
formal channels. This initiative has started to materialize and remittances through
formal channels are showing considerable growth.

During the first two months (July-August) of FY10, an amount of $1.525 billion
was sent home by overseas Pakistanis, showing an impressive 25 percent rise when
compared with $1.219 billion received in the same period last year. The amount of
$1.525 billion includes $0.66 million received through encashment and profit earned on
FEBCs and FCBCs. The monthly average remittances for the period July-August of FY10
comes out to $762.69 million as compared to $609.76 million during the same
corresponding period of the last fiscal year, registering an increase of 25 percent.

The inflow of remittances in the July-August, 2009 period from UAE, USA, Saudi
Arabia, GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman), UK and EU
countries amounted to $324.17 million, $316.94 million, $296.44 million, $211.48

$319.84 million, $264.64 million, $206.70 million, $74.82 million and $32.70 million
respectively in the July-August, 2008 period. Remittances received from Norway,
Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan and other countries during the first two months of
FY10 amounted to $175.08 million as against $119.30 million in the same period last
year.

current 2008-09 fiscal year (FYO9) which is higher by Rs 50 billion or 25% than last
fiscal year’s target of Rs 200 billion and Rs 38 billion or 18% higher than the actual

PRI-PIA alliance to help boost remittance inflows
through banking channels: Shaukat Tarin

Mr. Shaukat Tarin, the Federal Minister for Finance, has expressed the hope that strategic
alliance between Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would
contribute towards the enhancement of remittance flows through official channels and help the
Government to achieve the goal of formalizing the remittance market in the country.

Addressing a MoU signing ceremony between PRI and PIA held at State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi
today, Mr. Tarin urged the overseas Pakistanis to make sure that they are transferring their hard-earned
income through official channels into Pakistan. He said that he was confident that PRI would usher in a
new era in the realm of worker’s remittances and reach the ultimate destination of highest efficiency
and maximum satisfaction levels. “The performance of PRI has been commendable since its inception
and | am confident that they would continue to work with same commitment and dedication to achieve
the desired objectives,” he added.

Mr. Tarin said that the trend of remittances received in last five months of this fiscal year shows
an increase of around 30 percent over the similar period in the last fiscal year. However, he pointed out
that the success of PRI does not lie in month-to-month numbers, rather its objective is to lay the
foundation of a permanent structure whereby there would be: end-to-end efficient systems, maximum
satisfaction of remitter & beneficiary, highest degree of commitment of the financial sector, and the
inclusion of such ingredients into the policy framework for PRI whereby the consistent political will
should become a norm rather than an exception.

He said that there are a number of cyclical and environmental factors which affect the flow of
remittances in either way. Therefore, the performance of PRI cannot be judged from the month-to-
month numbers, at least in the short term, he said and added that their performance, however, will be
evaluated, amongst others, by the remittance flows in to the country in a given fiscal year.

Mr. Tarin highlighted the role of financial sector in the national cause of formalizing remittance
market in Pakistan and said that it is quite satisfactory to note that the banks have started to improve
their infrastructure and related systems with a view to offering better remittance services. He warned
the banking system about the symptoms of complacency. He advised the financial sector that they
should thoroughly review their existing customer base and immediately terminate the banking
relationship with those who are suspicious to be associated with illegal foreign exchange business. He
also applauded the role of law enforcement agencies, especially the FIA in taking stern actions against
illegal foreign exchange operators which has played a vital role in the rising trend of remittances in
Pakistan. “Accordingly, we have mutually decided to give monetary reward to FIA officials associated
with the law enforcement actions against illegal foreign exchange operators,” he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Farooq Sattar, the Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis, said
that it gives him immense pleasure to state that PRI is moving ahead with the plans and achieving the

Banks urged to adopt effective tools
for galvanizing home remittances

Dr Farooq Sattar, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis, today urged upon
commercial banks and other stakeholders to adopt various cost-effective and technologically
advanced delivery channels that would help achieve two-fold increase in the quantum of
home remittances within a year.

During a meeting, which was jointly chaired by Dr Sattar and Syed Salim Raza, Governor,
State Bank of Pakistan, held at SBP Karachi, the Minister for Overseas Pakistanis said effective
delivery channels would help in incremental growth of home remittances. “It may be an
ambitious target but not an impossible one,” Dr Sattar added. He hoped that every
stakeholder will work in a coordinated manner to achieve the goal.

The meeting discussed in detail issues related to transmission of funds from overseas
Pakistanis to their families back home. Both Mr Raza and Dr Sattar underscored the need to
facilitate remitters so they could be encouraged to use official channels for transmission of
remittances as movement of funds through informal channels represents both a loss of
revenue and a welfare loss for remitters who are forced to send money home via
undocumented channels.

Mr Raza said that the State Bank would take the initiative in consultation with the
Ministry for Overseas Pakistani and other stakeholders in developing a mechanism to enhance
flow of inward remittances and for better investment prospects. He said that special emphasis
will be given to reduction in cost of sending remittances and delivery time involved, which are
some of the major hurdles in mobilizing remittances through formal channels.

The participants of the meeting were given a brief presentation by the State Bank on
recent international efforts and practices being followed by banks in various developing
countries to facilitate the flow of remittances. Heads of various commercial banks and other
stakeholder apprised the meeting about their initiatives and the products they are offering to
their customers.

The meeting was attended, among others, by heads of commercial banks,
representatives from NADRA, Central Directorate of National Savings and other stakeholders,
besides senior officials of the State Bank and Ministry for Overseas Pakistanis.

Salim Raza hopes country’s exports
will improve in near future

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan today said that the country’s exports
are likely to improve in the near future in view of improved global economic situation next
year coupled with measures taken by the Federal Government and the central bank for the
promotion of exports.

Speaking at an International Conference on ‘Financial Meltdown — Crisis of Governance’
organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) in Karachi, Mr. Raza
highlighted the steps taken by the Government and the State Bank for the promotion of
exports. He said that SBP has taken a number of measures to support country’s exports which
include one year extension in mark-up subsidy for spinning sector, provision of 100 percent
financing to banks against export finance provided to exporters, provision of one year
moratorium on loans availed under the Long Term Financing Facility, extension in the period of
refinancing under Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and provision of EFS to some categories of
cotton fabrics and provision of LTFF to various spinning sectors and removal of margin
requirement on imports.

SBP Governor said that as Pakistan is currently under an IMF program, the Government
has limited scope to provide relief to the exporters. Nevertheless, he added, the Government
has announced a number of measures in the Federal Budget and the recently announced Trade
and Textile policy to support exporters. These measures include proposal for an establishment
of a Rs 40 billion Export Development Fund, proposal for establishment of a Reinsurance or
Credit Guarantees Fund of Rs. 10 billion, proposal for the establishment of Capital Fund of Rs 10
billion, compensating exporters of cement, light engineering, leather garments and furniture for
the additional inland freight cost, establishing a technology, skills and management and up
gradation fund of Rs 3.0 billion and creation of a Rs 2.5 billion fund for the up gradation of light
engineering export production facilities.

Mr. Raza said that the Federal Government has also announced a separate set of
incentives for the textiles sector, which include creation of a Technology Up gradation Fund
(TUF) and Rs1.6 billion have been allocated in FY10, which will be used to finance 50% of the
markup cost for capital intensive projects whereas 20% of the capital cost will be paid as a grant
for smaller setups.

SBP Revises Paid-up Capital Requirements for Banks

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to revise downward the minimum paid-up capital
(free of losses) requirements (MCR) for banks. This decision has been taken in view of the
general global slowdown in growth and capital accumulation by financial institutions and
representations from shareholders.

Now the banks are required to raise their minimum paid up capital (free of losses) to Rs 10
billion by December 31, 2013 instead of earlier set limit of Rs 23 billion, says BSD Circular No.7
of 15"" April, 2009.

According to the circular the banks will now be required to raise their minimum paid-up
capital (free of losses) to Rs 6 billion by December 31, 2009, Rs 7 billion by December 31, 2010,
Rs 8 billion by December 31, 2011, Rs 9 billion by December 31, 2012 and Rs 10 billion by
December 31, 2013.

It may be recalled here that according to the instructions issued earlier (BSD Circular
No.19 dated the 5"" September, 2008), the banks were required to raise their MCR to Rs 10
billion by December 31, 2010, Rs 15 billion by December 31, 2011, Rs 19 billion by December
31, 2012 and Rs 23 billion by December 31, 2013.

BSD Circular No.7 further says that while capital adequacy standards will continue as
previously and all banks/DFls shall be required to increase CAR to 10% w.e.f. December 31,
2009 irrespective of their CAMELS-S rating, till further instructions.

Branches of foreign banks (FBs) operating in Pakistan are also required to raise their
assigned capital (net of losses) to Rs. 10 billion within the above prescribed timelines. However,
those foreign banks whose Head Offices hold Paid up capital (free of losses) of at least
equivalent to USS 300 million and have a CAR of at least 8% or minimum prescribed by their
home regulator, whichever is higher, will be allowed with prior approval of the State Bank to
maintain assigned capital as under:

Salim Raza stresses need for reforms to promote
entrepreneurial culture

Highlighting the importance of entrepreneurship, the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Syed
Salim Raza has stressed the need for reforms to foster an entrepreneurial culture.

Addressing a conference on ‘Entrepreneurship 2009’, which was organized by Memon
Professional Forum at a local hotel in Karachi today, Mr. Raza said that there is ample research
available globally, which links entrepreneurship, innovation and growth to encourage policy makers to
favour policies fostering reforms. “In an environment of innovative entrepreneurship and dynamic
markets, businesses can grow rapidly, ensuring that employment grows and opportunity expands,” he
said and added that in under-developed countries like Pakistan, there is an added bonus that such an
environment is also the most poor-friendly and conducive to social mobility.

SBP Governor raised the question that what are the elements of such an enabling
environment? He outlined that in his opinion some important elements are: a level playing field for all
entrants, with minimal regulation that is not too onerous; free and flexible markets that allow new
businesses to start and equally important for businesses to die; rule of law, including the protection of
property rights (particularly intellectual property rights); a dynamic financial market that allows
entrepreneurs access to capital and a quality educational system. He said that the World Bank 2009
survey of cost-of-doing-business in 181 countries clearly stresses the need for continued reforms in
these areas in Pakistan.

Mr. Raza dwelt upon meaning of entrepreneurship and said that it has a range of meanings.
On the one hand it encompasses innovative ideas and implementations that change the way business
is conducted in a market. On the other extreme, the term applies equally well to the lowly street
vendor, who seeks to set up a small stall of his own to provide a living to his family, funded perhaps by
micro-savings or micro credit, and hoping to succeed by dint of sheer hard work and the ability to
satisfy a small market niche, the SBP Governor added.

He said that while seemingly very different, in essence, both the definitions of
entrepreneurship encompass some common elements: (1) The ability to envision an unmet market
niche or innovation that can change the market; (2) the willingness to invest their time, money, and
effort seeking to bring that vision to life and (3) the willingness to assume all the resulting risks and
rewards. “It is thus probably no coincidence that the most innovation occurs in countries that
encourage the entrepreneurs the most,” he added.

SBP Governor hoped that this conference will play a very important role in raising awareness of

the importance of entrepreneurship.

SBP to facilitate establishment of Infrastructure Development
Bank, Mortgage Refinance Company: Salim Raza

Syed Salim Raza, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that the central bank is
working on the establishment of Infrastructure Development Bank and Mortgage
Refinance Company under Public-Private Partnership for the growth and development
of infrastructure and housing sector in the country.

Presiding over a meeting of Private Sector Credit Advisory Council (PSCAC) held at
State Bank today, Mr. Raza said that the State Bank has taken several initiatives for
enhancing credit disbursement to underserved segments i.e. agriculture, SME,
microfinance, housing and infrastructure.

“State Bank is playing its due role to stimulate private sector credit off-take and
to turnaround economic slowdown,” he said. He, however, stressed upon the private
sector to come forward with well thought out project plans so that banks are able to
finance them. “I strongly believe that growth stimulus has to come from agriculture and
SME sectors,” he added.

Talking about overall scenario of private sector credit disbursement, Mr. Raza
noted that decelerating trend of credit disbursement has been arrested and lately
disbursement has picked up. He pointed out that overall decline in credit disbursement
was limited to Rs 28 billion as of July-November 7, 2009 compared with a decline of Rs
81 billion till July-September 2009. He said that the share of private sector credit in total
credit has declined from 61% as at end Dec 2008 to 53.3% by 7th November 2009 due to
continuous contraction in PSC and enhanced flow of credit to government sector & PSEs
during the last three quarters.

Referring to reasons behind low credit off-take, Mr. Raza said that prolonged
power shortages and poor security situation had an adverse impact on industrial
production which grew by a mere 0.2% in July-August 2009. Similarly, decline in exports
exhibited some impact of global recession particularly in major export destination like
the USA and the European Union which have witnessed one of their worst economic
slowdown during last two quarters of 2008 and in the first three quarters of 2009.

Yaseen Anwar asks commercial banks
to promote financial inclusion

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan has urged the
commercial banks to focus on improving access to finance and promote financial inclusion
without compromising on the safety and soundness of the overall banking system.

Speaking at the 3° International Mobile Commerce Conference in Pakistan at a
local hotel in Karachi today, he said that as a regulator, the State Bank will always facilitate
the banking sector by providing various options to conduct smoothly its operation of
financial intermediation.

He said the mobile phone banking that comprises the larger part of branchless
banking can be implemented by using one-to-one (one bank having joint venture/agency
agreement with one telco/non-bank), one-to-many (one bank with many telcos) business
arrangements and many-to-many (many banks with many telcos). “We have given banks
the liberty to select a model most suitable for its operational capabilities as well as business
considerations,” he added.

Mr. Anwar said the State Bank is also considering the non-bank led/Telco led
model of branchless banking. This of course adds a totally new dimension to regulation that
extends beyond the direct supervisory role of SBP, he said and added: ‘we may need to
establish, as in some countries, a National Payments Council that will include other
stakeholders to regulate this rapidly expanding business sector’.

SBP Deputy Governor said that SBP has issued guidelines for branchless banking
as part of a broader strategy to create an enabling regulatory environment with the
objectives of promoting financial inclusion.

Mr. Anwar said that branchless banking is a significantly cheaper alternative to
conventional branch-based banking as it allows banks to offer financial services outside
traditional bank premises. “One inherent power of branchless banking is that it can be used
to substantially increase the financial services outreach to the un-banked communities and
in a broader perspective provides ways and means in the promotion of financial inclusion
in the country,” he added.

He said that Pakistan’s financial sector has witnessed the transformation from a
paper based nationalized era to a more technology based dynamic sector. As far as e-
banking in Pakistan is concerned; the statistics are gradually showing encouraging trends,
he said and added that as of December 2009, the number of real time online branches has
reached 6700. “We have now around 4400 ATMs and the quantity of cards
(debit/credit/ATM) in circulation has reached 10 million,” he said and added that the

Islamic banking industry needs to focus on
developing innovative products: Dr. Zamir Iqbal

Dr. Zamir Iqbal, a renowned scholar on Islamic Finance, has stressed upon
the need for developing mechanism to enhance the liquidity and innovative
Islamic financial products in order to cater to the growing demands of Islamic
finance in the world.

Delivering a Talk on ‘What Needs to be Done for Islamic Finance to
Succeed’ at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today, Dr. Iqbal observed that
current business model of the Islamic banking industry needs to be reviewed to
cater to the demand for more sophisticated products, which is likely to grow
rapidly.

He said that it would be better for the Islamic banking industry to innovate
rather than replicate the conventional banking products and noted that no or
limited collective efforts have been made so far to develop such products.

Highlighting some factors for sustainable growth of Islamic Finance, Dr.
Iqbal emphasised upon the need for consolidation of Islamic banking; expanding
the scope, services and products, strengthening the risk management systems
and reducing reliance on commodity/fixed income-like products.

Referring to legal and regulatory issues, Dr. Iqbal asserted that there is a
need to improve corporate and Shariah governance, and supervision &
monitoring systems. He also stressed upon the need to promote risk-sharing
through participatory instruments like Musharaka and Mudaraba.

Dr. Iqbal said that over the years Islamic Finance has grown into a global
phenomenon and Islamic Finance market in the world is estimated at $1 trillion.
“Islamic Finance is just not a phenomenon restricted to only Muslim countries,”

Yaseen Anwar prods Islamic banks to diversify
products, capitalize on inherent strengths

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Acting Governor State Bank of Pakistan said today the Islamic Financial
System has the potential to provide better banking and financial services than the conventional
system provided it capitalizes on its own inherent strengths and avoids following the conventional
system.

Addressing the inaugural session of Islamic Financial News Roadshow on Islamic Banking held
at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi, Mr. Anwar said the current Islamic banking paradigm, both in
Pakistan and elsewhere, is based on replication of conventional banking products. “While the
replication of conventional products to make them Shariah compliant does pass the Shariah
permissibility test, it is insufficient to achieve the larger objectives of Islamic financial system,
particularly the broad-based and equitable distribution of economic gains,” he added.

SBP Acting Governor asserted that total reliance of Islamic banks on debt-based fixed income
products and minimizing the risks to almost close to those of the conventional system is not only
blurring the distinction between Islamic and conventional finance but also making Islamic banks
relatively less efficient than their conventional counterparts. “Thus to sustain the growth momentum,
the industry will have to diversify its products mix by focusing on areas where it has comparative
advantage rather than blindly following the conventional system,” he observed.

While giving an example of Pakistan, Mr. Anwar said that 67% of Islamic banks’ financing in the
country is concentrated in the corporate sector through Murabaha, ljarah, and Diminishing
Musharaka. With most of the corporates having banking relationships with conventional banks, the
Islamic banks have to offer significant price discounts to attract the corporate clients, he said and
added that while this improves the quality of their financing portfolio, it reduces their profit margins
and inhibits their ability to offer better returns to the depositors, he emphasized. It also restricts the
access to finance to the well established businesses and corporates and leaves the SMEs and startup
businesses financially excluded. “This is contrary to the natural business model of Islamic finance,
which promotes risk and reward sharing and encourages financing to promising startups that is
critically important for promoting entrepreneurial culture,” he added.

SBP Acting Governor also pointed out that the present scope of Islamic banks’ business model
is confined to that of conventional banks which generally caters to the short term financing needs of
the real economy through interest bearing instruments/facilities. While this scope is in line with the
business model and deposit streams of conventional banks, it is not sufficient for Islamic banks which
were originally conceived for catering to the genuine financing needs of the real economy through
risk and reward sharing instruments, he added.

“As | said earlier, the Islamic banks with this narrow scope will find it difficult to compete with
the conventional banks, which are giants when compared with Islamic banks and are highly efficient

State Bank raises Policy Rate by 50 bps
to 14 percent from Nov. 30""

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to raise its Policy Rate by 50 basis points to 14
percent with effect from November 30, 2010. This decision was taken at a meeting of the
Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan held under the Chairmanship of
Governor SBP, Mr. Shahid H. Kardar in Lahore today.

“SBP’s efforts to counterbalance the rapid expansion in reserve money and arrest the
rising inflation expectations would require an increase in the policy rate,” the State Bank said in
its Monetary Policy Decision while explaining the rationale behind the increase in policy rate.

It said that the inflation is rising and showing persistence because of relentless
government borrowing from the SBP. The rising Net Domestic Assets (NDA) to Net Foreign
Assets (NFA) ratio of SBP balance sheet and its strong association with CPI inflation also suggest
that the inflation is likely to persist at double digit levels during much of FY11 and possibly in
FY12.

A principled decision has also been taken by the Central Board to strictly implement the
revised limits on borrowings of the provinces from the SBP, even if it involves stopping payments to
the provincial governments, ’SBP believes that the entire responsibility of tackling macroeconomic
problems has been unfairly placed on monetary policy only. SBP also understands that the burden of
this monetary tightening is being borne largely by the private sector, as it gets crowded out by the
excesses of government borrowing for budgetary purposes and commodity operations, with all its
adverse implications for sustainable economic growth’ according to Monetary Policy Decision.

Following is the complete text of Monetary Policy Decision:

“The economy’s ability to achieve sustainable recovery remains constrained owing to slow
progress in the prevailing security and economic conditions. The key economic variables impeding
stabilization and thereby growth are high and persistent inflation, continuing fiscal slippages and
unresolved power sector issues. Whereas adjustments in administered prices of fuel and energy and
the post-flood disruption in the supply chain of food items have contributed to the recent upsurge in
inflation, the high level of government borrowing from the SBP is diluting the effectiveness of
monetary policy in containing excessive monetary expansion and thus inflation. The need for such
borrowing is largely emanating from a seemingly difficult fiscal predicament. While rising security
and flood-related expenditures and continued power sector subsidies are one aspect of the problem,
a narrow tax base and a declining tax to GDP ratio are bigger issues magnifying the fiscal challenges.
The cost to the economy is being paid through erosion in the purchasing power of the rupee, growing
total debt, and discouragement of productive private sector activity.

State Bank’s Policy Rate to Remain unchanged at 12.5 percent

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to keep its Policy Rate unchanged at 12.5 Percent. This decision was
taken at a meeting of the Central Board of directors of the State Bank of Pakistan held under the Chairmanship
of SBP Deputy Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Lahore today.

Following is the complete text of Monetary Policy Decision.

Building on initial gains in macroeconomic stability the economy is looking to further its traction for
sustainable recovery. Inflationary pressures have dampened but continue to persist, mainly due to alignment of
energy sector prices with market factors. Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) has consistently grown since October
2009 after contraction for almost 20 months but remains fragile. Reduction in the external current account
deficit has allowed SBP to rebuild foreign exchange reserves, despite shortfalls in external financial flows.
However, uncertainty has increased in some areas, particularly the fiscal sector, with implications for the rest of
the economy, including monetary policy.

Although CPI inflation (YoY) has come down to 13.0 percent in February 2010, it is high and exhibits
persistence. After a low of 8.9 percent in October 2009, inflation slipped back largely due to increases in
electricity tariffs, adjustments in the prices of domestic petroleum products, and administered prices of
commodities like wheat. To which extent these factors will influence other prices in the economy and
expectations of inflation in the coming months remain difficult to assess. Nonetheless, SBP expects the average
CPI inflation for FY10 to remain close to 12 percent.

Despite presence of high inflation, crippling electricity shortages, and challenging security conditions,
domestic economic activity has picked up in recent months. A cumulative growth of 2.4 percent during the first
seven months of FY10 in the Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) is encouraging. Sustainability of this trend in LSM
and overall economic growth would depend on improvements in the availability of electricity and security
situation. In addition, this would need supportive growth in private sector credit, which in turn depends on a
reduction in the scale of government and public sector’s reliance on bank borrowings.

The balance of payments position has improved considerably. The external current account deficit has
come down to $2.6 billion during July — February, FY10 compared to $8 billion in the same period last year. This
has allowed SBP to accumulate foreign exchange reserves, $11.1 billion as on 26th March 2010, and has
facilitated stability in the foreign exchange market. However, other developments in the external sector, such as
Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and workers’ remittances, need to be monitored closely, especially when
prospects of foreign official flows remain unclear.

The key source of uncertainty, however, lies in the weak fiscal position. Burdened by significant security
related expenditures and shortfalls in revenues, keeping the fiscal deficit for FY10 within target would be
challenging. Partial phasing out of subsidies and reduction in development expenditures have helped in
containing expenditures but has lead to surge in domestic prices and is hurting crucial public sector investment.
Similarly, increased Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) receipts, due to higher oil imports, have cushioned the
lower tax revenues to some extent but have contributed towards inertia in domestic inflation. During the
remaining months of FY10, uncertainty regarding non-tax revenues on account of foreign reimbursements and
extent of remaining power sector subsidies adds to fiscal complications.

SBP developing mechanism for IBIs to
manage surplus liquidity: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the central
bank is working actively with the stakeholders to develop Shariah-compliant instruments which
will provide some flexible and convenient mechanism for managing the surplus liquidity in the
Islamic banking industry.

Delivering a welcome note at a talk by Dr. Zamir Iqbal, a renowned scholar on Islamic
Finance, on ‘What Needs to be Done for Islamic Finance to Succeed’ at State Bank of Pakistan,
Karachi today, Mr. Anwar said that Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) in the country are facing
the issue of short-term liquidity management. “This not only adversely impacts the profitability
of IBIs but also inhibits aggressive deposit mobilization by them,” he added.

However, he said with the development of new Shariah-compliant instruments, this
problem will be resolved and they will also be instrumental in the development of Islamic
interbank money market besides providing a platform for developing benchmark for pricing of
Islamic finance products.

Talking about some of the challenges being faced by IBls, Mr. Anwar said that the gross
absence of participatory modes of financing is amongst the key challenges faced by the industry
as presently the industry has an exclusive and overwhelming focus on debt/trade based modes
of Murabaha and ljarah. He said although these modes minimize the Islamic banks’ risk to
almost equivalent to that of conventional banks, they are not sufficient to achieve the socio-
economic objectives of Islamic finance. The participatory modes like Musharka and Mudaraba,
on the other hand, not only ensure risks sharing between the banks and entrepreneurs but also
promote equitable distribution of rewards amongst the entrepreneurs and investors (the IBls
and their depositors), he added.

SBP Acting Governor, however, pointed out that there are inherent risks that include
moral hazards, adverse selection, none or limited record keeping, etc. that discourage IBls to
build Islamic finance portfolios based on participatory modes. “SBP has plans to facilitate and
catalyze gradual movement of the industry towards build-up of PLS based financing portfolio
and | hope the discussion today would explore possible strategies for moving towards

Banks’ Lending to private sector shows 4% broad-based
growth during Oct-Dec. quarter: State Bank Report

Commercial banks’ lending to private sector during the October-December
quarter of 2009-10 fiscal year (FY10) increased by 4.16% and unlike previous
quarters the growth in credit off-take was widely shared by different leading
sectors of the economy, according to State Bank of Pakistan’s Quarterly
Performance Review report of the Banking System.

According to the report which was released today, the growth in loans was
well supported by expansion in deposit base that increased by 6.8 percent, while
due to 10% growth in investments (62.3% Year-on-Year), the asset base of the
system increased by 6.9 percent (16 % Y-o-Y), it added.

The report highlighted that equity injections and accumulation of year-to-
date profits raised the equity base of the banking system. The risk-based Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the system due to stronger increase in Risk Weighted
Asset slightly decreased to 14.1% (14.3% in Sep-09); the stress test results showed
that capital base of the system is strong enough to withstand unusual shocks in
major risk factors.

State Bank’s report pointed that the slowdown in loan infection rate
preserved the banks’ earnings from significant dint, which has been the hallmark
of last few quarters. Though more than proportionate growth in net-markup and
non-mark up incomes augmented earnings, faster accumulation of operating
expenses moderated the Return on Assets (ROA). The indicator, with slight
contraction, remained almost stable at the last quarter’s level but significantly
higher than last year’s results, it added.

“The overall earnings capacity of the system has remained fair; however,
the earnings are largely concentrated in large and medium-sized banks, as most of
the small-sized banks’ bottom lines were either low or in red,” it said and added
that the pre-tax Return on Assets remained 1.5 percent (1.2 percent for CY- 08).

Real GDP growth likely to be around annual
target of 3.3%: SBP First Quarterly Report

The real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the current 2009-10 fiscal year (FY10)
is likely to be around the annual target of 3.3 percent, higher than the 2.0 percent growth seen
in FYO9, according to the State Bank of Pakistan’s First Quarterly Report on the State of the
Economy for FY10 which was released today.

“The major impetus for this growth is expected to come from the services sector,” the
Report said and added that the prospects of returning to macroeconomic stability have
improved in the initial months of FY10 as most of the key indicators continue positive trends
that began in the closing months of the last fiscal year.

According to projections embodied in the Report, real GDP growth in FY10 is likely to be
between 2.5% and 3.5%, average Consumer Price Index inflation may remain between 10% and
12%, total amount of workers’ remittances likely to receive during FY10 may hover between
$7.8billion and $8.8 billion, total exports and imports may remain between $18.5 billion and
$19.0 billion, $30.5 billion and $31 billion, respectively while fiscal and current account deficits
are likely to be between 4.7% and 5.2% and 3.7% and 4.7% of GDP, respectively.

It said that data on agriculture and the industrial sector, is in line with the expectations
of a modest recovery in economic growth during FY10. While the performance of major crops
during FY10 kharif (April-October 2009) cropping season was below expectations, growth in
large-scale manufacturing has recovered substantially after recording a 20.6 percent year-on-
year decline in March 2009. Similarly, a sharp reduction in inflation, contained government
borrowings from SBP, substantial contraction in external imbalances, the stability in the rupee-
USS parity, and easing monetary stance, are all likely to support economic stability, it said and
added that the drop in overall volume of trade, poor tax growth, risk of lower than expected aid
receipts and, in particular, a rise in the fiscal deficit, highlight the fragility of the improvement
and pose continuing risk to the recovery.

The Report said that within the commodity producing sector, an improvement in
industrial output is expected to be partially offset by weaker agriculture. Similarly, the current
account deficit is likely to improve further in FY10 relative to the previous year, though some
expected revival in import demand from manufacturing and rising commodity prices may
possibly contain the improvement going forward, it added.

It pointed out that while average CPI inflation during FY10 is projected to decelerate
significantly from FYO9 levels, it is likely to remain higher than the annual target of 9.0 percent
for the year. “The adjustment in administered prices of key fuels amid rising international oil

SBP Governor forms Special Committee to devise
strategy for growth of agricultural credit

Mr. Shahid H Kardar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has constituted a Special
Committee which will devise a strategy in consultation with the Federal and Provincial
Governments and other stakeholders for the growth of the agricultural credit in the country.

While chairing a meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held at
the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi this morning, Mr. Kardar said that the Committee would
consist of representatives from the State Bank, commercial banks, agri. chambers and
associations. He said that the Committee would hold meaningful discussions at the Federal and
Provincial level to formulate a holistic strategy for the development of agricultural credit with
the consensus of all the major stakeholders.

The Committee will be headed by Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Executive Director,
Development Finance Group of SBP while Mr. Mansoor Hassan Siddiqui, Director SME Finance
Department of the State Bank, Mr. Ziaullah Khan, Senior Executive Vice President, Agriculture
Group, National Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Abid Sattar, Head Retail and Consumer Group, Habib
Bank Limited, Mr. Farooq Abid Tung, Executive Vice-President and Country Head, Agriculture,
Askari Commercial Bank, Mr. Mansoor Arifeen, CEO Icepak Ltd., Mr. Sultan Barg, Chief
Executive Specialists Group Inc./farmer and Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar of Sindh Agriculture
Chamber would be members of the committee.

Mr. Kardar urged the banks to understand the needs of the economy and improve their
penetration in the sector, as it is commercially viable offering attractive potential cash flows
and extensive backward and forward linkages in the value chain. “Banks need to develop a
comprehensive agricultural finance policy, dedicated human resource, simplified procedures
and other prerequisites for building lending portfolios and timely provision of credit to
farmers,” he added.

He said that the Federal & Provincial governments, revenue departments, farmers’
associations and other stakeholders also need to contribute to value addition of the sector
through automation of land records, marketing & storage channels, introduction of latest
farming techniques, efficient extension services, water management, etc. to facilitate the banks
in their endeavour to expand agri. finance as a viable business line.

The SBP Governor informed the participants that the agriculture sector was not only the
largest sector of the country’s economy, it was also the source of livelihood for at least 45 % of
the total employed labour force in the country, and added that adequate availability & access

It may be mentioned here that this year SBP had decided to fully utilize huge network of
over 9,000 branches of commercial banks for distribution of fresh currency notes of all
denominations to the general public during the holy month of Ram azan.

For this purpose, the SBPBSC had made elaborate arrangements for the supply of
adequate quantity of fresh currency notes of all denominations in general and small
denomination (Rs 5 to Rs 50) in particular to commercial banks depending upon their branch
network. Each of the 16 field offices of SBPBSC provided fresh currency notes to the designated
branch of each commercial bank. These branches were responsible for delivery of these notes
in quantities commensurate to the size of their branch, as per plan pre-notified to the
concerned office of the SBPBSC.

The SBPBSC has put in place a mechanism for penalizing the banks in case of any
irregularity is committed by them in issuance of the fresh currency notes. In this regard, SBPBSC
has constituted committees which will look into complaints of the general public about non-
availability or black marketing of fresh currency notes. Penalty will also be imposed on banks
found violating SBP instructions with regard to the issuance of notes to the general public.

During last Ramazan in 2009, an amount of Rs 20.250 million was recovered from
commercial banks whose branches violated SBP instructions in issuance of the fresh currency
notes.

It may be recalled that the State Bank/SBPBSC last year had issued 826.73 million of
pieces fresh currency notes worth 75.91 billion from 3"" Ram zan-ulM ubarak till the last

Pakistan’s banking sector well placed to withstand
modest shocks: Shahid Kardar

The banking sector in Pakistan has been able to withstand headwinds from weakening
macroeconomic fundamentals since 2007. Although banks face increased credit risk, the overall sector is
well placed to withstand modest shocks as they build their inventory of government securities. This was
stated by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Shahid H. Kardar in a message embodied in SBP
Annual Report on the working of the Bank (Performance Review) for the year 2009-10 (FY10) which was
released today.

‘Furthermore, in response to emerging dynamics in the macro-financial environment, the SBP has
rationalized the minimum capital requirement and its implementation schedule, which will provide breathing
space to the banking sector in this difficult macroeconomic environment’, he said and added that the State
Bank continued to strive for a balance between price stability and support for economic growth while
safeguarding the soundness and stability of the financial system during FY10.

While highlighting some of the key policy measures undertaken by SBP during FY10, Mr. Kardar
said that in response to a changing inflation outlook, SBP adjusted its stance on monetary policy. The
decline in inflation during the initial months of FY10 and a relative improvement in the macroeconomic
situation, allowed the central bank to ease its monetary policy stance, he said and added that as the growing
fiscal deficit and unexpectedly low external receipts increased risks of a relapse into macroeconomic
instability, and as inflationary pressures resurfaced in H2-FY10, SBP decided to pause the easing cycle and
subsequently increased its policy rate in July and September 2010.

He said that the State Bank had increased the frequency of its monetary policy statements from four
to six times a year. With a view to improving communication with the market the monetary policy
framework itself experienced significant change when the SBP introduced an interest rate corridor in August
2009. “This framework has anchored short-term interest rates and improved liquidity management in the
money market,” he added.

The SBP Governor pointed out that the exchange rate during FY10 continued to reflect market
conditions, which helped narrow the external imbalance and improve macroeconomic stability. Foreign
exchange reserves, which were at $12.425 billion at the close of FY09, increased by $4.325 billion to reach
an all time high of $16.750 at the close of FY10, he said and added that SBP’s decision to enhance banks’
Foreign Exchange Exposure Limit also strengthened the market’s capacity to handle larger volumes of
foreign exchange transactions without additional volatility in the exchange rate.

Mr. Kardar said that the State Bank launched an Electronic Bond Trading Platform in January 2010
for the development of fixed-income markets. ‘This system, which primarily focused on government
securities, also has the capacity to support trading of corporate debt instruments,’ he added.

Cost efficiency of Pakistan’s banking industry improving over time:
Prof. Kent Matthews

Prof. Kent Matthews, Sir Julian Hodge Professor of Banking and Finance, Cardiff
University, UK today said that improved competitiveness of Pakistan’s banking industry has
resulted in higher level of cost efficiency thereby increasing the effectiveness of financial
intermediation.

Delivering a lecture on “Banking Efficiency in Emerging Market Economies” at National
Institute of Banking & Finance (NIBAF) in Islamabad, Prof. Matthews said that the efficiency of
the banks is an indicator of the efficiency of financial intermediation. The banking sector of the
emerging economies is facing stronger competition due to the globalisation of the financial
system,” he said and added that while the trend in deregulation and global competition will be
muted for the next few years as a result of the financial crisis, the pace will pick up once the
world economy is stabilised.

The lecture, organized by the State Bank of Pakistan, is the 17™ such event held as a part
of Zahid Hussain Memorial Lecture Series instituted in 1973.

Prof. Matthews in his lecture reviewed the different ways to measure bank efficiency
and highlighted the results of research on bank efficiency in Asian emerging economies. In
particular, the lecture outlined the extent of research thus far conducted on the efficiency of
banks in Pakistan and how to build and improve upon them.

He stressed that banking efficiency is a worthy topic as it not only measures the overall
efficacy of the banking system but also allows the evaluation of banks’ intermediary role.
Furthermore, knowledge on the banking efficiency helps assess the smoothness with which
monetary policy transmits through the banking channel. He explained that for banks to be cost
effective one needs to be able to assess their levels of technical and allocative efficiencies. He
said that the concept of technical efficiency is the ability of a bank to maximize its output from
the given set of inputs e.g. a bank may be technically inefficient due to low levels of training,
human capital and the use of inferior technology. Allocative inefficiency is the inability to
reallocate inputs in their optimal proportions given their respective prices, he added.

Prof. Matthews highlighted the necessity to formulate policies promoting convergence
of cost efficiency within the Pakistani banks.

Earlier, Mr. Shahid H. Kardar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan welcomed the distinguished
speaker, the chief guest Mr. Nasir Aslam Zahid and introduced the guest speaker to a select group
of audience that included senior bankers, policy makers and senior officials of the State Bank.

Mr. Justice (Retired) Nasir Aslam Zahid — the son of Mr. Zahid Husain, the first Governor
of the State Bank of Pakistan — presided over the function. In his speech Mr. Zahid recounted
the numerous achievements of his father.

State Bank decides to keep the policy rate
unchanged at 12.5 percent: Syed Salim Raza

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged
at 12.5 percent. This was announced by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,
Syed Salim Raza while unveiling the Monetary Policy Statement at a press
conference held at SBP, Karachi this afternoon.

Mr. Raza said that macroeconomic stability has proceeded apace, as
evident in the considerable decline in average Consumer Price Index inflation —
which is the primary objective of monetary policy. In the first half of the current
2009-10 fiscal year (FY10) inflation recorded at 10.3 percent, compared to 24.4
percent during H1-FY09, he said and added that this decline is visible across
almost all the subgroups of CPI.

“The inflation outlook for full FY10, nevertheless, remains somewhat
vulnerable to the effects of fiscal consolidation efforts and to incipient
international commodity price pressures,” he said and added that the State Bank
expects the average CPI inflation for FY10 to remain between 11 and 12 percent,
still much lower than the 20.8 percent inflation of last year, but higher than the
10.3 percent recorded in the first half of FY10.

Talking about the real economy, Mr. Raza said that the agriculture sector
has shown improvement and the wheat crop was good with higher prices
stimulating demand for consumer goods, and the cotton crop higher than last
year improving textile production and corresponding exports. Modest but
consistent recovery in Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) is also encouraging, he
said and added that the LSM grew by 0.7 percent in November 2009 compared to
a low of negative 20 percent in March 2009. “Revival in private sector credit and
better-than-expected global recovery should further support economic growth,”
he added.

Assuming that the current trend in LSM growth continues, the Governor
said and added that the overall real Gross Domestic Product growth is expected
to be 3.0 —3.5 percent in FY10, as compared to 2.0 percent in FYO9.

the last fiscal year. The amount of $4,531.08 million includes $0.99 million received through
encashment and profit earned on Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates (FEBCs) and Foreign
Currency Bearer Certificates (FCBCs).

In December 2009, an amount of $698.44 million was sent home by overseas Pakistanis,

Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan and other countries during December 2009
amounted to $60.33 million compared with $75.66 million in the same month last year.

It may be pointed out that the State Bank, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Overseas

Shahid Kardar stresses upon coordinated response to
changing macroeconomic environment

Mr. Shahid H. Kardar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the future strategy
to control inflation must include coordinated and timely response to changing macroeconomic
conditions along with a concerted effort to raise the productive capacity of the economy.

Addressing members of the business community at the Federation of Pakistan
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Karachi today, Mr. Kardar stressed that any
delay in implementing such a strategy would only make the policy trade-offs much more
difficult resulting in continuing uncertainty regarding desirable economic outcomes.

Responding to various queries regarding Monetary Policy, SBP Governor said that
Monetary Policy has played its part in correcting the macroeconomic imbalances, but other
government policies have not been that supportive. “Had the SBP not responded, the inflation
outlook and reserve position of the country would have been worse,” he added.

Mr. Kardar explained that the growth in broad money and thus inflation would have
been much higher if the private sector had also continued to borrow unchecked from the
banking system along with the public sector. He said some observers can comment that
availability of cheap credit to the private sector would have supplemented productive capacity,
helping reduce the output gap but given the deterioration in the law and order conditions and
energy sector problems in the last three years, it is highly unlikely that investments in the
country, by both local and foreign investors, would have grown rapidly.

“Thus in any case, rising inflation would have made the businesses uncompetitive by
increasing the cost of production,” he said and explained that what we have learned about the
dynamics of inflation in Pakistan is that in broad terms, inflationary pressures have been a mix
of upward adjustments in administrated prices, a persistence of output gap and inconsistent
macroeconomic policies negatively influencing expectations of inflation.

Mr. Kardar said that in cumulative terms, Pakistan’s economy has experienced an
inflation of 66 percent between June 2007 and October 2010. “This is almost twice the level of
inflation seen during June 2003 and June 2007, which was 36 percent,” he added.

He said that the credit extended for ‘commodity operations’, including both wheat and
sugar, grew by 288 percent during the last three years compared to 33 percent in the three
years before that. “Borrowings of this scale would not have been possible without an upward
pressure on market interest rates,” he said and added that the borrowing of government
agencies for financing its wheat, urea, and sugar trading operations was Rs 382 billion at just

Pakistan’s economy likely to sustain
growth revival in FY10: State Bank Quarterly Report

Pakistan is likely to sustain revival of economic growth during the current fiscal year
(2009-10) because of an above-target recovery in manufacturing, strong rebound by the
construction sector, reasonable performance by the services sector and strong domestic
consumer demand, according to the State Bank of Pakistan’s Second Quarterly Report on the
State of the Economy for FY10 which was released today.

State Bank’s estimates for FY10 gross domestic product (GDP) growth remain
unchanged from the previous quarter, with real GDP growth for the year projected to fall in the
range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. It pointed out that the resurgence in inflationary pressures
due to revival in aggregate demand, exchange rate pass-through, etc. have, so far, not
exceeded levels already embedded in the earlier SBP forecasts. The annual headline CPI
inflation projection for FY10 also remains unchanged and it is estimated to be in the range of
11.0 percent to 12.0 percent, the Report said.

Encouragingly, due to a better than expected performance by the exports in recent
months and robust performance of remittances earlier in the year, the current account deficit
has narrowed more than projected earlier. Thus, even incorporating relatively less positive
trend in months ahead, it seems likely that the full year FY10 deficit will be lower than earlier
SBP forecasts. “Current projections suggest that the FY10 current account deficit is likely to fall
in the range of 3.2 percent to 3.8 percent of GDP, which represents a 0.5 percent to 1.1 percent
of GDP improvement from the earlier estimates,” it added.

But SBP’s Report pointed out that FY10 fiscal deficit is estimated to be higher on
account of extraordinary defense related spending and weakness in revenue collection. In
recent consultations with IMF, need for a cut in PSDP and relaxation in fiscal deficit target was
also recognized, it said and added that the fiscal deficit is projected to lie in the range of 5.0
percent to 5.5 percent of GDP during FY10.

The State Bank’s Report stressed that the country’s overall economic outlook ‘is mixed.’
While inflation decelerated significantly during FY10 compared with the preceding year,
inflationary pressures have decisively remerged in recent months, it said and added that
although, the current account deficit witnessed improvement, sustaining it at low levels will be
challenging given rising import requirements of the economy, and evident weakness in the pace
of growth in remittances. “Prospects for real GDP growth are better relative to the preceding
year. However, this level of growth is not adequate to generate required employment
opportunities,” it pointed out.

Kamran Shehzad terms launch of MF-CIB as significant step
towards improving risk management

Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has termed the
launch of pilot Microfinance Credit Information Bureau (MF-CIB) as a significant step towards
improved risk management practices and reducing over-indebtedness of low-income clients.

Speaking at the launching ceremony of MF-CIB, which is a joint venture of Pakistan
Microfinance Network (PMN), UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), Citi-
Foundation and the State Bank of Pakistan at a local hotel in Lahore today, Mr. Kamran said
that MF-CIB will not only strengthen and expand the microfinance sector, but also create a
healthier credit culture, identify credit-worthy borrowers, reduce instances of over-borrowing
and fraud. “The Microfinance CIB will also aid policy instruments by providing accurate
indebtedness and delinquency information,” he added.

SBP Deputy Governor said that this pilot Bureau will provide a valuable opportunity for
the microfinance sector to experience the benefits of a fully functional credit bureau. “The
benefits include prompt determination of potential borrower’s credit worthiness, streamlined
credit investigation process, timely repayment due to efficient reporting and reduction of
lenders’ losses,” he said and added that borrowers will also be indirect beneficiary of this
facility in the form of increased availability of credit, lower borrowing costs and an incentive to
build credit history.

However, Mr. Kamran emphasized that the pilot MF-CIB must ensure impartiality and
integrity as its ultimate success will depend on the amount and accuracy of both credit and
demographic information contained in the database. “State Bank looks forward to the success
and positive outcomes of this grand initiative and would like to congratulate PMN and its
collaborators on the launch of pilot MF-CIB, which will go a long way in developing the
microfinance sector on sound footing,” he added.

Referring to the growth of microfinance sector in the country, Mr. Kamran said that the

sector has grown rapidly in recent years as the number of microfinance borrowers increased

Fiscal discipline and restrictions on Govt. borrowing necessary

to contain inflation: SBP Third Quarterly Report

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that fiscal discipline and restrictions on Government borrowing
from SBP are necessary to contain inflationary expectations, which have become ingrained in recent months,
according to State Bank’s Third Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for FY11 released today.

‘In overall terms, although the post-flood hike in CPI inflation has largely dissipated, inflation is stubborn,
in excess of 13 percent. Possible reasons could include: (a) the lagged impact of government borrowings from SBP
during Jul-Sep 2010; (b) frequent upward adjustments in utility and POL prices; (c) increase in commodity prices;
and (d) the rising trend in the house rent index (HRI),’ the Report observed.

The Report said the Government is facing difficulties in containing the fiscal deficit. SBP Report stressed
that implementation of fiscal reforms still poses political challenges. ‘For instance, structural problems that require
difficult policy decisions for fiscal consolidation (e.g. expanding the base of GST through the withdrawal of
exemptions, tax on agri-income, and restructuring and privatization of PSEs) are pending resolution and awaiting
multi-partisan consensus,’ the Report added.

As far as financing is concerned, the Report observed that the Government has had little option but to
rely on domestic sources to finance a growing fiscal gap. More specifically, while borrowing from SBP was largely
contained at end-September 2010 levels, the abrupt change from April 2011 onwards (the Government borrowed
over Rs 350 billion from the central bank during 31* March — a"" May 2011) were largely meant to internalize the
growing quasi-fiscal expense (e.g. the circular debt in energy) into the budget. In other words, this borrowing is
actually financing the carry-over of quasi-fiscal deficits from previous years, according to the Report.

The SBP Report further said that the impact of the widening fiscal deficit is clearly visible in the sharply
rising domestic debt. Outstanding Government domestic debt reached Rs 5,594 billion (31.8 percent of estimated
GDP) which is more than double the stock at end-June 2007, the Report said and added that this sharp growth in
debt stock is fueling concerns about macro stability and monetary management.

‘In addition, the maturity profile of domestic debt reveals that the government has to rollover the entire
stock of Rs 2,854 billion of short term debt at least once a year. Any surge in credit demand from other sectors of
the economy could elevate rollover risk, and could also expose the government to interest rate risk,’ the Report
added.

In terms of fiscal management, going forward, desirable revenue generating measures (e.g. broadening of
the tax base, improving documentation of the economic system, gradual elimination of un-targeted subsidies and
curtailment of quasi-fiscal operations) are necessary to contain the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 percent of GDP in
FY12, the Report said, adding that these efforts need to be accompanied with better debt management to increase
the tenor of domestic debt and lower risks associated with debt re-pricing and rollover.

While emphasizing on significant improvement in the external sector, the Report said that the rising prices
of value added textiles and strong growth in remittances are main factors that pushed the current account into a
surplus of USS 748 million (Jul-Apr 2011) from a deficit of USS 3.5 billion in the corresponding period of the
preceding year. Textile exports managed to post strong growth despite efforts by competitor countries to hinder
concessionary access of Pakistani products in developed markets, the Report said and added that the steady
growth in remittances is a welcome development — for the first time in Pakistan’s history, monthly remittances
crossed the USS1 billion mark for two consecutive months (March and April 2011).

SBP allows relaxations in EFS
to facilitate exporters

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed some relaxations in the Export Finance
Scheme (EFS) for the benefit of exporters whose export proceeds are overdue.

An exporter shall be eligible to avail financing under EFS Part-! and/or Part-ll, if the total
amount of overdue export bills at the time of availing the facility is not more than 5% of the
previous year’s export performance, says IH & SMEFD Circular No. 08 of July 23, 2011.

In case the overdue export position of an exporter is greater than 5% of the previous
year’s exports, the exporter will not be entitled to avail the EFS facility till such time that the
overdue position is reduced to the 5% benchmark level, the Circular said, adding that these
instructions, which will come into effect from October 01, 2011, have been issued by SBP to
streamline the procedure for availing finance under EFS by exporters who have overdue export
proceeds.

Each exporter will be required to give a Certificate on a prescribed Form showing
consolidated position of overdue export bills outstanding against all bank(s) {as per the record
of Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD)}, as a percentage of the total exports of
the preceding year finalized in EE-1 statements. The Certificate will be submitted through the
bank to the concerned SBP BSC office on a six monthly basis by 31st March & September 30,
each year, the Circular said, adding that the certificate will remain valid up to the next six
months. Process of submission of the certificate would commence from September 2011.

The State Bank has communicated the necessary guidelines to the banks for processing
the requests of exporters with overdue export proceeds for availing the finance under Export
Finance Scheme. Any misreporting/misstatement shall attract imposition of fine on
bank/exporter at the rate prescribed under the Scheme, the Circular added.

Moreover, the concerned SBP BSC office(s) shall verify the export overdue position of
the exporter from relevant data and check the 5% benchmark, the Circular said and added that
in normal cases this practice shall be adopted twice a year before granting refinance.

The existing waiver for exporters with overdue export bills is being extended up to
September 30, 2011 to cover the period until the certificate is submitted by the exporters for

the first time, the Circular added.

Economy grows by 2.4% in FY11 despite
devastating floods: SBP Annual Report

Pakistan’s economy managed to grow by 2.4 percent in fiscal year 2010-11 (FY11), despite devastating
floods in the early part of FY11, says the State Bank’s Annual Report on the State of the Economy released today.

It said that one-fifth of the country’s agricultural heartland was inundated, which interrupted production
processes and disrupted the subsequent supply of both labor and capital. It is estimated that 6.6 million of
Pakistan’s labor force was out of work for 2 to 3 months, and capital stock worth USS 2.6 billion (1.2 percent of
GDP) was lost, the Report added.

SBP Report said that while the international response to the devastation was below expectations, it is
commendable that the government was able to address these challenges despite severe fiscal constraints.
Furthermore, the inherent resilience of the agri. sector allowed it to post a bumper wheat crop in the rabi season
and sizable production of minor crops (potato, onion, pulses, etc.), which spearheaded the revival, the Report said,
adding that a spontaneous community effort towards rehabilitation and government support in the form of cash
payments to flood affectees and providing free seeds and fertilizers, allowed the country to overcome this natural
disaster.

According to the Report, the manufacturing sector suffered a serious setback. Industrial growth was
negative 0.1 percent in FY11, due to flood-driven supply chain interruptions; prolonged power outages; and
reduction in gas supplies. Services, on the other hand, supported growth on the back of a rise in government
salaries and defense spending. The overall growth in services was 4.1 percent in FY11, which was lower than the
target 4.7 percent, but this still accounted for 90 percent of real GDP growth, the Report added.

It said that Pakistan’s fiscal position remained under stress during FY11, with a budget deficit of 6.6
percent of GDP, compared to a target of 4.0 percent. The implementation of the reformed general sales tax; the
broadening of the income tax net to include agriculture and services; the phasing out of subsidies in a timely
manner; and the restructuring of loss-making public sector enterprises — were either delayed, or not implemented,
the Report added.

On a positive note, the government was able to contain its spending compared to FY10. Budgetary
expenditure in FY11 was 18.9 percent of GDP, against 20.5 percent in the preceding year, the Report said, adding
that the large fiscal deficit directly impacted Pakistan’s debt burden, as the stock of public debt and liabilities
(accumulated deficits) posted an increase of Rs 1,763 billion in FY11, to Rs 11.0 trillion (60.9 percent of GDP).
Interest payments alone accounted for 32.8 percent of government revenues last fiscal year, which means a
further squeeze on the government's ability to use fiscal policy to promote economic growth, it added.

However, Pakistan’s external debt remains comfortable, especially within the context of the acute
problems facing the Eurozone, the Report said and added that during FY11, most of the increase was on account of
currency revaluation, as the dollar lost value against other hard currencies. The funding that Pakistan actually
received during FY11 was largely utilized for the servicing of external debt, it added.

SBP Report stressed that the financing of the fiscal deficit was, and still remains, challenging. ‘With a
decline in external funding following the suspension of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), the government had
little choice but to rely increasingly on domestic sources. During FY11, the government borrowed Rs 1.1 trillion
from domestic resources, which accounted for 91.0 percent of the fiscal deficit,’ it said, adding that within
domestic sources, the heavy reliance on commercial banks not only crowded-out the private sector, but also
complicated monetary management, as banks focused increasingly on short-term T-bills to place their surplus
liquidity.

Kamran Shehzad urges Islamic banks to
diversify their investment portfolios

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed
upon the Islamic banks to diversify their investment portfolios by enhancing financing to Small and
Medium Enterprises (SMEs), agriculture, housing finance and microfinance sectors of the country.

Delivering his keynote address at a two-day World Islamic Finance Summit 2011 at a local
hotel in Karachi today, he said that Islamic banks can not only increase their depth and breadth but
also contribute to higher financial inclusion levels in the country by targeting these underserved
sectors of the economy as the share of these sectors in overall Islamic financing is very low despite
their significant contribution in Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

SBP Deputy Governor observed that the business model of current paradigm of Islamic
banking industry both at domestic and international level has a relatively lower mix of participatory
modes such as Musharka and Mudarba. ‘Moving closer to these modes will help Islamic banking
industry to bring in their fold clientele such as SME that has been ignored by conventional finance
industry because of its relatively high risk perception’, he added.

He noted with concern that the overall financing by Islamic banking industry in agriculture
remains below 3 percent. ‘A country like Pakistan where agriculture has the highest contribution in
domestic production, Islamic banks can increase their market share by reaching out this sector’, he
added.

Mr. Kamran Shehzad said that housing finance, particularly the low cost housing, is another
largely untapped area which the Islamic banks can venture by developing suitable products. Islamic
microfinance is also an important area where Islamic banks can serve people, who remain
unbanked due to their inability of meeting criteria of commercial banks, he observed.

He said that to encourage the industry to venture into participatory modes of financing,
State Bank has constituted a Task Force having representation of Islamic banks, business
community, academia and accounting professionals to develop an incentive framework for
promotion of such products. ‘This framework will be aimed at encouraging Islamic banks to offer
participatory modes while minimizing issues of moral hazard, adverse selection, information
asymmetries and trust deficit between Islamic banking institutions (IBls) and entrepreneurs,’ he
added.

He said that SBP has played a key role in facilitating Islamic banking industry to reach a point
of recognition both at the local and international level. State Bank while being a regulator, has also
remained committed to being a facilitator for the industry; it is one of the few regulators that have
introduced comprehensive legal, regulatory and Shariah compliance framework for Islamic banking
industry, he said. ‘Moreover, SBP has issued model agreements for encouraging standardization

State Bank reduces policy rate by 50 bps to 13.5%

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to reduce its policy rate by 50 basis points
to 13.5 percent with effect from August 01, 2011. This was announced by Mr. Yaseen Anwar,
Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, while unveiling the Monetary Policy Statement at a
press conference held at SBP, Karachi today.

The key parameter in this assessment is the outlook of inflation that indicates that
average inflation in FY12 is expected to remain in line with the announced target, he said,
adding that no adjustment in the interest rate would have entailed further tightening of
monetary policy in real terms, which is not warranted given the decline in private investment.

Mr. Anwar said that despite fiscal slippages, the government has adhered to restricting
the stock of its borrowings from SBP to Rs1155 billion (on cash basis). ‘In fact, the government
retired these borrowings compared to both the end-June 2010 level as well as the mutually
agreed limit of end-September 2010 level,’ he added.

He said the government has also expressed its commitment to continue with a stance of
zero borrowings from SBP in yearly flow terms in FY12, which bodes well for anchoring inflation
expectations. He, however, observed that the developments related to expected financial
inflows and pattern of government borrowings from scheduled banks will need to be
monitored closely to assess potential risks for macroeconomic stability.

SBP Acting Governor said that a relative decline in average CPI inflation compared to
earlier projections and a gradual buildup of foreign exchange reserves provide a modicum of
macroeconomic stability as the economy begins a new fiscal year.

Mr. Anwar noted that expectations of inflation are fairly entrenched in the economy.
‘Thus, a meaningful reduction in inflation would require consistent and credible
implementation of monetary and fiscal policies,’ he added.

He observed that acknowledging the persistence of inflation, the government has
announced an inflation target of 12 percent for FY12. ‘The government has also provided in the
Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) a desired path of inflation of 9.5 percent and 8
percent for the subsequent two years,’ he said, adding that conditional upon factors such as
adjustments in the administered prices of electricity and oil and a projected broad money (M2)
growth of 15 to 16 percent, SBP’s forecast of average inflation ranges between 11 and 12
percent during FY12.

‘The underlying reasons of growing government borrowings are structural and not
specific to FY11 though it must be acknowledged that FY11 was a difficult year given floods and
other pressing spending needs. The consolidated fiscal data has not been released, however,
provisional estimates from the financing side indicate that the fiscal deficit in FY11 may have
reached close to Rs1127 billion or 6.2 percent of GDP. Excluding the one-off payment of Rs120
billion to partially settle the circular debt in the energy sector, the fiscal deficit in FY11 comes
down to 5.6 percent of GDP,’ he added.

impressive ceremony held at State Bank, Karachi on July 1, 2011.

Speaking on the occasion, he said that he was extremely delighted that one of his

was started in my tenure yet its completion is the result of the relentless efforts of my

Appreciating the efforts of SBP Governor, he said that Mr. Kardar is a person who

‘lam grateful to him and all those who contributed to this project, which is unique in
nature,’ he remarked.

He said that there is hardly any central bank in the world, which does not have a
monetary museum. Having a monetary museum is a usual function of a central bank, he
added.

Dr. Ishrat Husain said that when the idea of establishing a monetary museum was
conceived, there was a library in this building. Realizing the historical value of this
building, we shifted the library to Learning Resource Centre (LRC) and decided to utilize
this building for SBP Museum and Art Gallery, he added.

‘One of the reasons of establishing the museum in this building was that we
always wanted to preserve the original character of this monumental and historical
building. Moreover, we also wanted to preserve the gems of world’s great artist,
Sadequain that were acquired by the former SBP Governor, Mr. S.A. Hasnie during his

Over 400,000 branchless/mobile banking
accounts opened in past 18 months: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has disclosed that over 400,000
branchless/mobile banking accounts have been opened collectively by banks and more than ten million financial
transactions took place during the past one and a half year in the country. ‘Through branchless banking, billions of
rupees of funds have been transferred from person -to- person, account -to- account, account -to- person, person -
to- account and government -to- people’, he added.

Addressing the 4"" International Mobile Commerce Conference in Pakistan at a local hotel in Karachi today,
he said that the market for fund transfer and other banking services in Pakistan is not confined to rural areas only as
urban locations also hold significant potential for many aspects of financial services. ‘To serve the needs of this low
income vulnerable segment of society, living both in urban & rural areas, banks now offer branchless banking
services and have developed a network of over 14000 agents across the country providing branchless banking
services. ‘All this has developed in only 1-1/2 years as compared to the total number of bank branches of 10,000
over a span of 63 years,’ he added.

He observed that while branchless/mobile banking in Pakistan is still at its infancy, the results have been
encouraging and people have become believers that their banking needs may be fulfilled via a nearby general store
or mobile balance load shop or a petrol pump or a neighborhood grocery store. ‘We also have the support and trust
of international development agencies & stakeholders on State Bank regulated bank-led model of branchless
banking,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said the State Bank of Pakistan issued branchless banking regulations in 2008 and today ‘we have
Tameer Bank’s easypaisa, UBL’s OMNI, MCB Mobile, KASB Mobile and HBL-Ufone providing branchless/ mobile
banking services.’ He disclosed that aside from Dubai Islamic Bank which is currently pilot testing its deployment,
several other banks are in the pipeline intending to offer branchless banking as well. He said that a number of
different stakeholders in Pakistan are ready to play their part in branchless banking as the central bank is
encouraging innovative products and services in the financial sector in line with its financial inclusion program. He
expressed the hope that the synergic nature and critical role of all partners will definitely pave the way for financial
inclusion and would make Pakistan a global example in the area of financial inclusion, consumer protection, access
to finance and poverty reduction.

Appreciating the role of banking industry, he said the banks have done a commendable job by channeling
the transfers of Government of Pakistan’s and multilateral donor agencies’ funds for flood victims and internally
displaced people by employing their branchless banking infrastructure and mobile phone devices.

He said that the strong economic growth of Pakistan’s economy during the last decade witnessed two
sectors that reported strongest growth rates: banking and telecom. Both of these sectors attracted significant
foreign direct investment in Pakistan. ‘The rapid penetration of cellular phone technology has the potential to
elevate financial inclusion provided both sectors mutually develop a better understanding,’ he added.

He observed that the advancements in Information & Communications Technology that have transformed
our lives over the past ten-twelve years, also have the powerful potential to change the lives of Pakistan’s poor
people. ‘Technology has the potential to serve the financial needs of the unbanked poor,’ he added.

SBP Deputy Governor pointed out that there are also challenges attached with this emerging package of
mobile banking. He said the process of adapting to changes in our banks is slow while aggressive & rigorous
marketing efforts are also needed to achieve the desired upshots. He also stressed the need for creating trust in
consumers’ mind that non-bank agent locations providing financial services are safe places and mobile phones are
secure mediums to carryout financial transactions.

STATE BANK KEEPS POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 14 PERCENT

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 14 percent. This decision
was taken at a meeting of the Central Board of Directors of State Bank of Pakistan held under the chairmanship
of SBP Governor Mr. Shahid H. Kardar in Lahore today.

‘Given a favourable external current account position and relatively disciplined government borrowings
from SBP, the immediate risks to macroeconomic stability seem to have subsided, at least for the next two
months. Therefore, SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 14 percent,’ the State Bank said in its
Monetary Policy Decision.

It, however, said that there is little room for complacency as the risks to the economy may increase if
meaningful economic reforms are not initiated to address the structural weaknesses. Inflation persistence still
remains high, which is largely formed by recent past levels of inflation and perceptions of economic agents
about the credibility and direction of monetary and fiscal policies in controlling inflation and promoting long-
term sustainable economic growth.

It further said the current stability in the financial markets provides valuable time to initiate structural
reforms. Not only are urgent measures required to address the energy crisis to increase productive activity but
the fiscal position also needs considerable strengthening to cope with rising debt obligations and to ease
borrowing pressures on the banking system.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

“Despite a recent improvement in the external current account, restrained government borrowings
from SBP and stable financial markets, the focus must remain on addressing the structural fiscal weaknesses and
reducing inflation to provide a sound platform for sustainable economic recovery in FY12. Although some
measures have been announced to contain the fiscal deficit of FY11 and inflation has eased somewhat, more
work is required to build on these initial efforts by maintaining progress on comprehensive tax reforms,
transparent rationalization of subsidies, and the development of a forward-looking debt management strategy.
This will require support from across the political divide and from other state and civil society institutions to
ensure their smooth implementation. These measures would help check the level of government borrowings
from the banking system, creating space for the private sector and lowering their borrowing costs thereby
supporting the utilization and expansion of the economy’s productive capacity. Initiation of these reforms has
become critical since private and public sector investments are falling while total debt is rising sharply and
expectations of high inflation are becoming entrenched.

The decline in year-on-year inflation from 15.5 percent in December 2010 to 12.9 percent in February
2011 can be attributed to three factors. First, a gradual dissipation of the effect of the flood on food prices;

First nationwide Financial Literacy
Program to be launched shortly

The first ever initiative to promote the financial literacy among the general public at the
national level will be launched shortly. In this regard, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has signed a
contract with M/s Bearing Point Consultant as an implementing partner to launch a pilot nationwide
Financial Literacy Program (FLP).

This program will impart knowledge about the basic financial concepts such as budgeting,
savings, investments, debt management, financial products and branchless banking. The pilot phase
will target about 50,000 beneficiaries with emphasis on low income strata. Upon successful
completion of the pilot phase, the program will be scaled up to target more than 500,000 beneficiaries
from all over the country. The program will rely on partnerships with financial service providers and
network organization to outreach across various districts of Pakistan.

The FLP will increase financial inclusion and awareness about innovative alternate delivery
channels/branchless banking and also help people understand their rights and obligations. The
program will be disseminated by using myriad of communication channels i.e TV channels, regional
Radio, print media and mobile network operators for delivering basic knowledge of financial concepts.

The Program is being funded under the Government of Pakistan and Asian Development Bank
(ADB) sponsored Improving Access to Financial Service Fund (IAFSF) to promote financial literacy
initiatives in Pakistan.

The program has been approved after a thorough review by the IAFSF Committee with
representation from SBP, Pakistan Banks Association, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, Pakistan

Pakistan’s real GDP may grow up to 3 percent in
FY11: SBP First Quarterly Report

Pakistan’s real gross domestic product is likely to grow between 2 and 3 percent in the
current fiscal year (FY11) due to expected better contribution by the services sector, and
improvement in the performance by the commodity producing sectors, according to the First
Quarterly Report of the State Bank on the State of the Pakistan’s Economy which was released
today.

According to the Report, performance of the commodity producing sectors of the
economy is expected to improve in months ahead. However, expectations of a recovery in
agriculture will depend crucially on the wheat harvest (including increased production from the
rain-fed — “barani” - areas), and the livestock sector. Similarly, large-scale manufacturing
growth is expected to turn positive again in the months ahead, as strong agri-prices support
demand, and with the additional capacities coming on-line in some industries including
fertilizer, cement and steel, the Report added.

SBP Report said that growing macroeconomic imbalances in the economy are still quite
manageable but further delay in implementing critical structural adjustments risks significantly
increasing the future costs to the economy.

The Report pointed out that inflationary pressures have strengthened more than
anticipated during the first half of FY11. “A part of this, reflecting post-flood shocks will fade
away, as will part of the price rise of sugar, but the fiscal expansion, proposed reduction in
energy subsidies, and prospects of rising imported inflation will continue to drive inflationary
expectations,” the Report said. ‘Consequently, SBP estimates for FY11 inflation have been
revised upwards from 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent to 15.0 percent to 16.0 percent’, the Report
added.

The Report said that strong prices encourage farmers to invest in higher yields and
support domestic demand. ‘Therefore, the only sustainable way to protect low income groups
from inflation is by targeted subsidies and the creation of ample employment opportunities’,
the Report added.

‘In contrast to inflation, the current account deficit (CAD) is likely to deteriorate in H2-
FY11. A significantly strong growth in imports is expected to more than offset the gains from
rise in exports and workers’ remittances. The financing of the CAD will be challenging as
inflows under financial accounts are likely to be significantly lower. In this perspective, the
continuation of the structural adjustment program of IMF would be helpful in softening the

Bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement signed
between the central banks of Pakistan and China.

A landmark bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement (CSA) has been signed between State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) and the People’s Bank of China (PBC) in a ceremony held on 23 Dec.2011 in
Islamabad, Pakistan by Governor SBP Yaseen Anwar and Deputy Governor PBC Mr. DU Jinfu.

The bilateral CSA has been concluded in Chinese Yuan CNY 10 billion and Pakistan Rupee
PKR 140 billion for the purpose of promoting bilateral trade and investment and strengthening
financial cooperation. The currency swap would expire in three years, but could be extended
with mutual consent.

We expect that bi-lateral Trade and investment will grow between Pakistan and China as a result
of this agreement, further augmenting the economic ties of the two countries. This agreement
will make a significant contribution in further strengthening the close and special relationship
between the two countries.

Announcement of the Currency Swap Agreement between the two Central Banks will give
positive signal to the market on the availability of liquidity of the other country’s currency on the
onshore market. As a result it will promote bi-lateral trade denominated in Chinese Yuan and

Pakistan Rupee.

Banking system assets grow by 8% to Rs 7.7 trillion
in Jan-June 2011: SBP Financial Stability Review

The assets of Pakistan’s banking system soared by 8 % or Rs 577 billion to Rs. 7.7 trillion during the first half
of calendar year 2011 (January-June, 2011). This surge in banks’ total assets, both in absolute and growth terms,
was the most significant since 2007, says the State Bank of Pakistan’s Financial Stability Review (FSR) released
today.

Deposits increased by 9.4%, registering the highest half yearly growth during the last four years, it said,
adding that net investments, with an increase of 22.4% during the first half of 2011, markedly outpaced the anemic
growth of 1.04% in net advances.

The first-half yearly Review said that banks’ profits before tax were up by 31% during the first half of 2011
to reach Rs. 77 billion, with Return On Assets (ROA) of 2.1% (1.8 % in June-10) and Return On Equity (ROE) of 21.9
% (17.7% in June-10). During Jan-June 2011, banks remained fairly liquid on the back of growing share of
investments in government papers, it said, adding that further, banks’ capital adequacy ratio also observed
improvement, reaching 14.1% by June-2011.

It said that concentration in profits have dropped (share of top 5 banks down from 95 % in Dec-10 to 78 %
in June-11), ensuring that even smaller banks have a share, albeit marginal, in industry profits. Further, growing
profits have also helped reduce the number of loss making banks, from 17 in June-10 to 8 in June-11,’ it said.
However, the Review cautioned that source of profits is shifting away from interest income through advances to
investments in government papers. Specifically, returns from investments in government papers now accounts for
almost 30 % of banks’ interest income, up from 24 % in June-2010, it added.

This suggests that growth in government borrowings has shored up banks’ earnings, the Review said and
added that this trend is neither desirable nor sustainable, first because it compromises intermediation function
and second as any sharp cut in discount rate can discernibly affect banks’ profits.

The Review stressed that there has been growing evidence of banks’ flight towards quality as net
investments, mainly in government securities, now constitute around 34 % of banks’ assets compared with 28 % in
June, 2010. ‘The share of net advances has witnessed a concomitant drop, from 47.6 to 43.9 % during the same
period’, it said and added that unsurprisingly, Advances-to-Deposits ratio has further dropped from 63.0 % in June,
2010 to 56.7 % by June, 2011.

According to the Review, while government’s reliance on the banking sector heightens the concerns about
private sector crowding out, poor credit off-take by the private sector has other causes as well that include severe
energy crises and challenging economic environment.

Credit risk remained a major challenge as banks accumulated Rs. 31 billion of fresh Non-Performing Loans,
pushing infection ratio from 14.7 % to 15.3%, the Review said and added that public sector commercial banks and
mid-sized local private banks appear more vulnerable to higher credit risk. However, going forward, the results of
the stress tests showed that the banking system is resilient to shocks emanating from a challenging
macroeconomic and business environment, it observed.

The Review said that Islamic banking institutions (IBls) have registered 17.5% growth during H1-CY11,
with bulk of incremental assets channeled into government securities. Islamic banks appear more liquid, solvent
and profitable when compared with rest of the banking sector but face unique risks like reputational risk and
displaced commercial risk, it said.

Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture

Best way to use finance is to promote
well-being of the poor :Prof. Banerjee

Dr. Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) has said the best way to use finance is to promote the well-being of the poor and to find ways to
lend more effectively to small and medium firms that have a chance to grow fast.

Delivering a lecture on “Micro-Credit and Financing of Small Business”, at a local hotel in Karachi
today, Prof. Banerjee said that financial access is more important for helping the poor manage poverty
better, than in making them rich. ‘Micro-credit has caused reduction in interest rates by 30% to 60% and
increased the level of savings among the poor, thereby leading to the reduction in poverty’, he observed.

The lecture, organized by the State Bank of Pakistan, was the 18"""" such event held as a part of
Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture series instituted in 1973 in the name of its first Governor, Mr. Zahid
Husain.

Prof. Banerjee laid emphasis on the significance of financial access to the poor. He argued that big
banks disburse loans on the basis of collateral involving a plethora of formalities which, on the one hand,
depresses the volume of credit available to the poor and, on the other, limits the number of borrowers.

Highlighting the importance of ‘transactions costs’, he observed that high cost leads to push up
the interest rate for small borrowers which, in turn, increases their probability to default and, ultimately,
creates a “vicious circle.”

While sharing the experience of different countries, he informed the audience that the micro-
credit has augmented the business expansion in developing countries. Referring to India, South Africa,
Kenya and Sri Lanka, he said that microfinance has increased financial access to bank branches for the
poor, which has resulted in higher level of investment as well as saving rates.

Citing the example of Kenya, he pointed out that access to saving accounts doubled the capital
invested in business whereas an experimental study in Sri Lanka and India, found borrowers to spend a
major part of their borrowing to the durables. While explaining the problems faced by borrowers, he was
of the view that rigidity of microcredit was the key factor behind the low investment.

Referring to the recent developments in phone banking, commitment products, relaxation of
Know Your Customer (KYC), for Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) financing, he observed that these
efforts have been helpful in reduction of overall poverty level in the above mentioned countries.

Mr. Justice (Retired) Nasir Aslam Zahid, the son of (late) Mr. Zahid Husain, the first Governor of
the State Bank of Pakistan who presided over the function, recounted the numerous achievements of his

Kamran Shehzad stresses the need for

constant vigilance for the safety of the
financial system

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that in view
of the critical importance of IT for banking and financial sector, there is a need to exercise constant
vigilance for the safety of the financial system.

Delivering his keynote address at the 7"" International Information Security Conference (InfoSec
2011) at a local hotel in Karachi today, he said that structured, well defined and documented security
policies, standards and guidelines are the cornerstones for good information system security. He said
that each institution is required to define, document, communicate, implement and audit information
security to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and timely availability of information.

He said that the deployment of information technology in financial institutions has helped in
attaining better systemic efficiency while at the same time introduced new areas of risk and threats
apart from the risk inherent in the traditional banking and financial activities.

‘The survival and growth of financial institutions and business largely depend on the security
infrastructure deployed by them for ensuring the accessibility, quality, adequacy and integrity of their
information and information systems’, he added.

Mr. Kamran said: ‘The need for tighter and vigilant information security controls assumes
greater important in view of the prevalent security environment of the country. We cannot afford to be
complacent in exercising rigorous risk management protocols in today’s fast paced technology-based
business environment and banking without strong security architecture, effective disaster recovery and
business continuity plans as these can have severe consequences for a business’.

The SBP Deputy Governor said that the security procedures for protection of information
resources will require the identification and assessment of risks and the development of proper controls
to offset and reduce potential threats.

Mr. Kamran Shehzad said that a small network interruption or data error can cause huge losses
for a business apart from the loss of reputation and trust of the customers. ‘Therefore, financial
institutions engaging in any form of e-banking should have effective and reliable methods to protect
their information and their customers from data loss and identity thefts,’ he said.

SBP Deputy Governor emphasized that financial institutions should address, among others, the
security issues related to unauthorized access to information & information systems, loss/
modifications/ manipulations of data, loss of confidential information, problems inherent in an open

Shahid Kardar stresses upon coordinated response to
changing macroeconomic environment

Mr. Shahid H. Kardar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the future strategy
to control inflation must include coordinated and timely response to changing macroeconomic
conditions along with a concerted effort to raise the productive capacity of the economy.

Addressing members of the business community at the Federation of Pakistan
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Karachi today, Mr. Kardar stressed that any
delay in implementing such a strategy would only make the policy trade-offs much more
difficult resulting in continuing uncertainty regarding desirable economic outcomes.

Responding to various queries regarding Monetary Policy, SBP Governor said that
Monetary Policy has played its part in correcting the macroeconomic imbalances, but other
government policies have not been that supportive. “Had the SBP not responded, the inflation
outlook and reserve position of the country would have been worse,” he added.

Mr. Kardar explained that the growth in broad money and thus inflation would have
been much higher if the private sector had also continued to borrow unchecked from the
banking system along with the public sector. He said some observers can comment that
availability of cheap credit to the private sector would have supplemented productive capacity,
helping reduce the output gap but given the deterioration in the law and order conditions and
energy sector problems in the last three years, it is highly unlikely that investments in the
country, by both local and foreign investors, would have grown rapidly.

“Thus in any case, rising inflation would have made the businesses uncompetitive by
increasing the cost of production,” he said and explained that what we have learned about the
dynamics of inflation in Pakistan is that in broad terms, inflationary pressures have been a mix
of upward adjustments in administrated prices, a persistence of output gap and inconsistent
macroeconomic policies negatively influencing expectations of inflation.

Mr. Kardar said that in cumulative terms, Pakistan’s economy has experienced an
inflation of 66 percent between June 2007 and October 2010. “This is almost twice the level of
inflation seen during June 2003 and June 2007, which was 36 percent,” he added.

He said that the credit extended for ‘commodity operations’, including both wheat and
sugar, grew by 288 percent during the last three years compared to 33 percent in the three
years before that. “Borrowings of this scale would not have been possible without an upward
pressure on market interest rates,” he said and added that the borrowing of government
agencies for financing its wheat, urea, and sugar trading operations was Rs 382 billion at just

Corporate sector must strengthen institutional mechanism
for pooling philanthropic contributions: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has stressed upon the
corporate sector to further build the institutional mechanism for pooling philanthropic
contributions from individuals and corporations to address the social issues on a greater scale.

Speaking as a Chief Guest at a ceremony for distribution of Pakistan Corporate
Philanthropy Awards and launching of Corporate Philanthropy Report 2010 at a local hotel in
Karachi this afternoon, he observed that these efforts would feed into the overall competitive
context of the corporate sector, enabling the companies to leverage the efforts and
infrastructure for the development of the nation.

‘| would urge the corporate sector to move the narrow focus of Corporate Philanthropy
(CP) from a public relations tool to a vehicle for creating social value for long term impact, he
said, adding that the institutions must adopt a strategic approach to CP programs. ‘CP programs
must be well structured in terms of striking a balance between business needs and the
community’s preferences with a high focus on leveraging and harmonizing for scale,’ he
emphasized.

Mr. Anwar said that institutions must adopt CP focus and communication strategy, such
as through their annual reports and websites to give CP initiatives greater visibility among the
internal and external stakeholders. Besides, the institutions also need to put in place verifiable
criteria for measuring and monitoring achievements of CP initiatives. ‘The criteria must
measure the impact on both dimensions of business performance and society’s well-being,’ he
added.

SBP Governor also stressed the need to develop a business case for CP initiatives. ‘The
business case may be developed on fundamentals such as strengthening corporate legitimacy
and reputation, building competitive advantage, and creating win-win situations through
synergistic value creation,’ he said, adding that the CP must seek partnerships to create
synergies with other philanthropists for scale and sustainability and long term impact on social
indicators.

He said that according to the UNDP’s Human Development Report 2011, Pakistan is
among countries with the lowest human development program. The report places national
multidimensional poverty, which is a composite of several social indicators including health,
education and standard of living, at 49.4 percent of the population, he said, adding that given
this high level of social and economic deprivation, the corporate sector must rise to shoulder
the burden of development with the government.

Electronic Banking transactions jump 19% to
Rs 12 trillion in 2"""" half of FY11: SBP Report

The value of e-Banking transactions aggregated to Rs 12 trillion during the second half of
FY11 showing an increase of 19.0 percent as compared to the first half of the year, says State
Bank of Pakistan’s Payment Systems Half Yearly Review released today.

The volume of such transactions during the period under review reached 125.9 million
depicting an increase of 15.5 percent as compared to the first half of FY11, the Review said,
adding that the payment system infrastructure in Pakistan has maintained an overall growth
trend for the second half of FY11.

The Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), which are the largest channel of e-Banking
transactions, showed 16.5 percent increase in number of transactions and 19.0 percent
increase in value raising the share of ATM transactions in total e-Banking transactions to 58.8
percent and 5.4 percent respectively, the Review said, adding that the number of Real-Time
Online Branches (RTOB) transactions grew by 14.7 percent and the value of transactions
increased by 18.8 percent as compared to first half of FY11. ‘These transactions contributed
31.6 percent in total volume of e-Banking and 93.2 percent in the value of such transactions
respectively,’ the Review observed.

According to the Review, as many as 466 more Automated Teller Machines were added
in the system bringing the total number of ATMs in the country to 5,200 while 380 more bank
branches were converted into Real Time Online Branches (RTOBs). ‘A total of 7,416 bank
branches (78%) are now offering real time online banking out of a total of 9,541 branches in
the country. The number of plastic cards at 14 million also registered an increase of 6.2 per

It said that the total number of POS terminals at 37,232 depicted a decline of 16 per
cent as compared to 44,383 terminals in the first half of FY11. ‘This decline in the number of
POS terminals is due to business considerations in terms of which investment in ATMs was
considered a more viable strategic option. The volume of POS transactions in the country

Yaseen Anwar stresses the need for the development of robust
Shariah compliant risk management infrastructure in Pakistan

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed the need for
the development of a robust Shariah compliant risk management infrastructure in Pakistan’s
Islamic banking industry that will enable both the Islamic banks and their clients to mitigate
genuine business risks.

Inaugurating a workshop on ‘Hedging in Islamic Finance and Master Hedging
Agreement,’ which was organized by International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM) in
collaboration with the State Bank of Pakistan in Karachi today, Mr. Anwar said that while
conventional banks have access to a variety of sophisticated risk management and hedging
instruments, there has been a dearth of Shariah compliant hedging products in the country for
mitigating risks arising out of genuine business transactions that put Islamic Banking Institutions
(IBIs) at a disadvantageous position viz a viz their conventional counterparts.

Describing the pace of growth and development of the Islamic banking industry in
Pakistan as encouraging, he said that at present it constitutes over 7 percent of the country’s
banking system. Given the healthy growth for the past several years, the enabling regulatory
and Shariah compliance framework, the growing HR capacity of IBIs and increasing awareness
of the masses about Islamic banking, the share of the industry is likely to increase manifold in
the future, he added.

Mr. Anwar, however, observed that despite these positive developments and trends, we
need not be complacent as the industry still faces numerous challenges, including development
of a robust Shariah compliant risk management infrastructure. ‘Moreover, the absence of
standardized documentation invariably results in significantly higher transaction costs thus
making the transaction unviable,’ he added.

SBP Deputy Governor noted that notwithstanding the dire need of Shariah compliant
risk management and hedging instruments for Islamic banks, it should be explicitly understood
that such instruments should cover/hedge the genuine risks arising due to real business and
economic transactions and should in no way allow transactions for speculative motives. ‘I
presume, the same is the spirit of the Tahawwut (Hedging) Master Agreement (TMA). This
workshop, | believe, will enable our Islamic banking industry to better understand the
objectives, the underlying transactions and legal documentation etc suggested in the TMA,’ he
said, adding that it will also enable our market to develop and offer Shariah compliant hedging
instruments.

State Bank developing comprehensive liquidity
management solution for IBIs: SBP Governor

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has disclosed that the central bank
is currently at an advanced level of development of a comprehensive liquidity management solution
for Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) following extensive efforts made both by the industry and the
SBP.

Delivering his keynote address at a two-day international conference — Oman Islamic
Economic Forum — in Muscat, he said that this comprehensive liquidity management solution would
include i) development of Islamic interbank money market, ii) development of Islamic Interbank
Offered Rate (IIBOR) for use as a benchmark for pricing of Islamic finance products, iii)
transformation of a sizeable portion of conventional sovereign debt in the books of central bank
into Shariah-compliant debt, iv) allowing IBIls to place surplus liquidity with the central bank to be
remunerated based on the central bank’s earnings on Shariah-complaint assets and investment
portfolio, and v) lender of last resort facility for IBls.

The most challenging and time consuming aspect of this mechanism is the transformation of
sovereign debt into Shariah-complaint debt as it involves identification of the assets to be used for
transformation, their valuation and documentation etc, he said. ‘However, | am confident that with
the help and grace of Almighty Allah, we should be able to finalize this mechanism in the near
future. This would be a major milestone and would give a big boost to the already buoyant Islamic
finance industry in Pakistan,’ he added.

SBP Governor emphasized that innovation remains the corner stone of Islamic banking. ‘IBIs
need to increase their product mix in order to meet the needs of their ever increasing client base.
Research and development which has been long ignored in our part of the world should be the hall
mark of IBls,’ he said, adding that we need to change our perceptions and invest in research as a
core ingredient of our strategic objectives.

Mr. Anwar said that there is huge potential for development of Shariah based agriculture
financing in Pakistan being an agro-based economy. ‘The central bank is working with the industry
to develop Shariah-compliant agriculture finance products to be offered by IBls after necessary
customization. We have recently circulated a model Shariah-compliant agriculture finance product
based on ‘Salam’ to facilitate IBls’ entry in the country’s agri-finance markets, which so far have
remained grossly un-served or under served,’ he added.

He said that the Islamic economic system is not just about prohibition of interest, it also
promotes values such as accountability, transparency and social responsibility. ‘We in Pakistan
adopted an evolutionary approach for establishing Islamic finance in the country in 2001 whereby
both conventional and Islamic banks were allowed to operate in parallel. This enabled the masses
to choose between the two systems that best serves their banking and financial services needs and
is also in conformity with their faith,’ he said, adding that the approach has worked well since then
and the industry starting from almost scratch in 2001, has gradually improved its share to more
than 7.5 percent of the country’s banking system.

New law will restructure entire national
statistical system of Pakistan: Asif Bajwa

The Secretary, Statistics Division, Government of Pakistan, Mr. Asif Bajwa today said
that a new statistical law has been proposed to restructure the entire national statistical system
(NSS) of Pakistan.

Inaugurating a one-day Seminar on “Contributions and Achievements of Official
Statistics” at SBP Learning Resource Centre in Karachi this morning, he said that with the
adoption of this law by the Parliament, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics will be established with the
merger of Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS), Population Census Organization (PCO) and
Agriculture Census Organization (ACO).

He said that a National Statistics Development Strategy (NSDS) is being developed to
provide a strategy for strengthening statistical capacity across the entire national statistical
system (NSS). Quarterly National Accounts (QNA) which is an international obligation, is in its
final stage and the 1* QNA will be released probably in the first quarter of the new financial
year, he added.

He disclosed that a new Statistics Research and Training Institute (SRTI) will be
established in Lahore to train the officials of statistical organizations. Mr. Bajwa said that
Census 2011 has been initiated and house listing will be carried out in April 2011 and
enumeration will start from September this year. He expressed the hope that Pakistan will
qualify for IMF Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) during the current calendar year.

Mr. Bajwa also expressed the hope that the seminar will increase awareness of the
importance of good statistics and will lead towards enhanced cooperation and building trust on
the statistics generated by the statistical organizations.

Earlier, in his welcome address, Mr. Riaz Riazuddin, Chief Economic Advisor, State Bank

statistics. He however, emphasized that the quality of statistics can only be improved through
collaboration among the data producing agencies and other stakeholders. ‘The state of a

added.

New Microfinance Strategic Framework to promote
financial inclusion in Pakistan: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan today said the central bank has laid
down a detailed strategy to promote sustainable growth of the microfinance sector in its new
Microfinance Strategic Framework 2011-15, which will foster a pro-poor and sustainable
development in the country.

In his inaugural speech at the 5"" Pakistan Microfinance Country Forum at a local hotel in
Karachi this morning, he said that the strategy’s effectiveness and success hinges on growth
dynamism fundamentally coming from microfinance operators themselves. The State Bank will
continue to work with all stakeholders, in order to support this nascent industry, which is
expected to be a key driver in expanding financial services to all over Pakistan’, he added.

He said that the role of SBP is to develop the banking infrastructure, encourage the use
of successful global practices, and provide the regulatory and supervisory mechanism to enable
Microfinance Banks (MFBs) to develop viable business models. ‘SBP will issue regulatory
guidelines to MFBs for up-scaling of loans, and develop a reporting structure to assess the
geographic distribution of microfinance growth,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said that the success of microfinance in Pakistan has widely been
acknowledged by the international community. ‘Our microfinance regulatory framework has
been ranked globally at the top in 2010 and 2011 by the independent “the Economic
Intelligence Unit” an arm of UK’s ‘The Economist’ magazine, he added. The evolution or
trajectory of microfinance has so far remained positive despite many challenges, he said,
adding that presently, nine MFBs are operating in Pakistan.

SBP Governor said that the recent development in mobile phone banking is highly
encouraging. The expansion in the retail network of microfinance has been brought about
overwhelmingly from agents and mobile phone channels, he said and added that within a span
of just two years, there are now almost 18,000 branchless banking outlets surpassing the
10,000 conventional bank branches.

He said the combined daily transaction volume of the two prominent branchless
banking models ‘Easypaisa’ and ‘Omni’ now averages over 175,000, with an average size of Rs
3,700. As per an independent World Bank - CGAP study, the small size of the transaction
indicates enhanced access to finance by the poor and the marginalized unbanked people, an
important milestone for financial inclusion, he added.

Mr. Anwar lauded the role of UKAid and Asian Development Bank in the development of
microfinance in Pakistan and said that under the programs sponsored by these donors, a
number of market interventions are managed by the State Bank of Pakistan.

SBP, IFC study to help Increase Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member
of the World Bank Group, have launched a series of publications to help Pakistani banking sector
expand access to finance for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that drive job creation and
growth in the country.

SBP and IFC have produced a series of booklets about the ways banks can increase lending to
small and medium enterprises. These booklets, which cover ten sectors including agriculture,
education and logistics, are aimed at helping the banks in creating better and low-cost product
programs that will enable small businesses to obtain more financing and expand their operations.

These booklets (available at http://www.sbp.org.pk/departments/ihfd-ifc.htm) follow a
study conducted by SBP and IFC in Pakistan that included the participation of top 16 commercial
banks and over 300 interviews of small businesses in 10 sectors. Each booklet includes an industry
overview and chapters on market assessment, risk assessment, financial benchmarking, proposed
banking products for the sector, and guidance on how these products could be channeled and
distributed.

 

At the completion of the survey, SBP and IFC held a dissemination workshop for banks at
Karachi wherein the surveying consultants shared key features and findings of the Project with the
participating banks.

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar, who presided over the
workshop, while stressing the importance and significance of the exercise emphasized upon the
banks to make maximum use of the findings of the survey. He also stressed upon the banks that
while defining their competitive positioning and designing profitable SME strategies, they should
provide better and improved services to the SMEs.

Mr. Kaiser Naseem, IFC’s Head of Bank Advisory Services for Middle East & North
America (MENA), said: “IFC works to help small businesses obtain financing to grow and create
jobs. Our work in Pakistan will encourage banks to lend money to new markets, encouraging
economic growth.”

Such workshops will also be held in other important SME centres of the country, in order to

disseminate the Study’s findings to a larger group of stakeholders, especially the finance providers.

Shahid Kardar advises new generation of Pakistan
to take risk and ‘make your mark’ in society

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Shahid H. Kardar has advised the new
generation of Pakistan to take risk, be an outlier and ‘make your mark’ in society.

Speaking at the Convocation of the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)
today, he observed that those who have a fire in their belly and the urge and determination to
pursue their dreams and take on the world rather than simply play safe would be the great
achievers.

‘However, whichever path you choose to traverse, remember, in this highly competitive
age of specialization you can take up any profession and be a success, provided you are the best
at it. There is always room at the top — at the bottom you get trampled over’, he told the LUMS
graduates.

Mr. Kardar opined that outliers change society and history, and often for the better.
‘Yes, not all of you can become outliers, but some of you will. It takes the strength of one’s
conviction to veer away from the beaten path and explore; and when you explore something
new, you learn much more,’ he added.

He advised the graduating students of LUMS: ‘Do not be daunted by risk or the fear of
failure — it is better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at all. And do not become
jaded like people of my generation — instead, be optimistic and challenge conventional
thinking.’ He noted that finance/capital was not a constraint. ‘It is the limitations of our
imagination and willingness to take a risk. Of course, you need a lucky break but a brilliant idea
will invariably get one’, the SBP Governor added.

Mr. Kardar observed: ‘It is a special breed of people that voluntarily takes risk. And let
me be honest, | always have time for risk takers because | gain so much from engaging with
them. It makes perfect sense, these people are outliers; their experience and mindset are very
different from most of us.’

‘Such a career will not be easy to launch as you may end up following many dead leads;
you will have to do a lot of leg-work, and there is no guaranteed reward; you will not have the
luxury of going into the same office every morning, but will have to explore a new path every
day. It might sound positively intimidating but this can be the difference between living a life

Financial sector should play its role in resolving

energy crisis in the country: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed upon the
financial sector to play its due role in resolving the ongoing energy crisis in the country,
which is hampering both the business activities and the life of the common man. ‘An early
resolution of this critical issue is in the interest of all, including the banking industry itself,’
he added.

Presiding over a meeting of the Chief Executives of banks at SBP, Karachi convened
for resolving the problems being faced by Independent Power Projects (IPPs), Mr. Anwar
assured the banks that the State Bank would facilitate them in case they require any
regulatory support towards early resolution of the circular debt crisis.

He pointed out that the Prime Minister’s high-powered committee is focusing on
remedial steps to develop a long term solution of the energy crisis. Mr. Anwar, however,
emphasized that a quick remedy is sought to overcome the immediate financial
requirement.

It may be recalled that the Prime Minister recently constituted a high level
committee for resolution of energy-related issues facing the country of which the Acting
Governor, SBP, Mr. Yaseen Anwar is a member.

Mr. Abdullah Yusuf Chairman, Independent Power Producers Advisory Council and
the representatives of IPPs briefed the meeting about the severity of the issue and
identified the factors behind the crisis. They informed the meeting that Government of
Pakistan (GoP) is considering various short and medium term options for resolution of the
energy crises faced by the country on a sustainable basis, which include possibilities like use
of coal as a substitute to oil, import of gas as raw material and the construction of small
hydel power projects.

During the discussions, it was emphasized that the issues being faced by the IPPs are
primarily driven by the paucity of short-term liquidity. A number of proposals were also
presented to the banks for addressing the issues including allocation of working capital
limits to PEPCO, extension of L/C time period from 60 days to 90 days for the IPPs and the
conversion of outstanding circular debt into long term Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).

While appreciating the sincerity of the GoP in early resolution of the issue, the banks
suggested that the GoP should first focus on resolution of its direct circular debt of Rs 300
billion through issuance of PIBs on priority basis, whereas financing to individual IPPs
(existing and incremental) would be taken care of by the banks individually on case-to-case
basis. They also proposed that the GoP may look into the possibility of incremental financing
through PIBs, which is considered to be more viable and would help distribute the
responsibility for financing to a larger number of banks/development finance institutions
(DFls).

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has advised all banks to meticulously comply with its
guidelines and instructions regarding management of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
operations in order to ensure continuous availability of ATM service during the Holy Month of
Ramazan and Eid-ul Fitr holidays.

Heavy penalties under the relevant laws would be imposed on those banks, which fail to
comply with the guidelines and instructions regarding management of ATM operations and
monitoring of ATM cash/downtime during Ramazan and Eid holidays issued by the State Bank

cause ATM malfunctioning or cash outage incidents, besides introducing a 24/7 helpline to
resolve the day-to-day operational issues at ATMs. The helpline should also be accessible
through special phone terminals placed inside all ATM booths/cabins. Banks are required to
ensure that these phones are in working order. The helpline numbers should also be widely
publicized for the customers’ awareness so that they may inquire or timely register their
complaints as per their convenience.

Branchless banking shows impressive
growth in first quarter of FY12

Branchless banking in Pakistan has shown an impressive growth in the first quarter of
the current fiscal year (FY12) according to the latest SBP publication: ‘Branchless Banking
News’ posted on its website ( www.sbp.org.pk) today.

According to the publication, branchless banking would prove a game-changer in
improving access of unbanked population to financial services in Pakistan. The total number of
active branchless banking agents reached to 17,448 in a short span of two years whereas
number of branches of all commercial banks is almost 10,000. The total number of active
branchless banking accounts increased by 51.23 percent to 357,598, total branchless banking
deposits by 28.03 percent to Rs 187 million, number of transactions by 26.93 percent to 15.867
million and the volume of transactions by 43.20 percent to Rs 58,710 million during the July-
September, 2011 quarter.

The average size of branchless banking transaction is Rs 3,700 while the average number
of transaction per day is 176,296 in the first quarter of FY12, showing evidence of the access of
these services to poor and low-income group. Almost half of its users did not have a bank
account and almost two-thirds used the service regularly. These results hint at the considerable
un-met demand for efficient, low cost and accessible financial services.

Pakistan has huge potential in the area of branchless banking as mobile phone banking
has successfully emerged in Pakistan after the issuance of branchless banking regulations in
March, 2008.

The early success of mobile banking in Pakistan is attributable to the collaborative
efforts of a wide range of stakeholders, including Government, regulatory authorities,
development agencies, NADRA, telecom operators, financial institutions, and technology firms.

The innovative branchless banking models have been penetrating in areas of massive
payments such as utility bills, Government-to-persons, persons-to-persons payments while
poising for scaling up for other services relating to deposits and loans.

The branchless banking models are witnessing growth but they are still in early-phase
experimentation, requiring understanding of critical issues and taking measures to expand
retail networks and leverage technologies. Once these models reach to a degree of maturity,
the inter-operability will come in to facilitate customers to send money to anyone with account
at any bank, and do cash-in and cash-out with agent of any bank. Getting to this ultimate stage
will be both exciting and challenging.

form and copy of customer’s CNIC to the Financial Institution (Fl) for further processing, the
branchless banking agents have been allowed to send the Digital Account Opening form,
customer’s digital photo and an image of customer’s CNIC to the FI electronically.

The new category of Level ‘0’ BB Account will provide flexibility to the Agent and the
Financial Institution (Fl) for opening of basic BB accounts while rationalizing the ‘Know Your
Customer (KYC)’ requirements in line with the transaction limits.

The following transaction and maximum balance limits on Level “O” Accounts shall be
applicable: Daily Limit Rs. 15,000, Monthly Limit Rs. 25,000, Annual Limit Rs. 120,000 and
Maximum Balance Limit Rs. 100,000.

Similarly, the transaction limits of Level 1 Branchless Banking Accounts have been
reasonably increased to cater to the needs of the customers by rationalizing the Know Your
Customer (KYC) requirements. Now, all services permissible under existing Branchless Banking
Regulations shall be available to Level “1” account holders.

The transaction and maximum balance limits applicable to Level “1” Accounts will be:
Daily Limit Rs. 25,000 (previous limit was Rs 10,000), Monthly Limit Rs. 60,000 (previous limit
was Rs 20,000) and Annual Limit Rs.500,000 (previous limit was Rs. 120,000). There will be no
Maximum Balance Limit, according to the amendments.

for opening & maintenance of savings accounts

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to prohibit all the banks from levying any service
charges for opening and maintenance of regular savings accounts with effect from July 01,
2011.

‘The services rendered by banks for the opening and maintenance of regular savings
accounts shall be free of charge. There shall be no condition of maintaining a minimum balance
for these accounts. These instructions are applicable equally on all existing and new accounts.
Similarly, no charges would be recovered by banks at the time of closing an account’, says BPRD
Circular No.07 of May 27, 2011.

Banks shall not demand more than Rs. 100/- as an initial amount for opening of regular
savings accounts. However, no initial deposit would be required for opening of accounts by (i)
Mustahkeen of Zakat, (ii) Students, (iii) Employees of Government or Semi Government
institutions for salary and pension purposes (including widows/children of deceased employees
eligible for family pension/benevolent fund grant, etc.) and other similar types of accounts, the
Circular said.

It added that the banks shall ensure that all terms and conditions for the operation of an
account, especially in case of its dormancy, closing and/or subsequent reactivation are brought
into the knowledge of the customer at the time of account opening. The terms and conditions
shall be clearly documented in the Account Opening Form/Application and must be signed by
the account holders, to signify that they have been read and understood. A copy of the Account
Opening Form must be provided to the account holders duly verified by the authorized
official(s) of the branch with proper record of acknowledgement. Any ambiguity in the terms
and conditions mentioned in the Account Opening Form shall be construed to be in favor of the
account holders.

Key features of the Account Opening Form shall be translated into Urdu and a printed
copy of such translation shall be shared with the account holders at the time of opening of the
account, the Circular said and added that the banks shall not refuse opening of accounts for
prospective clients who meet the requirements laid out in the Prudential Regulations, other
instructions issued by SBP from time to time and banks’ own policies. Moreover, the banks shall
pay profit invariably on “Profit and Loss Sharing (PLS) Accounts” without any condition of
minimum balance in accordance with instructions issued by SBP from time to time.

Islamic banking industry constitutes 7.3 percent of
overall banking system in Pakistan: Kamran Shehzad

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said
that the Islamic banking industry at present constitutes about 7.3% of the overall banking
system in Pakistan.

Addressing the closing ceremony of a five-day Training Program on Islamic Banking
which was jointly organized by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and Islamic Research and Training
Institute (IRTI) at the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), Islamabad today, he
said the Islamic banking industry since its re-launch in 2001 has gradually increased its share in
the market.

He said that there are 5 full-fledged Islamic banks and 12 conventional banks having
Islamic banking branches with a network over 840 branches in more than 70 districts across the
country. He noted that the Islamic banking industry has maintained strong growth momentum
with over 30 percent average annual growth during the last 6-7 years.

The Deputy Governor observed that the growth trend in Islamic banking industry is
likely to gather further momentum with increasing awareness level and expansion of Islamic
banking network in second and third tier cities of the country.

Mr. Kamran Shehzad said that the strong growth momentum witnessed by the industry
in Pakistan could be attributed, among others, to the key role played by the State Bank of
Pakistan in providing an enabling environment. ‘The State Bank has been at the forefront of
almost all the initiatives that have been taken to help develop and promote the industry’ he
added.

Besides developing a supportive regulatory and supervisory framework, the SBP is
actively engaged in promotion and training and capacity building of the Islamic banking
industry, he said. ‘To address the awareness and misconception issues, we have launched an
awareness campaign whereby targeted seminars and conferences are being organized for
business community, academia, bankers and policy makers throughout the country. Further, a
media campaign is being launched for mass awareness using electronic and print media, he
added.

The Deputy Governor said that a number of initiatives have been taken to build the
industry’s HR capacity and skills mix. The financial and technical support of reputed national
and international institution like IRTI, Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) are also being
mobilized to organize training and capacity building programs, he said. Our membership and

Life in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Federally and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas.

STATE BANK LEAVES POLICY RATE
UNCHANGED AT 12 PERCENT

The Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan at its meeting held under the
Chairmanship of SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today has decided to keep the policy rate
unchanged at 12 percent after thoroughly considering the need to revive growth and emerging risks to
macroeconomic stability.

‘To promote competition in the banking system and to offer alternative sources of savings to the
population, SBP has been encouraging depositors to invest in government securities through Investor’s
Portfolio Securities (IPS) accounts,’ the State Bank of Pakistan said in its Monetary Policy Decision.

It said the option of maintaining saving deposits or investments in IPS accounts could provide
stiff competition to banks forcing them to offer better returns on deposits. ‘This in turn would
incentivize savings and help lower the currency in circulation,’ it added.

Moreover, it will improve the transmission of monetary policy changes to market interest rates,
SBP’s Monetary Policy Decision said, adding that over time this strategy would also diversify the
government’s funding source, deepen the secondary market of government securities, and facilitate the
issuance of corporate debt.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

“The SBP reduced its policy rate by 200 bps, to 12 percent, in FY12 so far. The objective of
adopting this stance is to support revival of private investment in the economy despite a constraining
domestic and global economic environment. The primary factors in support of this stance were the
expectation of average CPI inflation remaining within the announced target in FY12 and a small
projected external current account deficit. In pursuing this stance SBP did acknowledge the risks to
macroeconomic stability emanating from fiscal weaknesses and falling foreign financial inflows. These
include resurgence of medium term inflationary pressures and challenges SBP is facing in managing
market liquidity and preserving foreign exchange reserves.

A reassessment of latest developments and projections indicate that macroeconomic risks have
somewhat increased during the last two months. For instance, although the year-on-year CPI inflation
stands at 11 percent in October 2011, the month-on-month inflation trends, averaging at around 1.3
percent per month during the first four months of FY12, show existence of inflationary pressures. The
sifting of commodity level CPI data reveal that the number of CPI items exhibiting year-on-year inflation
of more than 10 percent is consistently increasing and almost all of these items belong to the non-food
category. The government has also increased its wheat support price by Rs100 to Rs1050 per 40kg for
the next wheat procurement season.

Thus, while the average inflation may settle around the targeted 12 percent for FY12, it is
uncertain that inflation will come down to a single digit level in FY13. The main determinants of this
inflation behaviour are government borrowing from the banking system and inertial effects of high

Licensing Policy to allow menu of options to banks for expanding their outreach to all nooks and
corners of the country; the incentive build in the policy aimed at expanding financial services to
unbanked and rural areas.

‘The policy allows opening of branches for conventional banking services as well as
segments specific branches like microfinance services, Islamic banking branches and smaller
limited service banking set ups like sub-branches and permanent booths,’ he said, adding that
banking rules and regulations have been so designed in order to provide an even playing field to
all banks.

result, Branchless Banking is expanding steadily with the increasing participation of stronger as

branches (out of total seventy-eight business places)’, he added.

Islamic Banking Institutions can accept Utility Bills after due date

The Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) can collect / accept utility bills after the due date with

“Karahiat” (displeasure), according to Shariah Scholars.

It may be pointed out that in terms of instructions contained in BPRD Circular No. 3 of 2006,
read with BPRD Circular No 38 of 1997 and other relevant instructions issued from time to time, all
branches of scheduled commercial banks including Islamic banks are required to collect utility bills from
their customers. However, it was observed that some Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) refuse to accept
payment of bills after the due date as the late payment includes a penalty which in their opinion is Riba

and thus cannot be collected by them.

The matter was discussed with the Shariah Advisors of all IBIs at the Shariah Advisors’ Forum
and the SBP Shariah Board. The Shariah Scholars opined that keeping in view the larger public interest
and convenience, the IBIs can collect /accept utility bills after the due date with ‘Karahiat’ (»!S)

(displeasure), according to IBD Circular Letter No. 1 of July 8, 2011.

IBIs are, therefore, advised to strictly comply with SBP’s prevalent instructions on collection of

utility bills within and after the due date at their branches, the Circular Letter added.

SBP develops Sharia compliant model product to
meet working capital needs of farming community

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has developed a model product based on “Salam” to
meet the production finance (working capital) needs of country’s farming community. The
model product developed, in consultation with all the stakeholders will facilitate Islamic
Banking Institutions (IBIs) in improving the access of agricultural Islamic financing to the farming
community.

The product covers the Sharia related aspects as well as business cycle and financing
requirements of farm/ crop production activities, says AC&MFD Circular No. 3 of October 18,
2011.

The product based on ‘‘Salam”’ i.e. sale of agri. produce against full payment in advance
but deferred delivery on a specified future date, will give necessary flexibility to the farmers to
use the funds to meet farming input requirements.

IBIs may adopt the model product in the present form or with some adjustments to suit
their organizational & operational needs and market characteristics, subject to compliance with
SBP regulations and approval from their Shariah Advisors, the circular added.

IBIs have been advised to ensure that their relevant staff possesses the requisite
knowledge and expertise about the product, the circular said, adding that they should also
launch awareness campaigns through electronic & print media, seminars, workshops, etc to
ensure that their clients/ farmers are fully educated about the product and familiar with the
requirements like documentation, loan limit, process flow/ procedure, etc.

According to the model product, the farmers at their discretion may enter into single or
multiple ‘Salam’ transactions based on their specific funding needs. Under single ‘Salam’ the
total funds needed by the farmer will be disbursed/credited to the farmer’s account in lump
sum.

Whereas, under the multiple ‘Salam’ transactions the funds would be disbursed in
tranches as and when needed by the farmer by executing various/multiple ‘Salam’. However,
the farmer would have the option to choose the single or multiple ‘Salam’ depending upon
his/her convenience and preference.

All farmers/tenants/growers involved in raising crops are eligible to get financing from
Islamic Banking Institutions (IBls) under the scheme (‘Salam’). The maximum financing to be
extended to the farmer could be 1-3 years average market value of the produce being

PRI wins international Money Transfer Award 2011

Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) has been awarded the Money Transfer Award
2011 for the category of ‘Asia Pacific including South Asia’ by the International Association
of Money Transfer Networks (IAMTN). This special award recognized the efforts of State
Bank of Pakistan to deliver an innovative and effective initiative.

The results of this year's IAMTN Annual Money Transfer Awards were announced at
a special ceremony during the Global Money Transfers Summit - 2011 (GMTS - 2011) that
took place in London recently.

Money Transfer Award 2011 was conferred in recognition to the efforts being made
by PRI to facilitate the flow of remittances through formal channels into Pakistan. The
Award was announced by Leon Isaacs, Managing Director-IAMTN, and presented by
Veronica Studsgaard, CEO-IAMTN.

It may be pointed out here that in order to provide an ownership structure in
Pakistan for remittance facilitation, Government of Pakistan through State Bank of Pakistan,
Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Ministry of Finance had launched a joint initiative called
Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) in April 2009. This initiative has been taken to achieve
the objective of facilitating & supporting faster, cheaper, convenient and efficient flow of
remittances.

Since its inception, PRI has taken a number of steps to enhance the flow of
remittances through formal channels which include: (a) preparation of national strategies
on remittances (b) taking all necessary steps to implement the overall strategy (c) playing
the advisory role for financial sector in terms of preparing a business case, relationship
building with overseas correspondents, creating separate efficient remittance payment
highways and (d) becoming a national focal point for overseas Pakistanis through round the
clock call centre with toll free lines, separate web site etc.

The workers’ remittances stood at $6.4 billion in FY08 and went up to $7.6 billion in
FYO9. The remittances further increased to $8.6 billion in FY10 and again surged to $11.2
billion in FY11. This rising trend in workers’ remittances also continues in FY12 as $4.3 billion
have been received in Pakistan in first four months of FY12 depicting a growth of over 23%
when compared with corresponding period in FY11. The impressive growth in workers’
remittances is the result of the efforts made by PRI in collaboration with other stakeholders
to facilitate both Overseas Pakistanis and their families back home.

It may be added here that IAMTN is the only non-profitable organization which
represents the Money Transfer industry across the globe and works with regional money

transfer trade bodies.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has extended the limits sanctioned by banks to
individual exporters under Part-ll of the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) /Islamic Export Refinance

It may be pointed out here that export refinance limits sanctioned in favour of banks for

required to submit EE-1 statement for the year 2010-11, duly verified by the Foreign Exchange
Operations Department of SBP-BSC, latest by August 31, 2011. Therefore, banks would not be
in a position to work out revised entitlement of limits for each exporter under Part-II of the
Scheme for the year 2011-12.

In order to ensure that the financing facilities are available to exporters till finalization of

sanctioned by banks to individual exporters shall continue up to August 31, 2011, according to
IH & SMEFD Circular Letter No.10 of June 21, 2011.

The facility under Part-II of Scheme is self regulating and exporters should be able to
evaluate correctly their export earnings during 2010-11, work out their own estimates as to the
quantum of their entitlement for the year 2011-12 and should accordingly adjust their existing
borrowings on or before end June 2011 to avoid utilization of excess facilities under the Scheme
during the period of roll over which would be subject to non refundable fine, the circular letter

Branchless banking is the future of
financial sector: Shahid Kardar

Mr. Shahid H. Kardar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that branchless banking is the future of the
country’s financial sector as it opens up great opportunities for banks to tap into the un-exploited potential by bringing
the unbanked segment of the society into the financial system.

Speaking as the chief guest at a signing ceremony between United Bank Ltd. and ShoreBank International Ltd.
(SBI) to support the UBL’s branchless banking initiative (UBL Omni) at a local hotel in Karachi this afternoon, Mr. Kardar
said the central bank was willing to make regulatory framework for branchless banking more flexible to broaden the
scope of the financial services in line with its Financial Inclusion Strategy.

He said that SBP had been in the fore front in introducing a compact regulatory framework for branchless
banking as Pakistan was one of the few countries in the world where branchless banking took off as a result of the
Branchless Banking Regulations issued by SBP in March 2008. However, Mr. Kardar said that the central bank was open
to ideas and suggestions from the private sector to make this framework more conducive in order to expand the
financial outreach in the country.

“Branchless banking has a huge potential to reach the unbanked and underserved segment of the population,”
he said and added that the branchless banking certainly will help people to take better advantage of the banking
facilities at affordable cost. He said that Pakistan’s financial sector was experiencing a dynamic transition led by the
increasing uptake of branchless banking solutions and this was the new frontier and the only affordable solution for the
financial inclusion. He was of the view that it would be outlandish to regard physical establishment of branches i.e.
bricks and mortar as the way forward to provide financial services to the poor. ‘This transition can be witnessed through
a basic comparison of number of bank branches versus branchless banking outlets,’ he said and added that existing
network of 13,000 branchless banking outlets has already surpassed the total branch network of around 10,000 bank
branches in less than two years.

That there are hundred million mobile phone users in a country in which barely half the population is literate, is
evidence enough that even such disadvantaged sections are adept at using this technology. Therefore, it will only be the
poverty and limitation of our imagination to provide products and services that will be the constraints, given the
versatility of technology and the rapid shrinking of the costs of information and communication technology, SBP
Governor added.

Mr. Kardar pointed that cost of setting up of a conventional banking branch was 76 times higher than using third
party agents to bring the unbanked into the financial system while using mobile phones halves costs further. He stressed
upon the commercial banks to focus and devise new branchless banking products as it would not only help them
improve their market share but also serve a larger portion of the population living in rural and far-flung areas.

Earlier, speaking on the occasion, Mr. Atif R. Bokhari, President of UBL, said: “With SBI’s technical assistance and
the strength of UBL Omni, we aim to support the financial inclusion agenda of the SBP by facilitating the conversion of a
large number of non-bank-account-holders into regular bank-account holders, and to incorporate them within the fold
of documented economy.

Ms. Laurie J. Spengler, President & CEO, SBI, said, “SBI is delighted to be the implementing partner of this
project of national importance for Pakistan.”

State Bank committed to develop country’s
financial sector: Kamran Shehzad

Mr. Muhammad Kamran Shehzad, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said
that SBP is fully committed to continue its relentless efforts for the development of country’s
financial sector.

Speaking at the Flag Hoisting Ceremony held at SBP, Karachi this morning to mark the
64"" Independence Day, he said the achievements of the State Bank are evident from the fact
that now Pakistan is considered among those countries which have a robust financial system.
He said the SBP has been making relentless efforts with sincerity, dedication and honesty for
the development of country’s financial sector.

Congratulating the nation on the Independence Day, he said that 14°"" August is the most
significant day in the history of Pakistan as it reminds us how this great country came into being
after a long and strenuous struggle of our forefathers.

Mr. Kamran said that this day also reminds us of our national heroes whose untiring
efforts, dedication and countless sacrifices gifted us an independent state. ‘We must be
thankful to Almighty Allah, Who bestowed upon us the dynamic leadership of Quaid-e-Azam
Muhammad Ali Jinnah,’ he added.

‘Lam confident that if we rigorously follow our Quaid’s golden principles of Unity, Faith
and Discipline, then no power in the world can stop us from achieving all objectives of the
independence of Pakistan for which our forefathers rendered great sacrifices,’ he stressed.

He said that on August 14, 1947 when we as an independent nation began our journey,
we faced a number of challenges to achieve progress and prosperity for our nation and it
looked like that we would need centuries to overcome these challenges. But, with the blessing
of Almighty Allah and determination of our great nation, we ably succeeded in overcoming
these initial difficulties, he observed.

He pointed out that the State Bank of Pakistan has achieved tremendous progress since
its inception in 1948. Pakistan’s central bank now has a banking system that is capable to
achieve financial stability in accordance with the Quaid’s vision, he said.

Mr. Kamran urged all employees of the central bank to show greater commitment to
transform the State Bank into a more dynamic and modern institution in line with
contemporary banking practices being exercised in the developed economies. “We must renew
our determination that we will continue to make unrelenting efforts to achieve the goals for
which country’s central bank was established. Let’s resolve that we will continue to work with

utmost sincerity, devotion, honesty and professionalism at the central bank,” he added.

No short cuts to sustained economic development: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has said that there are no
shortcuts to sustained economic development. ‘We need to develop the right strategies and
then translate these strategies into action,’ he added.

Delivering his keynote address at the ao"" Management Association of Pakistan (MAP)
Convention on ‘Leadership Challenges for Business Success’ at a local hotel in Karachi this
morning, he said that both our economic and political leadership is faced with multiple
challenges of trade imbalance, inflation, unemployment, power crises and security situation
and added that the challenges for making good decisions on these fronts requires political will
and a clear long term vision.

Mr. Anwar said that similarly the challenges for business leaders, though at a micro
level, are by no means less critical. These challenges range from the survival of businesses in a
stagnant business environment to developing strategies for further growth through developing
new business models, new products or restructuring and re-engineering, he said, adding that
effective leadership must also include skills to manage people and teams. ‘Management of
human resources is extremely critical to the success of any business across the globe,’ he
emphasized.

He underscored the importance of women representation in the work force. ‘Women
represent almost half of the population of Pakistan and a significant talent pool that is ignored,
he said, adding ‘how can we as a nation progress if 50% of our work force is in a non-productive
capacity.’ He also urged the corporate leaders to take into account their corporate social
responsibility so that profit seeking is balanced against the objective of social service and well
being of the society.

Mr. Anwar said the State Bank desires a more active role of the Board of Directors in
setting the strategic direction of a bank as well as to bring it under accountability. He said that
in order to be effective, the concern and tone for risk management must start at the top. ‘You
would agree that while the management may get influenced by business targets and short term
profitability, the Board, representing owner’s perspective, always targets for long term viability
and sustained growth of the bank,’ he observed.

The SBP Governor said that by the virtue of this different perspective and its legal
powers, the Board is better positioned to enhance the role of risk management in a bank. ‘That
is why SBP has always emphasized the involvement of the Board and made it accountable for
establishing enterprise wide risk management framework,’ he added.

Bik te ralC urency Swap Anangem entsygned
between the centalbanks ofPakStan and Turkey

A bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement (CSA) has been signed between State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) in a ceremony
held on 01 November, 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey by Governor SBP Yaseen Anwar and
Governor CBRT Erdem Basc¢i in presence of the President of Pakistan H.E. Asif Ali Zardari
and President of Turkey H.E. Abdullah Gul.

The bilateral CSA has been concluded in Pakistan Rupee / Turkish Lira with size
amounting to US$ 1 billion in equivalent local currencies. Tenor of the agreement will be
for 3 years. Core objective of the Currency Swap Arrangement is to finance bilateral
trade in respective local currencies of the two countries.

This is a ‘Landmark’ transaction executed between the two central banks; and is the
first time either country has executed such an arrangement. We expect that bi-lateral
Trade will grow between Pakistan and Turkey as a result of this agreement, further
augmenting the economic ties of the two countries. This agreement will make a
significant contribution in further strengthening the close and special relationship
between the two countries.

Announcement of the Currency Swap Agreement between the two Central Banks will
give positive signal to the market on the availability of liquidity of the other country's
currency on the onshore market. As a result it will promote bi-lateral trade denominated
in Turkish Lira and PKR.

STATE BANK REDUCES POLICY RATE BY 150 BPS TO 12 PERCENT

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to reduce its policy rate by 150 basis points to
12 percent. This decision was taken at a meeting of the Central Board of Directors of State Bank of
Pakistan held under the Chairmanship of Acting Governor, SBP, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today.

The SBP will continue to monitor developments in the fiscal sector and those pertaining to
foreign financial inflows to gauge risks for macroeconomic stability.

Taking some comfort from declining inflation and high probability of meeting the FY12
inflation target together with a need to support private sector credit and investment growth, the
Central Board of Directors of SBP after due deliberations has decided to reduce its policy rate by 150
bps to 12 percent with effect from 10 October 2011, the State Bank said in its Monetary Policy
Decision.

Following is the text of Monetary Policy Decision:

‘The main factors contributing in SBP’s decision to reduce its policy rate by 50 basis points in
July 2011 continue to show positive progress. There is a decline in CPI inflation and government
borrowing from SBP is lower than its end-June level. Led by consistent inflow of workers’
remittances the external current account position is comfortable though there has been some
decline in SBP’s foreign exchange reserves. Importantly, concerns regarding weak private sector
credit growth and falling real private investment expenditures remain along with a likelihood of rise
in real interest rates.

At the same time, risks to macroeconomic stability emanating from fiscal weaknesses and
falling foreign financial inflows have not receded. Moreover, severe energy crisis and precarious law
and order conditions continue to render domestic economic environment least conducive for
productive activities. In addition, the likelihood of falling short of the annual GDP growth target has
increased due to damaging impact of recent flood in Sindh. The rapidly deteriorating global
economic conditions, especially in Pakistan’s export-destination countries, do not provide much
confidence either. In these circumstances, balancing inflation and growth considerations through
monetary policy alone is difficult.

The year-on-year inflation in September 2011 has come down to 10.5 percent from 13.3
percent in June 2011 though month-on-month inflation is still more than 1 percent on average. An
expected seasonal rise in inflation in the first month of a new fiscal year, the Ramazan seasonality of
food prices, and the unexpected effect of flood on inflation have all coincided in the months of Q1-
FY12. Thus, isolating temporary changes from underlying inflationary pressures is more demanding
at this point in time though the probability of meeting the 12 percent average CPI inflation target for
FY12 remains high. There are upside risks, however, in meeting the medium-term inflation targets of
9.5 percent in FY13 and 8 percent in FY14. These risks largely stem from persistence of government
borrowing from scheduled banks, exchange rate depreciation, and likely upward adjustments in the
administered prices of energy.

Nevertheless, these risks can potentially mitigate if following positive developments and
intended policy actions take root. First, continued restrain on government borrowing from SBP.
According to the provisional data, the outstanding stock of these borrowings (on cash basis) has

SBP asks banks to facilitate general public in exchanging
Rs. 500 old design banknote till September 30, 2011

(MFBs) operating in the country to facilitate the general public in exchanging Rs. 500 old design (bigger
size) banknote within the stipulated deadline of September 30, 2011.

The State Bank of Pakistan/SBP Banking Services Corporation will neither exchange nor be liable
to pay any value of such banknote to any person or a bank after the above mentioned deadline as from
October 1, 2011 the old design Rs. 500 banknote will cease to be a legal tender, says a circular issued by
SBP today.

English & Urdu languages regarding the demonetization and exchange of Rs 500 old design (bigger size)
banknote to SBP Banking Services Corporation and all banks for their placement at prominent visible
places in their field offices and branches as well as at public places. All the banks and 16 field offices of
SBP Banking Services Corporation have been advised to prominently display the dates of demonetization
and acceptability of Rs. 500 old-design (bigger size) banknote at visible places in all their branches.

SBP’s instructions to all banks and other related material in this regard are also available at SBP’s
website. For creating awareness about the demonetization and exchange of Rs. 500 old design (bigger
size) banknote, a media campaign has already been started.

With a view to redressing the public grievances in exchange of Rs 500 old design banknote, SBP
BSC has also established a central Help Desk at its Head Office in Karachi which may be contacted at
telephone numbers: 021-99212491, 021-32455454 & 021-32455470. Complaints may also be lodged at

SBP Governor explains Currency Swap Agreement
with Peoples Bank of China

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar today issued the following
press statement to explain the Currency Swap Agreement with Peoples Bank of China:

‘On December 23, 2011, the undersigned signed a landmark Currency Swap Agreement
(CSA) with the Peoples Bank of China (PBC) in Islamabad in the presence of the Prime
Minister of Pakistan and the State Councilor of the Peoples Republic of China. This
agreement represents a significant achievement for both governments in promoting and
enhancing not only bilateral trade, but also the opportunity to significantly increase
investment in Pakistan going forward.

Given the numerous questions or misconceptions one might have and the potential of not
realizing the significant direct and indirect benefits of this lamdmark agreement, I would like
to highlight the features of the CSA and its modus operandi.

The CSA has been executed for a tenor of 3 years in respective local currencies, Pakistan
Rupee 140 Billion and Chinese Yuan 10 Billion. This is the second Currency Swap
Arrangement that State Bank of Pakistan has signed, the first one being with the Central Bank
of Turkey on November 1, 2011.

While these are strictly bilateral arrangements, the precise terms and conditions of each of
these CSAs are confidential between the two Central Banks; however, a close scrutiny of the
information available in the public domain indicates that the principal objective of these
swaps is to promote the use of regional currencies for trade settlement purposes and
specifically in the case of China, it is to enhance the role of the Chinese Yuan in international
trade and investment. China’s concurrent Yuan local currency settlement program is also
consistent with the underlying currency swap objectives. The latest CSA between Pakistan
and China also reflects similar objectives of promoting trade and investment in bilateral
currencies.

Objectives & Structure of CSA:
The objective of the swap is to 1) promote bilateral trade, 2) finance direct investment

between the two countries in the respective local currencies of the two countries and 3) any
other ‘purpose’ as mutually agreed between the two central banks.

Since the CSA is a bi-lateral financial transaction, all terms & conditions apply equally to
both countries and the pricing is based on standard market benchmarks which are widely
acceptable in the respective domestic markets of the two countries. The following are more
details on the structure of the transaction:

1. Both Central Banks will have the ability to draw on the swap line any time during the
tenor of the swap.

2. SBP can purchase CNY from PBC against its local currency (PKR), and repurchase its
local currency with the same CNY on a predetermined maturity date and exchange rate.
Similarly PBC can also purchase PKR against CNY. Standard market pricing will apply

SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar stresses the need for
development of debt market to spur economic growth

‘Pakistan’s economy and the financial sector are now at a stage where they can support and benefit from
a vibrant and efficient debt market. The size of private debt, or Term Finance Certificates (TFCs) in Pakistan,
remained around Rs 74 billion (0.5% of GDP), which is paltry as compared to the outstanding domestic government
debt of Rs 4.64 trillion (31.4% of GDP). There is clearly underexploited capacity available to support economic
growth.’ This was stated by Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan while delivering his keynote
address on the ‘Role of Financial Institutions and Capital Markets in Pakistan’s Economy’ at PAF Air War College in
Karachi today.

He said that banks continue to be the main provider of debt in the system. ‘In the absence of an active
capital market, the commercial entities fail to procure long term debt financing, and rely on short and medium
term loans from banks. Banks are trying to limit their credit risk and it has become more challenging to raise
private debt for a business,’ he said, adding that while some credit uptake may take place in the future, it is
unlikely that banks will be keen to finance new long term projects anytime soon.

‘We are facing several domestic issues that limit our ability to fully attain our potential. Our financial
institutions and businesses must become more competitive and innovative, regulators like SBP and SECP must
actively facilitate financial markets, and the Government should step up its function of providing infrastructure for
growth, most crucially to meet the energy demand of productive sectors,’ he emphasized.

‘There is a need for coordinated efforts and support of the Government as well as of regulators (SBP &
SECP) and banks for the development of a fixed income market that is necessary to diversify the financial sector,
which in turn would enhance its role in supporting economic growth,’ he observed.

The SBP Governor said: ‘we have unambiguously designated our future path that includes three main
priorities (a) to make our banking sector more resilient against exogenous shocks through our macro (systemic)
and micro prudential framework, (b) actively encourage technological solutions for financial access and an efficient
payment system, and (c) address the development needs of the financial markets and broaden the array of
product and services as well as outreach.’

Mr. Anwar said that we would like to see our banks operating at world class standards and synergistically
reinforcing the real economy. ‘We are actively working at a pace to achieve this goal, and despite the current
economic challenges, we are confident that we will succeed,’ he said, adding that total assets of our banks amount
to Rs7.7 trillion as of end-June 2011. The deposits stand at Rs6.0 trillion, while advances and investments of the
sector are Rs3.8 trillion and Rs2.6 trillion respectively, he added.

He said that in spite of the economic slowdown, the pretax profit of the banking sector for the year 2010
was Rs105 billion and for the first six month of 2011, it was Rs77 billion. ‘The banks stand at a healthy Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of over 14 percent and have shown a steady increase in capital even in absolute terms, and
equity of the banks is now Rs722 billion (June 2011),’ he said and added: ‘while the picture appears quite stable,
the key challenge comes from economic slowdown. We have witnessed the impact of an economic slowdown
through rising credit risk in the banks.’

However, as banking regulator, the big challenge arises from a two-pronged dilemma, he said and added:
‘we want our banks to be sound, profitable and efficient users of their funds, yet we also want them to increase
financial service penetration into unbanked segments of the economy,’ the SBP Governor added.

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Kazi Abdul Muktadir disclosed
today that the International Strengthening Fund (ISF) has so far approved Rs. 632 million for 13
microfinance providers including top and middle tier Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) and Micro
Finance Institutions (MFIs).

Inaugurating the 6"" Pakistan Micro Finance Conference at a local hotel in Karachi, he
said that under the ISF arrangements (a UK grant of 10 million British pounds facility), ISF has
supported 20 projects for investments in key areas such as human resources (HR), information
technology (IT), product development, risk management systems, business plans and
branchless banking development. ‘The Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN) was also provided
funding support under ISF to conduct research and develop the industry’s infrastructure such as
the testing of microfinance Credit Information Bureau (CIB) in Lahore and its expansion to the
national level,’ he added.

He said that the Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility (MCGF), a 10 million British
pound guarantee facility, has so far mobilized commercial funding of Rs.6,325/- million to four
microfinance providers for onward lending to around 200,000 new micro borrowers. ‘Going
forward, the facility will aim to raise commercial debt from non bank sources, diversifying
sources of commercial capital for microfinance providers,’ Mr. Abdul Muktadir added.

He said the Financial Innovation Challenge Fund (FICF), which is also a 10 million British
pound facility, will provide new ways of meeting the larger demand for financial services. He
said that the first round of the Fund which was held to promote the “Government to Persons
(G2P) Payments” has now been successfully completed by deciding to award Rs. 505 million to
six projects being undertaken by the applicant institutions. ‘The 2nd FICF Round would be held
on rural financial services including agricultural finance and broad based financial services
projects using telecommunication infrastructure to promote micro payments for people who
are not part of financial services’, he added.

SBP Deputy Governor observed that it is encouraging that the investors’ enthusiasm in
microfinance has been on the rise especially in the last couple of years, and one of the major
drivers for investors is the opportunity to enter the branchless banking space.

Branchless Banking shows impressive
growth in fourth quarter: SBP

Branchless banking (BB) has witnessed an impressive growth during the fourth quarter
(April — June 2012) of the last fiscal year 2011-12 as the number of mobile banking accounts
touched the figure of 1.45 million, depicting a remarkable growth of 37 percent.

According to SBP’s ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’, posted on its website today, the
accounts’ activity level has also improved considerably during the quarter under review as the
number of active accounts increased by 66 percent. Over 28 million transactions worth
Rs.115.3 billion were processed during the April — June quarter. The number and value of
transactions have grown rapidly during April — June quarter by 12% and 36% respectively. The
growth in value of transactions is almost 3 times more than the growth in number of
transactions. The overall average size of transaction has increased from Rs 3,367 to Rs 4,065
during the quarter under review. The agents’ network has risen to 29,525 on 30"" June, 2012
from 26,792 as on 31° March, 2012 registering an increase of 10 percent. The agents now have
presence in 90 percent of the districts in the country.

Bills payments & mobile top-ups remained the dominating activity with 50 percent share
in total numbers, followed by person to person (over the counter) fund transfers with share of 36
percent. Loan repayments of Rs.464 million primarily of microfinance institutions were collected
through BB agents during the quarter.

According to the Newsletter, the growth expectation in coming quarters is fairly high as
the existing two BB players are increasing their scale of operations and six other banks are in
pilot phase and are likely to start their BB operations shortly. Moreover, banks are exploring
avenues to increase the attractiveness of the m-wallets for their customers, and offering them
new services such as purchasing air-tickets, receiving salaries/ pensions, utilizing ATM through
debit cards, and internet banking.

SBP launches new project on SME clusters survey in Pakistan

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today launched a new project on clusters survey of
10 important Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) Clusters in the country. The objective of
this project survey is to provide credible information base on key SME clusters/sub-sectors of
economic importance. Funded by the Department for International Development (DFID),
UK, the project will develop key drivers of business of important SME subsectors located in
various cities across the country.

The clusters selected for the survey include: Cotton Ginning, Marble and Marble
Products, Plastic Products, Hand-made Carpet Manufacturing, Leather Products, Dry-
cleaning and Laundry services, Beauty parlors and Spa, Super markets and Retail shops,
Printing Press and Gem & Jewelry.

M/s Corporate Development Partners (Pvt) Limited will conduct the survey which is
to be completed in four months.

This is an important project as availability of reliable and comprehensive data on
SMEs play a critical role in the development of the sector, helping the relevant stakeholders
in devising sector-specific effective business strategies.

This Project would specially help banks in targeting the selected SME clusters
through appropriate banking products and marketing/distribution strategies, thereby
increasing their penetration in SME sector.

It may be pointed out that SBP, in collaboration with International Finance

Speaking at the launching ceremony of a new product, “Easy Paisa Khushaal” of Tameer
Microfinance Bank (TMFB) and Telenor at a local hotel in Karachi this afternoon, he said: ‘The
existing active players — the Tameer Microfinance Bank (Easypaisa) and UBL (Omni) — have so
far registered more than 1,447,381 mobile wallet accounts (mWallet accounts) of un-banked
and under-banked population of the country.

(mWallet accounts are opened under Branchless Banking (BB) and include both Mobile
Phone and Smart Card accounts.

He said that nearly 30 million BB accounts worth Rs. 115 billion were processed during a
single quarter (April-June, 2012) by only two players (TMFB and UBL — Omni).

Mr Abdul Muktadir said that such type of innovations in product designing will not only
attract small savings to generate internal funding for Microfinance Banks (MFBs) but also
provide savers a feeling of safety and security of insurance embodied with the product. ‘Now
the time is only of demand-driven innovative products, through which MEBs can easily handle
the challenges like scarcity of funding and financial exclusion,’ he added.

‘With the entry of new players and scaling-up of the existing institutions, the present
growth momentum of BB accounts will rise further. Our Tele density also highlights the
inherent potential for mobile banking in Pakistan,’ he said and added that achievements in the
BB services have put Pakistan at the global centre stage of Financial Inclusion and innovation.
He said that the World Bank’s Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), in its recent study
has also recognized Pakistan as one of the fastest growing branchless banking market in the
World.

He said that the Government and the SBP have been supporting the microfinance sector
to reach out to the millions of un-served low-income people of the country. This growth is
facilitated by several factors, including an enabling policy framework, institutional reforms,
technology initiatives, regulatory flexibility, tax incentives and technical support through
different programs and projects, SBP Deputy Governor said.

State Bank of Pakistan has also issued a Strategic Framework for Sustainable
Microfinance in Pakistan which mainly focuses promoting use of alternative delivery channels
to enhance financial services to people without access to finance which is recognized as one of

We must stay ahead of counterfeiters and protect the
integrity of our currency,’ says Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said the main goal of
security printing for the central bank is to prevent forgery, tampering, and counterfeiting of
banknotes. ‘We must stay ahead of counterfeiters and protect the integrity of our currency,’ he
added.

Inaugurating the Upgraded Security Inks Manufacturing Facility of SICPA (Société
Industrielle et Commerciale de Produits Agricoles), Pakistan in Karachi today, he observed that
the soundness of a nation's currency is essential to the soundness of its economy. ‘As the
nation’s central bank, SBP has a wide range of responsibilities relating to banknotes, from
ensuring an adequate supply to protecting and maintaining confidence in the currency.,
Together with our partners at Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and the law
enforcement agencies, we continuously monitor the counterfeiting threats for each
denomination, and make re-design decisions based on these threats,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said that gaining and maintaining public confidence in the currency is a key
role for any central bank. ‘Undoubtedly, one of the major challenges facing a central bank in
ensuring public confidence in its currency is the rise of counterfeit banknotes,’ he added.

He said that advanced security features involving ink play a very important role in
defeating the endeavours of counterfeiters, thereby curbing the circulation of fake currency.
‘Increasingly, as counterfeiters become more sophisticated, the central banks admit that they
need to push security printing for new technologies and new substrates,’ he said.

‘To help prevent counterfeiting, SICPA’s security ink technology plays a vital role in
making our banknotes difficult to counterfeit through state-of-the-art security features such as
the Optical Variable Ink (OVI) design, Infra-red ink designs, UV fluorescent ink, and SICPA TALK
ink images,’ he added.

SBP Governor said that it is quite heartening to see the growth of PSPC and its
collaboration with SICPA — the leading global provider of security inks and solutions for most of
the world’s banknotes — for providing SBP and the nation with banknotes embodying the latest
security features based on SICPA’s security ink technology.

He observed that it must be ensured that ink based security features stay and do not
fade away early in the life of a banknote before it is taken out of circulation. ‘In the fast-paced

SBP advises banks to process cases of sugar export

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has advised all Authorized Dealers in Foreign Exchange (Banks) to

process the cases of sugar export as per the following mechanism:-

Banks will forward the requests of Sugar Mills along with photocopy of E-Form, copy of contract,
L/C, advance payment, etc. for approval of SBP. While forwarding such requests banks should
also maintain the record of each Sugar Mill to ensure compliance of maximum prescribed quota
of 5,000 tons per Sugar Mill.

All requests should be addressed to Director, Exchange Policy Department, State Bank of
Pakistan, I.|. Chundrigar Road, Karachi

SBP will allow permission against each E-Form on first come first served basis.

Banks will send sugar export update to Director, Exchange Policy Department, State Bank of
Pakistan, I.1. Chundrigar Road, Karachi on daily basis.

Incomplete requests will not be considered.

Applications received after July 23, 2012 will not be entertained, says an EPD Circular Letter
issued today to the Heads/ Principal Offices of all Authorized Dealers in Foreign Exchange
operating in Pakistan.

It may be pointed out that the Government of Pakistan has allowed export of sugar on the terms &

conditions as mentioned below:-

200,000 tons of sugar will be exported.

A quantity not in excess of 5,000/- tons shall be allowed to be exported by individual sugar mills
on first come first served basis.

The export shall be made only against E-Form.

The State Bank of Pakistan will monitor the export and no E-Form shall be issued in excess of

individual and cumulative ceiling mentioned above.

Pakistan’s economic performance is notable despite

challenges: SBP Third Quarterly Report

‘The economic growth of 3.7 percent during FY12 is higher than the 3.0 percent realized in the
previous year, but less than the target of 4.2 percent. Nevertheless, this performance is notable, given
the considerable damage to the cotton crop due to floods in August 2011; ongoing energy shortages;
the rise in international oil prices; and security concerns,’ the State Bank said in its Third Quarterly
Report for the fiscal year 2011-12 on the State of the Economy released today.

The Report said that this growth has also been more broad-based with a larger contribution
from the commodity producing sectors compared to FY11. Moreover, as in the past, growth has been
driven by domestic consumption (both private and public), which was partially offset by a decline in
domestic investment and external demand, the Report said and added that the continuous decline in
investment since the macro instability in 2008, is a source of growing concern as it will stifle the long
term growth of the economy.

It observed that although Pakistan’s economy has shown some recovery in terms of GDP
growth, the key macro indicators still remain weak. Persistent inflation and pressure on the fiscal and
current accounts, remain the key challenges for the economy, it added.

SBP Report said that while low investment and energy shortages have direct growth
implications, the persistently high fiscal deficit remains a major risk to the macro-economy. Current
information suggests a budget deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for Jul-Mar FY12, and it appears that the
budgetary gap for the full year will exceed the revised target of 4.7 percent, it said, adding that overall
revenues are lower than expected.

Though the growth in current expenditure is lower compared to the previous year, the
government has enhanced its development spending, it said and added: ‘While such spending should
improve the country’s long-term growth prospects, this also creates financing pressures.’ At the same
time, despite efforts to reform public sector enterprises (PSEs), the operational efficiency of key PSEs
has not improved, it said, adding that this continues to add to the country’s fiscal burden.

The Report said that in terms of financing this gap, the government relied more on domestic
sources as external financing dried up. The government borrowed Rs 847.5 billion in Jul-Mar FY12 from
domestic sources, compared to Rs 700.1 billion in the corresponding period of FY11, it said and added
that lately, this has been increasingly skewed towards borrowing from the central bank.

‘Such borrowing is inflationary and a risk to macro-stability. Currently, two Acts — namely the
Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation (FRDL) Act (2005) and the newly amended SBP Act- provide
guidelines on overall debt stocks and borrowing from the central bank, respectively,’ the Report said.

The Report said that the large fiscal deficit has resulted in a sharp increase in Pakistan’s debt. It
said that Government domestic debt recorded an increase of Rs 1.2 trillion during Jul-Mar 2012 to reach

MR. YASEEN ANWAR STRESSES THE NEED FOR CONTINUED COLLABORATION
AMONGST D-8 CENTRAL BANKS TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THEIR ECONOMIES

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has stressed the need for continued
collaboration amongst the D-8 central banks to further strengthen their economies. He said that
macroeconomic policies of D-8 countries must be balanced to check overheating pressures from strong
recovery, high credit growth, volatile capital flows, elevated commodity prices, and renewed risk of

inflation.

While opening and chairing the 2"" meeting of Central Bank Governors of D-8 countries in
Islamabad today, Mr. Anwar observed that we must continue to rebalance our economies to sustain
growth through modulating domestic consumption, increase in trade and allow capital to flow freely
between emerging and developing economies in search of better returns as against investment in debt

ridden advanced economies.

He noted that a sudden drop in the growth rate in 2009 immediately after the 2008 crises was perhaps
the principal reason why the D-8 Central Bank Governors in their first meeting agreed to set this meeting
agenda on strengthening monetary and financial cooperation. ‘The global growth is projected to further
drop from 3.8 percent in 2011 to about 3.3 percent in 2012. As a result, the real GDP growth in the
emerging and developing economies is projected to be further slower from 6.3 percent in 2011 to 5.2
percent in 2012. Therefore, we need continued collaboration to further strengthen our economies’, he

added.

There is only one central bank in each country/monetary area, and therefore, it is very logical for
central banks to look beyond their national borders for advice and collaboration, he said and added that in
recent years, increasing globalization has further enhanced the need for central banks’ cooperation to
tackle risks due to the cross border interdependencies and to make the most of emerging opportunities.
The central banks’ cooperation has been facilitated through collaborative multilateral forums such as the
G20, the FSB and the meetings of the IMF, BIS and a number of bilateral and regional initiatives for
cooperation. “The enhanced role of these forums also reflects the increasingly important role that the

central banks of emerging and developing economies are playing at these international forums’, he added.

Stressing the need for strengthening cooperation amongst D-8 countries, the SBP Governor said
its (D-8) Secretariat must be strengthened to collect and maintain information on our economies and their

interconnectedness. ‘This would serve the dual purpose as it would provide regular updates on the state of

Islamic banking industry in Pakistan set to double
its market share in next five years: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has expressed the hope that Pakistan’s
Islamic banking industry is all set to double its market share in the next five years.

Inaugurating the second two-day International Conference on Islamic Business (ICIB) on
‘Managing Shariah Conforming Businesses: Prospects, Practices and Personnel’ organized by Riphah
International University at the National Institute of Banking & Finance (NIBAF), Islamabad today, he said
that Islamic banking industry in Pakistan is growing at a fast pace and maintaining an average growth rate
of 30 percent over the past six years.

He said the Islamic banking industry’s asset base has reached Rs. 641 billion which constitutes
almost 8 percent of the overall banking industry while deposits represent 8.5 percent of the banking
system’s deposits. Islamic banking network is also spread across the country at a significant pace with the
total number of branches reaching 886, he said, adding that the industry is still facing challenges and
constraints that need to be addressed to sustain the growth momentum.

‘Given its relatively short history, the industry has over one trillion dollar assets with presence in
over 75 countries across the globe. The widespread growth has not only been a result of activities of pure
Islamic financial institutions but also has contributions of conventional institutions that eyed Islamic
finance as a profitable economic opportunity. Moreover, resilience of Islamic financial institutions during
the financial crisis has lent them more credence than their interest-based conventional counterparts,’
SBP Governor added.

Mr. Anwar said that a closer look at the second round impacts of recent financial crisis shows
that Islamic financial institutions did take some hit as a result of downturn in property markets (real
sector). He said that the inherent risk sharing mechanism though has helped the industry steer through
this turbulent period but economic anxiety of these times has pointed towards the need of better risk
management practices and due diligence on part of Islamic financial institutions.

SBP Governor pointed out that Islamic banks, both at global and domestic level, are working in
the shadow of conventional finance i.e. adoption of conventional products that have been tailored to
comply with Shariah principles. He said that problems of moral hazard, adverse selection are of serious
nature and remain a major hurdle in using participatory modes of financing. ‘However, their absence
deprives the industry from attaining one of its desired socio economic goals of ensuring equitable
distribution of wealth. State Bank of Pakistan is aware of the issue and is working on a framework in
consultation with the industry to encourage participatory mode based financing,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said that agriculture and SME are sectors of paramount importance in terms of their
contribution to Pakistan’s GDP, employment generation and overall development of the country.
However, these remain largely ignored despite their huge potential and financing appetite, he added.
‘For example, agriculture comprises 21% of GDP and 45% of the workforce, that Pakistan is also the fifth
largest milk producer in the world but does not export any dairy products as New Zealand. This
represents huge Sharia compliant opportunities for Islamic banks,’ he said and added that reaching out
to such sectors will not only be beneficial for Islamic financial industry but will also guarantee economic
welfare of the society. ‘Realizing the significance of Shariah-compliant agriculture financing, the State

depending upon their branch network.

The field offices of SBP BSC will start issuing one packet each of Rs. 10/- and
Rs. 20/- denomination fresh currency notes per person from tomorrow (October 11,
2012) while branches of all commercial banks will issue fresh notes to the visiting

Banks surpass annual agri. credit disbursement
target during last fiscal year

Banks have surpassed the agri. credit disbursement target for the last fiscal year (2011-12) by
extending loans amounting to Rs 293.8 billion to agriculturists which is 8.8 billion (103 percent of annual
target) more than the indicative target of Rs 285 billion set by the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee
(ACAC) for the whole fiscal year. It is 11.7 percent higher than Rs 263 billion disbursed in 2010-11.

Five large banks collectively disbursed agri. loans amounting to Rs 146.3 billion or 103.7% of their
annual target (Rs 141 billion) in fiscal year 2011-12, higher by 4.3% as compared with Rs 140.3 billion
disbursed during the preceding fiscal year (FY2010-11). National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), Habib Bank Limited
(HBL), MCB Bank, Allied Bank Limited (ABL) & United Bank Limited (UBL) have surpassed their annual targets
by achieving 106.0%, 103.5%, 103.3%, 102.8% and 100.7% disbursement respectively. Zarai Taraqiati Bank
Limited (ZTBL) disbursed Rs 66.06 billion or 94.2% of its annual target of Rs 70.1 billion while Punjab
Provincial Co-operative Bank Limited (PPCBL) by disbursing Rs 8.5 billion or 112.1% has surpassed its annual
target (Rs 7.6 billion) during FY 2011-12.

Fourteen Domestic Private Banks as a group achieved 112.5% of their target (Rs 54.1 billion) by
disbursing agri. loan of Rs 60.9 billion. The Bank of Khyber, Bank Al Habib, Faysal Bank, Soneri Bank, NIB Bank
and Askari Bank have surpassed their annual agri. credit disbursement targets by achieving 174.6%,
147.6%,136.7%,132.4%,104.1% and 100.4 % disbursement respectively while other remaining banks could
not meet their annual targets.

Five Microfinance Banks as a group disbursed agri. loans of Rs 12.1 billion or 99.3% of their annual
target of Rs 12.2 billion during FY 2011-12.

It may be pointed out here that the banks had been missing the agri. credit disbursement targets
since 2008-09. Achievement of agri. credit disbursement target during the year ended June 2012 was
extremely difficult in the backdrop of continuous declining trend in the overall Private Sector Credit and high
agri. Non-performing Loans (NPLs) of major banks due to devastating floods of 2010 and heavy rains of 2011
in Sindh province. However, SBP adopted a multipronged strategy and made all out efforts in achieving the
target of Rs 285 billion allocated by ACAC. The efforts of SBP officials not only helped banks in achieving their
target but also surpassing it. These efforts included swift settlement of crop loan insurance claims, close co-
ordination with provincial revenue departments to facilitate the One Window Operation in agri. intensive
districts for timely completion of revenue formalities, holding of farmers’ awareness and financial literacy
programs at grass root level, and follow up of targets with the top management of banks and their agri.

SBP AND ICIEC SIGN MoU TO PROMOTE
TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN PAKISTAN

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export
Credit (ICIEC), a member of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Group, have signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) to cooperate in promoting trade and investment in Pakistan.

The MoU, which was signed by Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan and Dr. Abdul
Rehman Taha, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), ICIEC at a simple but impressive ceremony held at SBP, Karachi today,
is aimed at establishing a basis for the exchange of information between the two entities on banking industry’s
condition and operating performance and ICIEC exposures on the banks operating in the country.

Under the MoU, both the parties shall cooperate for the purpose of promoting and supporting the flow of
trade and investment to and from Pakistan, in accordance with the prevalent laws and regulations. SBP shall
endeavour to provide/share banking industry wide (not of individual bank) information and its reports, papers etc
on foreign investment environment in Pakistan with ICIEC as and when desired by it (ICIEC).

The ICIEC operations in Pakistan, among others, would include provision of Shariah compliant insurance
coverage to Letters of Credit (LC) issuing banks in Pakistan, which will help them in getting their LCs confirmed at

STATE BANK KEEPS POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 12 PERCENT

The Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan at its meeting held under the
Chairmanship of SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today has decided to keep the policy
rate unchanged at 12 percent after making an assessment of macro economic challenges facing the
country’s economy.

The economy basically needs fundamental reforms to engineer a turnaround in economic
performance. Inflation expectations cannot be effectively anchored around single digit targets
without limiting fiscal borrowings from the banking system, particularly the SBP, according to the
Monetary Policy Decision issued after the Central Board meeting.

The size of the external current account deficit for FY13 as percent of GDP is projected to be
approximately the same as in FY12. ‘However, due to anticipated rise in debt payments in FY13, the
economy would need substantial external inflows to preserve our foreign exchange reserves.
Further, the problems in the euro zone have increased uncertainty in the global economy,’ Monetary
Policy Decision said and added that being a safe haven for investors, the US dollar has strengthened
significantly in the past few weeks against almost all currencies, especially the euro, and Pakistan
rupee was no exception.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

‘While managing the external and fiscal pressures remain more of an immediate concern, the real
challenge lies in reviving private investment in the economy. Inflationary pressures have not
subsided either despite sluggish GDP growth. At the same time, the scheduled banks continue to
avoid extending credit to private businesses, which are already suffering from energy shortages.
Fiscal authority, on the other hand, is accumulating short term domestic debt at a rapid pace.

The impact of SBP’s monetary policy, in these circumstances, is less effective. The economy basically
needs fundamental reforms to engineer a turnaround in economic performance. For instance,
inflation expectations cannot be effectively anchored around single digit targets without limiting
fiscal borrowings from the banking system, particularly the SBP. Borrowing from the banking system
has risen substantially during this fiscal year, Rs 1098 billion (Rs707 billion excluding the Rs391 billion
related to the partial settlement of circular debt), from 1st July to 25th May, FY12 with borrowing
from SBP (on cash basis) expanding by Rs 414 billion during the same period. In fact, the latter has
accelerated during 1st April to 4th June, 2012, increasing by Rs310 billion, pushing the outstanding
stock to Rs1660 billion (on cash basis). This behaviour contravenes the SBP (Amendment) Act 2012,
which requires not only zero quarterly borrowings but also envisages their retirement in the next
seven years.

Not surprisingly, the year-on-year CPI inflation has increased to 12.3 percent in May 2012. A
noteworthy aspect of inflation behaviour is its persistence at this high level alongside slack economic

Branchless Banking (BB) continued to show a rising trend in the third quarter (January-
March 2012) of the current fiscal year (2011-12) during which BB transactions surged by 23
percent to 25.3 million as compared with 20.6 million in the preceding quarter. The value of
these transactions was recorded at Rs 85.092 billion, showing a growth of 7 percent as
compared with Rs 79.410 billion in the quarter ended on December 31, 2011.

According to SBP’s ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’, the average daily BB transactions
increased to 280,798 in the third quarter showing a growth of 23 percent as compared to
228,858 transactions in the previous quarter. BB deposits grew by 18 percent to Rs 594 million
in Jan-March 2012 quarter as compared with Rs 503 million in the preceding quarter.

The total number of Branchless Banking agents increased by 19 percent to 26,792 in
January-March FY12 quarter as compared with 22,512 in the quarter ended on December 31,
2011. Similarly, the total number of BB accounts surged by 14 percent to surpass one million

which 52% have more than 90 agents which are mainly located in low income urban or rural
communities.

The number of registered m-wallet accounts (a popular Branchless Banking service in
which cash value is stored on mobile phone of a customer; this can be used to deposit,
withdrawal, and money transfer through the mobile phone) reached to 1.03 million at the end
of the quarter under review in which the number of active m-wallets is about 53%. About 5,573
debit cards have also been provided to mobile account holders, indicating efforts to create

Bills payment remained the dominating activity of Branchless Banking with 42% share in
total transaction volume, followed by person to person (over the counter) fund transfers and
airtime top-ups with share of 32% and 10% respectively. Branchless Banking service providers
are trying to increase their linkages with microfinance institutions as loan repayments of Rs.312

State Bank allows MFBs to lend Micro- enterprises up to Rs. 500,000/

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to allow Microfinance Banks (MFBs) to lend to
microenterprises any amount upto Rs. 500,000. This decision of SBP will help in addressing the
credit needs of a large microenterprise market which has traditionally remained unbanked, and
will also provide an opportunity to microfinance banks to upscale their credit operations.
Earlier, MFBs were allowed to lend up to Rs. 150,000/- for general purpose loans to individuals.

With a view to improving access to finance for microenterprises the State Bank has amended
Prudential Regulations 10 & 11 for Microfinance Banks (MFBs) pertaining to “Maximum Loan
Size, and Disclosure of Basic Terms & Conditions of Financial Products”, and “Maximum
Exposure of a borrower from MFBs / MFls / other Financial Institutions/ NGOs”.

For the purpose of the above mentioned regulations, the term ‘microenterprise’ shall mean
projects or businesses in trading/manufacturing/services/agriculture sectors that lead to
livelihood improvement and income generation. Moreover, these projects/businesses are
undertaken by micro-entrepreneurs who are either self-employed or employ few individuals
not exceeding 10 (excluding seasonal labor).

The aggregate exposure of a borrower who is eligible to avail both general and micro-enterprise
loans shall not exceed Rs. 500,000/-. Further, MFBs shall restrict their exposure under
microenterprise lending at maximum 40% of their gross loan portfolio ensuring a fair share of
lending to each economic segment of the target market.

MFBs shall apply to Director-AC&MFD for seeking approval of SBP before undertaking
‘microenterprise’ lending. SBP shall grant approval based on satisfactory assessment of the
Capital position and readiness level of the applicant MFB, says AC&MFD Circular No. 02 of
March 16, 2012.

MEBs shall henceforth also obtain CIB reports for all types of credit facilities on mandatory
basis, the circular said and added that MFBs shall ensure meticulous compliance of the above
instructions and non-compliance shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the
Microfinance Institutions Ordinance, 2001.

2ND MEETING OF THE GOVERNORS
OF DEVELOPING EIGHT (D-8) COUNTRIES HELD IN ISLAMABAD 21 NOVEMBER 2012

Joint Communiqué

1. We, the Governors of Central Banks of Developing Eight (D-8) Countries, held our second
meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan on November 21, 2012 with Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor of
the State Bank of Pakistan in the Chair to achieve the objectives of increasing our mutual
understanding of various economic and financial sector related challenges facing us, and
enhancing co-operation among ourselves to confront these challenges.

2. Since we last met in Abuja, Nigeria in July 2010, the global economy continues to face a
number of challenges. External, fiscal and financial imbalances still persist, creating
challenges on economic growth and employment. Global growth is projected to drop in 2012
because of weak economic activity in the US and deteriorating sovereign and banking
sector developments in the euro area. As a result, Real GDP growth in the emerging and
developing economies is going to further slowdown. Although the impacts and related
challenges may be different from country to country, and region to region, we are all united
in our resolve to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth in a collaborative way.
Specifically, we will:

a. Formulate monetary and financial policies to support sustainable growth strategy in
D-8 countries in the backdrop of an uncertain outlook for the global economy

b. Promote Innovative Financial Inclusion Policies

Explore opportunities in Islamic Finance

d. Establish information exchange and promote peer learning amongst D-8 central
banks

o

Sustainable Growth Strategy

3. We must work together to formulate monetary and financial policies to support sustainable
growth strategy for D-8 countries in the backdrop of an uncertain outlook for the global
economy. The D-8 economies face a diverse set of economic challenges. Some of these
are structural; others may be cyclical in nature, while others a direct consequence of the
global credit crunch of 2007-08 and the recent Euro area crises. However, in formulating a
growth strategy to deal with these issues — and to identify areas of potential cooperation
between members -— it is necessary to understand these challenges better. In order to
achieve this, we have agreed to collaborate and focus on:

a. Developing and using monetary and financial policy tools that can buffer the domestic
economy against the global slowdown by striking a balance between nurturing
sustainable domestic demand and an export-led growth model.

b. Reduce dependency on demand from traditional trade partners by rebalancing and
diversifying the sources of economic growth in the domestic economies by focusing on
opportunities for greater cooperation amongst regional blocs, such as the D-8.

State Bank allows banks to exchange Rs. 500
old design banknote till October 01, 2012

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed all commercial banks/Microfinance Banks (MFBs)
and the field offices of SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) operating throughout the country to
exchange Rs. 500 old design (bigger size) banknote until close of banking hours on October 01, 2012.

It may be pointed out that earlier the deadline of exchange of Rs. 500 old design (bigger size)
banknote was September 30, 2012. However, September 30, 2012 is Sunday, the Federal Government,
through a Gazette Notification issued in June, 2012 has facilitated the public to exchange the
demonetized Rs 500 (old design) banknote until October 01, 2012.

The State Bank of Pakistan/SBP BSC will neither exchange nor be liable to pay any value of such
banknote to any person or a bank after the deadline fixed above (i.e., October 01, 2012).

Branches of banks/NBP Chests/Sub-Chests should display posters/banners regarding the revised
date for the acceptance of the demonetized Rs. 500 old design banknotes (bigger size), at public
counters and other visible places in and outside their branches, according to a Circular Letter issued by
SBP to the Presidents/Chief Executives of all commercial banks/Microfinance banks.

SBP has also directed all banks to issue the necessary instructions to their respective branches to
ensure meticulous compliance of time lines for the exchange of demonetized Rs 500 old design (bigger
size) banknotes by displaying posters/banners for awareness of the general public. Instructions issued to
banks in this regard can be viewed at SBP’s_ website on the following _ link:

Mobile banking accounts have jumped to 1.8 million mark depicting a remarkable growth
of 25 percent during July-September quarter of 2012, according to Branchless Banking
Newsletter released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today. Branchless Banking (BB)
customers conducted almost 31.5 million transactions worth Rs. 139 billion during the quarter.
The average size of each transaction was Rs 4,420, while the average number of transaction
per day increased to 0.349 million.

The accounts’ activity level has also improved considerably during the quarter at the
back of significant growth of 84% in Level ‘0’ accounts and 7% growth in Level ‘1’ accounts.
These accounts are opened at the agents’ location largely by those who have traditionally been
excluded from the banking services. The agents’ network has reached to 31,637 as of 30th
September, 2012 from 29,525 as on 30th June, 2012 registering an increase of 7 percent.

It may be pointed out that transaction limits for Level ‘0’ & Level ‘1’ accounts are Rs
15,000 & Rs. 25,000 per day respectively.

Bills payments & mobile top-ups remained the dominating activity during July-September
2012 quarter with 45 percent share in total numbers, followed by person to person (over the
counter) fund transfers with a share of 38 percent. Bulk payments mostly by agents topped,
among others, by 41 percent share in total value transacted during the quarter followed by
person to person fund transfers with a share of 34 percent.

It may be pointed out that the BB service providers are trying to increase their linkages
with microfinance institutions as loan repayments of Rs.646 million were collected through
Branchless Banking agents during the quarter.

According to the Newsletter, the growth expectation in coming quarters is fairly high as
the existing two Branchless Banking players are increasing their scale of operations and two
banks namely Waseela Microfinance Bank and Askari Bank Limited have launched their
branchless banking services under the brand names of ‘Mobicash’ and ‘Timepey’ respectively.

the company’s letter head duly signed by the authorized representative.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) through a circular had advised the banks not to issue bundles

SBP makes Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism Regulations more comprehensive

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has made Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Regulations more comprehensive by revising the existing
regulations M-1 to M-5 of Prudential Regulations on Corporate/ Commercial Banking.

While most of the requirements of the new regulations are already in place, some of the
requirements will be effective from October 31, 2012. These regulations have been issued
today to all banks/ development finance institutions (DFls) with a view to introducing a
comprehensive regulatory framework in line with international standards to mitigate the
various risks arising from money laundering and terrorist financing.

The AML/CFT Regulations provide a system of Risk Based Approach under which
customers will be profiled as per risk involved. A framework of Scenario based ranking of
customers has been developed, which will help in detecting abnormal behavior or transactions
during the course of relationship. The revised system will ensure clean and transparent banking
transactions on the one hand and will enable the country to meet international standards on
the other.

The provisions of Regulations introduce a system of comprehensive list of ‘Red Alerts’ in
the context of Pakistan, which will trigger scrutiny of accounts and transactions to ensure that
proceeds of crime are not processed through the banking channels.

To address the issue of rigidity in obtaining documents for opening accounts, the list of
identification and verification documents has been expanded and NADRA Receipt/ Token
included as eligible document for opening of bank account. This will enable customers to open
bank account by submitting any document issued by NADRA including CNIC, Passport, NARA,
POC or even a NADRA Receipt/ Token. The new Regulations now require banks/DFls to keep
record for a minimum period of 10 years.

With the view to tracing back the illegal transactions, it is mandatory on banks/ DFls to
obtain a copy of CNIC from occasional customers/walk-in customers conducting cash
transactions above Rs. 1 million and in case of online transfers without any limit. Banks/ DFls
now have to capture, retain and provide at the beneficiary end, all relevant details of customers
while transferring funds between the cities.

In case of wire transfers, clear responsibilities of ordering, beneficiary and intermediary
institution have been outlined for compliance of banks/ DFls. Customers’ profiles should be
linked with automated transaction monitoring software for creation of alerts in case of
suspicious transactions/activities.

component of SBP’s financial sector development strategy. ‘It envisages transforming the
financial market into an equitable system with efficient market based financial services to

SBP Governor said the State Bank will keep on working with all stakeholders to
ensure that the financial system is well positioned to meet the growing needs of the
economy and for achieving ‘our shared goals of economic growth and prosperity’.

considered safe, relative to some of the advanced nations, where confidence in financial
institutions has dwindled as a result of the recent financial crises. People still feel safe to

Branchless Banking network expands by 16 percent
to 22,512 in second quarter of FY12: SBP publication

The Branchless Banking (BB) network in Pakistan expanded by 16 percent in the second quarter
(October- December 2011) of the current fiscal year (2011-12) to reach 22,512 agents covering the
entire length and breadth of the country, says State Bank’s ‘Branchless Banking Newsletter’ released
today.

According to the publication, the number of Branchless Banking accounts increased by 40
percent to 929,184 in October- December, 2011 period as compared to the previous quarter. The total
Branchless Banking deposits jumped by 169 percent to Rs 503 million in the quarter under review as
compared to the previous quarter, it said, adding that the number of Branchless Banking transactions
during the second quarter surged by 30 percent to 20.6 million while the value of transactions showed a
growth of 35 percent to reach Rs. 79,410 million.

The average size of branchless banking transaction was Rs. 3,855 while the average number of
daily transactions was 228,855. This shows that mobile phone technology and agent-based banking are
helping access to financial services by the hitherto unbanked poor, the Newsletter said, adding that by
the end of December 2011, more than 929,000 customers have been registered as m-wallet users.

The Newsletter said that innovative branchless banking models have been penetrating in all
areas of payments such as utility bills, Government-to-Persons (G2P), Persons-to-Persons (P2P)
payments while scaling up other services relating to deposits and loans.

Bills payment & top-ups remained the dominating activity in the quarter under review with 53
percent share in total numbers, followed by fund transfers and deposits with share of 39 percent and 8
percent respectively, it said and added that the P2P payments remained the most popular mechanism
with 74% share in the total funds transfer. Initial high concentration in P2P transactions suggests that
the industry needs to develop a viable value-proposition for registration and activation of mobile
accounts, it added.

Consumer expectation surveys will facilitate the process of
designing a forward-looking monetary policy: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has said that the consumer
expectation surveys will facilitate the process of designing a forward-looking monetary policy in
the country. ‘Such surveys will help us study the inflation expectations and economic
confidence of households and their reaction to economic and policy decisions’, he added.

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Centre for Survey Research (CSR) at SBP,
Karachi this afternoon, he said that these expectation surveys are based on households’
perceptions about current as well as future economic conditions. ‘Expectations regarding
inflation, interest rates, stock prices, and employment are important for policy formulation,’ he
said, adding that this explains why many developed and developing countries are using
household surveys for policy research purposes.

Mr. Anwar said that until recent times, a documentation of the expectations channel at
the household level and one that is nationally representative of Pakistan was not available with
either SBP or the private sector. It was this very fact which made it all the more important for
the State Bank of Pakistan, being the central bank of the country, to enhance its efforts to
collect information on expectations, he said and added: ‘this will allow us to undertake
meaningful research, well-supported by first-hand knowledge of the situation in the country.’

He said that it was against this backdrop that the idea of undertaking households’
expectation and confidence surveys was developed. ‘I am glad that we have the support of a
reputable institution like Institute of Business Administration. The groundwork has been laid by
both the institutions to make the project a real success. It should be noted that the survey is of
particular importance in that it is the first such exercise undertaken on ‘full- scale’ level in
Pakistan. In this regard, a pilot project was completed last July, which enabled us to stop,
rethink and ultimately adopt the most appropriate strategy to steer this idea into practice,’ he
added.

SBP Governor said that this joint effort between SBP’s Research Department and
Professors in Accounting and Law, Computer Sciences, Economics, Statistics of the Institute of
Business Administration will go a long way in providing a reliable set of information regarding
consumers’ expectations in Pakistan. ‘Apart from its instantaneous contribution towards the
process of policy formulation, | hope that this project will be of great help to future generations
of policy makers in Pakistan, primarily by bi-monthly documenting consumers’ expectations, he
added.

SBP decides to publish Bank-wise Excess Cash Reserve Data

The State Bank of Pakistan has now decided to publish Bank-wise data on Excess Cash
Reserves maintained by Banks over and above the minimum required Cash Reserve
Requirement (CRR). This data will be disclosed with a lag of about one month; and will help in
differentiating between the relative performances of various banks in their money market
operations. Excess cash reserve not only adversely impacts smooth functioning of the interest
rate corridor but also has implications on banks’ own liquidity management. SBP expects that
dissemination of this data will bring more transparency and efficiency in the domestic money

market.

The web link to access this data is
http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/BWECR. pdf

 

It may be pointed out that the State Bank of Pakistan has been publishing the
consolidated weekly data on excess cash reserves of banks since December 2011 in order to
incentivize banks to bring more efficiency in their money market operations and the above

mentioned decision of SBP is in continuation of that initiative.

SBP Governor stresses the need for developing & implementing good
governance practices to provide impetus to economic growth

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has stressed the need for developing
and implementing good governance practices in order to provide impetus to economic growth.

Delivering his keynote address at the 4"" CEO Summit and book launching of “100 Business
Leaders of Pakistan” at a local hotel in Karachi today, he said that good corporate governance regimes
cannot be underscored more as they create an attractive investment climate necessary to maintain
investors’ confidence, resulting in positive impact on the share price and creating possibilities for raising
low cost capital.

Leaders must be visionary to see the future trends, anticipate institutional bottlenecks, remain
competitive and be able to adapt rapidly to changes, he said and added that leaders need also to take
into account their corporate social responsibility so that profit seeking is balanced against the objective
of social service and well being of society.

Mr. Anwar observed that Pakistan’s corporate sector has survived in perhaps one of the most
challenging environments, and yet it has flourished. ‘There are challenges to expanding abroad —
challenges that our companies may not have encountered previously. But I, for one, would like to see
more of our corporate sector aggressively targeting the regional and global market. | challenge you to
dream larger than ever before’, he added.

He noted that the millions of Pakistanis abroad will give you an edge as you venture abroad.
‘They will be familiar with your brands, and with the quality of your products. They may just hold the key
to giving you a foothold in international markets’, he added.

He pointed out that FDI is investment in tangible assets in the real sector. ‘That means that
money and capital flows through FDI are not very volatile. And it is the volatility in such flows that keeps
any central banker awake at night’, Mr. Anwar added. SBP Governor said that Pakistan’s economy
should move away from a persisting fascination with inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a metric
of the economy’s health and, at least, give Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) the attention it
deserves.

He observed that the world today is passing through a turbulent phase that requires a
realignment of our leadership approach to managing businesses. ‘Today’s business leader is faced with
a multitude of challenges, both on external and internal fronts. The complexities arising in the eco-
system of any business may arise in the shape of macro economic imbalances that include sagging
demand, inflation, volatility in financial markets, etc.’, he added.

SBP Governor said: “The most significant lesson that we have learnt from recent events is the
importance of fundamentals in risk management. For instance, there is a basic rule since inception of

SBP brings down policy rate to a single digit (9.5%

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has cut its policy rate by 50 basis points to bring it down from 10
percent to 9.5 percent with effect from 17"" December, 2012. This was decided by the Central Board of
Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan at its meeting held under the chairmanship of SBP Governor,
Mr.Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today.

According to the Monetary Policy Decision, the decline in CPI inflation is considerably faster than earlier
estimates. The year-on-year CPI inflation for November 2012 stands at 6.9 percent, with food inflation
dropping to 5.3 percent and non-food inflation coming down to 8.1 percent. Even the core inflation
measures are in single digits. This broad based deceleration in inflation is now expected to keep the
average inflation for FY13 below the 9.5 percent target for the year. Therefore, the Central Board of
Directors of SBP has decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent with effect from
17 December 2012.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

‘The changes in fundamental variables influencing the recent monetary policy decisions of SBP continue
to support the current stance. The credit extended to private businesses remains muted. The
deceleration in CPI inflation is faster than the projected path. And the external current account deficit in
October 2012 is small. The overall stress in the external position, however, is increasing given the
declining financial inflows and substantial debt repayments. Assigning appropriate weights to these
competing considerations is the main challenge currently faced by monetary policy.

Led by direct and portfolio investment flows, the total net capital and financial account inflows are on a
declining path for some years now. For instance, these inflows have come down from a peak of 7.2
percent of GDP in FY07 to 0.7 percent of GDP in FY12. This trend is continuing in FY13. During the first
four months, there has been a net outflow of $304 million from the capital and financial account. This,
together with substantial debt repayments to the IMF, has resulted in a decline in foreign exchange
reserves of SBP from $10.8 billion at end-June 2012 to $8.6 billion as on 14 December 2012. Thus,
despite an external current account surplus of $258 million during July-October, FY13, there has been
some pressure on the rupee to depreciate. Since the beginning of FY13, the rupee, viz-a-viz dollar, has
depreciated by 3.3 percent.

This stressed external position has implications for the rest of the economy. For instance, the decline in
foreign exchange reserves is causing contraction in rupee liquidity. A depreciating currency is also
affecting the size of the outstanding external debt in rupee terms and thus has implications for the fiscal
position. Moreover, the magnitude and speed of pass through of exchange rate changes to CPI inflation
need to be monitored closely in these circumstances.

SBP Governor, Mr Yaseen Anwar stresses upon banks, mobile
network operators to promote Branchless Banking

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Yaseen Anwar has stressed upon the banks and
mobile network operators (MNOs) to promote branchless banking for the benefit of the
unbanked and underserved people of the country.

‘If the banks and mobile network operators want to succeed, they have to assign a strategic
priority to branchless banking’, he said while inaugurating a one-day workshop on ‘Future of
Branchless Banking, Payment Systems and Financial Inclusion’ which was jointly organized by
SBP, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor
(CGAP) of the World Bank at a local hotel in Karachi today.

He emphasized that the Boards and Chief Executives of banks and MNOs must have ownership
of branchless banking and added that this will help to bring commitment, attention, and
support from every level of the organizations to this innovative, exciting and challenging
service.

Mr. Anwar said that SBP has taken several policy and developmental initiatives to promote
financial inclusion in the country. ‘Today, our regulatory environment for microfinance and
branchless banking is considered one of the best globally’, he added.

‘As a result of SBP regulations on “Branchless Banking”, we have seen emergence of four
mobile banking deployments which are not only advancing new frontiers for financial inclusion
but also pushing the expansion in the payment ecosystem of the country’, he said, adding that
these providers are investing heavily in hiring, training, and branding their agents, thus
contributing to the development of a new layer of distribution network for serving largely
unbanked market.

SBP Governor said that mobile phone subscribers are almost 120 million, while banking
accounts stand at 32 million whereas the number of borrowers is only 5.7 million which
indicates that there exists a large ‘financially-excluded’ market ‘Bringing this un-served market
into the formal financial system is our key objective as we believe that this would enrich the
socio-economic development of our country’, he added.

He pointed out that the brick and mortar retail network of the entire financial industry of
Pakistan stands at around 11,000 outlets after 65 years while the branchless banking retail
agents’ network has grown beyond 32,000 agents in a short span of 3 years.

With almost 1.8 million mobile banking accounts, the branchless banking customers conducted
almost 32 million transactions worth Rs. 140 billion during the quarter ending September 2012,

STATE BANK LEAVES POLICY RATE UNCHANGED
AT 12 PERCENT;INCREASES MINIMUM PROFIT RATE
ON SAVING DEPOSITS FROM 5 TO 6 PERCENT.

The Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan at its meeting held under the
Chairmanship of SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today has decided to keep the policy rate
unchanged at 12 percent. The State Bank has also decided to raise the minimum Profit Rate on PKR
Saving/PLS Saving Products from 5.0 to 6.0 percent.

‘It was the expectation of SBP that these deposits will respond to market forces and adjust
accordingly. The rigidity of the deposit rates, especially for small savers, is adversely impacting the
savings-investment ratio of the economy, the State Bank of Pakistan said in its Monetary Policy Decision.

It said that a more balanced risk-reward incentive structure is warranted in the shape of
appropriate deposit rate structure, as the savers, especially the smaller ones, need to be adequately
compensated. ‘Therefore, it has been decided that, effective May 1st, 2012, all Banks are required to
pay a minimum Profit Rate of 6.0 percent on PKR Saving/PLS Saving Products,’ it added.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

‘As the economy begins the last quarter of current fiscal year, SBP’s monetary management
continues to play its part in balancing the implications of multiple challenges faced by the economy. The
primary consideration remains bringing inflation further down as it has persistently remained in double
digits in the last few years. Ensuring smooth functioning of the payment system and financial stability is
also important given the current stressed liquidity conditions in the market. Similarly, elevated
international oil prices, weak quantum of exports, and insufficient foreign financial flows require careful
management of the external position. Last but not least, the consistent decline in private investment is
also an important factor in formulating the monetary policy strategy as it impacts both the medium
term inflation, growth and employment prospects.

Given limited set of instruments, not all these challenges can be effectively tackled by monetary
policy alone. There are bound to be tradeoffs involved among these competing considerations. A
supporting fiscal strategy and an active economic reform agenda is critical to deal with some of the
structural issues, in particular, low tax to GDP ratio and energy shortages. Most importantly, the
economy needs a forward-looking approach to policy making with strict adherence to rules laid out in
the legal frameworks, be it the State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Act (2012) or Fiscal Responsibility
and Debt Limitation (FRDL) Act (2005).

Following this approach is crucial in anchoring inflation expectations around the medium term
targets of 9.5 percent for FY13 and 8 percent for FY14 as envisaged in the Medium Term Budgetary
Framework (MTBF) of the government. In March 2012 the year-on-year CPI inflation was 10.8 percent
and, given the current economic conditions, is projected to remain in double digits during FY13.
Consistently growing government borrowing requirement from the banking system is a key variable that

Mr. Yaseen Anwar asks banks to adopt
agri. financing as viable business model

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has urged upon the banks to adopt
agricultural financing as viable business model through development of specific products/ schemes and
disseminate best practices through grass-root level programs for farmers.

Presiding over a meeting of Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) at SBP, Karachi today, he
said the relevant federal & provincial government departments, farmers’ representatives and other players in
value chain also need to create credit absorption capacity of farmers through adoption of best modern farming
practices, development of storage & marketing systems and resolution of other real side issues.

He said that heavy rains of 2011 and devastating floods in 2010 have greatly affected the national
economy in general and agriculture sector in particular. The credit requirements of farmers have also increased
significantly besides adjustment of existing agricultural loans, he said, adding that agriculture remains the
mainstay with a contribution of more than 21% to the GDP and around 60% of the population depends on
agriculture related activities for its livelihood.

SBP Governor said that banks need to develop a comprehensive agricultural finance policy for
settlement, rescheduling & restructuring of loans of the affected borrowers in addition to providing fresh
credits for the rehabilitation and revival of the economic activities in the affected areas. ‘The federal &
provincial governments would also need to initiate support & relief packages for the affected areas’, he added.

Mr. Anwar said that in order to ensure timely and quick loan disbursement to help the agriculture
sector and revival of economic activities in the affected areas, SBP in collaboration with banks has taken a
number of initiatives including Refinance Scheme at discounted rates of 8% coupled with Credit Guarantee
Scheme for loss sharing of banks up to 40%. ‘Banks were also allowed to restructure the existing loans and
write-offs in cases where the recovery of loans is not possible’, Mr. Anwar added.

He said the crop loan insurance scheme introduced by the government for production loans for five
major crops has also supported the sector whereby claims of around Rs 800 million (including around Rs 550
million of the borrowers of ZTBL) have been settled by insurance companies in 2010 and 2011.

He pointed out that agricultural credit is highly skewed towards farm sector i.e. around 68% whereas
credit to non form sector including livestock sector is only 32% as compared with its contribution of 55% to
agriculture GDP.

The SBP Governor announced the setting up of an Implementation Committee to ensure timely
implementation of the action plan prepared by the ACAC Special Committee, constituted in December, 2010.
This Implementation Committee will be headed by the Executive Director, State Bank of Pakistan and include
members from provincial agricultural departments, farmers representatives, Pakistan Banks Association (PBA),

Groups of SBP-BSC offices to get feedback on the implementation strategy and ensure timely implementation of
decisions/ recommendations. The update on the progress of implementation would be made to the ACAC in its

SBP to facilitate general public in obtaining fresh
currency notes during Ramazan-ul-Mubarak

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to fully utilize the large network of over
10,000 branches of commercial banks for distribution of fresh currency notes to the general
public during the holy month of Ramazan-ul-Mubarak, 2012.

For this purpose, the SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) has made elaborate
arrangements for the supply of adequate quantity of fresh currency notes particularly of small
denominations (Rs.10/- to Rs.100/) to commercial banks depending upon their branch network.

The branches of commercial banks will issue only one packet each of Rs. 10/- and Rs. 20/ -
per person to the visiting general public / account holders from 1* August, 2012 till the last
working day before Eid-ul-Fitr 2012 (or until the stock ends) on presentation of original
Computerized National Identity Card along-with the photocopy of it for record. Banks’
branches, however, may also issue a maximum of 5 packets each of Rs.10/- & Rs.20/-
denomination fresh notes to their corporate clients on receipt of request on the company’s
letter head duly signed by the authorized representative.

With the view to redressing the grievances of general public, if any, in obtaining fresh
currency notes from commercial banks, the SBP BSC has established a Help Desk which may be
contacted at the telephone numbers 021-32455470 and 021-32455454. Complaints may also
be lodged at the following email address: freshnotes@sbp.org.pk or with the Chief
Spokesperson, State Bank of Pakistan, at his email address: syed.wasimuddin@sbp.org.pk

The SBP BSC has put in place a mechanism for penalizing the banks in case any
irregularity is committed by them in issuance of fresh currency notes. Penalty will also be
imposed on banks found violating SBP instructions with regard to issuance of notes to the
general public during the holy month of Ramazan-ul-Mubarak, 2012.

Economy showing signs of modest improvement:

SBP Second Quarterly Report

‘Half way into FY12, the economy is showing signs of a modest improvement. Preliminary data
indicates that the commodity producing sector, especially agriculture, is doing better than expected.
Services also seem well-placed to gain from robust retail trade activities; transportation; and increased
profitability of the banking sector,’ says State Bank’s Second Quarterly Report for the fiscal year 2011-12
on the State of the Economy released today.

The Report, which covers the period from July to December FY12, said the ample availability of
key staple crops and less than anticipated supply disruptions due to floods, played a key role in
containing inflationary pressures during the period under review.

However, it pointed out that despite these positive developments, risks to macro-economic
stability have, nevertheless, increased. ‘Specifically, the position of the external sector weakened at a
rate faster than expected; and the fall in financial and capital inflows exerted pressure both on SBP’s
foreign exchange reserves and on the Pak Rupee,’ it said, adding that this, along with the pickup in
government borrowing from SBP, complicated liquidity management. Finally, energy shortages
continued to plague production activities, especially in the industrial sector, it added.

‘Developments during H1-FY12 indicate that risks to macroeconomic stability are stemming
from the external sector and the continued weaknesses on the fiscal side,’ it said and added that in
terms of the real sector, there has been some improvement since the publication of SBP’s Annual Report
in December 2011. ‘The economy is still expected to grow in the range of 3 to 4 percent. Inflationary
outlook has improved slightly on account of supply side factors (food). It is expected that FY12 inflation
will fall within the range of 11.0 to 12.0 percent, with a bias towards the lower boundary,’ the Report
added.

It said that in spite the lower fiscal deficit during H1-FY12, containing the overall fiscal deficit to
its revised target of 4.7 percent of GDP seems to be challenging. Quarterly data for previous years has
shown that the deficit remains relatively higher in the second half of the year, it said, adding that the
achievement of the revised fiscal deficit is dependent on the realization of: (1) the envisaged surpluses
from provincial governments, which are likely to be lower than expected; (2) the non-tax revenues,
which depend on inflows into the Coalition Support Fund, and the auction of 3G licenses; and (3) strict
control over expenditures.

According to the Report, the burden of financing this deficit will fall on the banking system,
specifically on commercial banks. Other than growing concerns about the supply of loan-able funds for
the private sector, renewed government borrowing from SBP entails rising inflationary expectations in
the economy, it said, adding that on external front, although the current account deficit is expected to
be in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent of GDP, there is an upward bias to this prediction. ‘Given the fall in
financial and capital inflows, funding this modest current account deficit could be challenging. Market
players are increasingly concerned about whether the envisaged foreign inflows will materialize in time.
This, together with the scheduled repayment of IMF loans (USS 1.1 billion) during H2-FY12, may draw
down SBP’s foreign exchange reserves,’ the Report added.

SBP allows Microfinance Providers to mobilize

funding from non-bank sources/capital market

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed microfinance providers (MFPs) to mobilize funding
from non-bank sources/capital market under the Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility (MCGF) by
issuing revised Guidelines on MCGF today to all banks/ Development Finance Institutions (DFls)/
Microfinance Banks (MFBs).

The revised Guidelines on MCGF stressed upon the MFBs/MEFls to explore other local currency
funding opportunities such as raising capital by issuance of Redeemable Capital from capital market,
thereby increasing funding availability and diversification of sources.

SBP has been encouraging the viable microfinance providers, both the Microfinance Banks
(MFBs) and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), to mobilize local currency funding from banks/
Development Finance Institutions (DFls) for lending to microfinance borrowers to enhance microfinance
outreach. However, it has been observed that funding requirements of MFBs/MFls have been partially
met by banks / DFls. The revised guidelines have been issued with a view to further easing the funding
constraints of the microfinance sector.

SBP has advised all banks/DFIs/MFPs to finalize their funding deals under the MCGF and submit
their cases to SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) for issuance of Guarantee as per procedure
envisaged in the revised Guidelines on MCGF.

It may be recalled that the Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility is a credit enhancement facility
to attract long-term and market-based finance for microfinance institutions. MCGF was launched by
the State Bank in December 2008 with £10 million funding support from the UK Department for
International Development (DFID) under the £50 million Financial Inclusion Program (FIP) which is being
managed by SBP.

The facility offers 25% first loss or 40 percent partial guarantee (pari passu) coverage to
Banks. The facility is focused on market development and has significantly helped in reducing the risk-
perception of banks towards the microfinance sector, thus introducing poor borrowers to mainstream
financial institutions.

The facility has successfully overcome some funding constraints of the microfinance providers as
15 guarantees have so far been issued mobilizing private capital of over Rs.4 billion from commercial
banks for onward lending to around 200,000 new poor and low-income borrowers. As such the facility is
now well positioned to mobilize non-bank financing from capital market and further diversifying
sources of financing for micro borrowers.

The revised Guidelines on MCGF have been issued by SBP through AC&MFD’s Circular No. 3
dated the 21* June, 2012. This supersedes all earlier instructions/guidelines issued in this regard, the

Circular added.

E-banking transactions surge by 6.47%
to Rs. 6,871 bn in third quarter

The volume and value of overall e-banking transactions in the country surged by 5.9 and 6.47
percent to reach at 70.9 million and Rs. 6,871 billion respectively during the third quarter of the current
fiscal year (FY12) compared to the preceding quarter, says the State Bank of Pakistan’s Payment Systems
Quarterly Review for the 3 Quarter of FY12 released today.

According to the Review, the Payment Systems infrastructure in Pakistan continued to show an
upward growth trend as 203 more Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were added during the quarter
under-review bringing the total number of ATMs in the country to 5,612 whereas 269 more bank
branches were upgraded to Real-Time Online Branches (RTOB). Currently, 9,174 bank branches are
offering RTOB services out of total of 10,009 bank branches across the country, it added.

Elaborating the year-on-year (YoY) growth trend, the Review said that the volume and value of
e-banking transactions grew by 19 and 18 percent respectively in January- March 2012 quarter as
compared to the same period of last fiscal year (i.e. January-March 2011). E-banking infrastructure in
terms of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Real Times Online Branches (RTOB) also showed strong
year-on-year growth as the number of ATMs increased by 13 percent and the number of RTOB grew by
29 percent on year-on-year basis, it added.

It said the number of plastic cards also increased by 9.47 percent during January-March 2012
quarter compared to the numbers recorded in the preceding quarter. By the end of quarter under-
review, there were 16.7 million plastic cards circulating in the country, the Review added.

The Review said that the overall number of ATM transactions showed an increase of 5.6 percent
and the value increased by 8.6 percent. The average value per ATM transaction stands at Rs. 9,828, it
said and added that the share of ATM transactions in total e-banking transactions in terms of volume
and value worked out to 59.6 percent and 6.0 percent respectively.

The number of Real Time Online Branches (RTOB) transactions also increased by 6.15 percent
during January- March 2012 quarter whereas the value of transactions increased by 6.14 percent as
compared to the previous quarter. The volume and value of transactions through Point of Sale (POS)
terminals stood at 4.5 million and Rs. 21.2 billion respectively during the quarter under-review depicting
7.0 and 8.3 percent growth respectively as compared to the figures reported in the previous quarter, it
added.

The Review said that although the volume of large-value payments through Real Time Gross
Settlement System (RTGS) increased by 8.8 percent, the value of transactions, however, recorded a
decline of 8.2 percent. The decrease is due to decline in securities settlement value from Rs. 18.7 trillion
to Rs. 16.1 trillion, it said, adding that despite the above decline, the major portion of RTGS transactions
continued to be in respect of settlements against securities followed by Interbank Funds Transfers and
settlement of retail cheques through multilateral clearing contributing 57.7, 31.5 and 10.8 percent
respectively.

State Bank asks banks to submit new prudential
returns for effective monitoring of all kinds of risks

The Stat Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a set of prudential returns/statements for banks
to enable it to effectively monitor and assess the risks posed by their relationship with the associated
undertakings.

The new prudential returns/ statements introduced for all banks incorporated in Pakistan
include (A) Details of related parties; (B) Details of exposures to and from related parties; (C) Details of
related party dealings and transactions; (D) Details of equity exposures; (E) Details of capital adequacy of
subsidiaries; and (F) Latest available financial statements of subsidiaries and associates (as defined in the
IAS-28).

SBP has advised all banks incorporated in Pakistan to submit these returns/statements on half
yearly basis, effective from half year ending June 30, 2012 and onward. These returns should reach the
Banking Surveillance Department of the SBP within 45 days of the close of each half year ending June 30
and December 31. However, banks may submit the returns for half-year ending June 30, 2012 within 45
days from the date of BSD Circular 2 i.e. September 13, 2012.

It may be pointed out that in addition to the risks that banks generally carry on their books, they
are also exposed to risks arising out of their relationship with associated undertakings. One of the Core
Principles of Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also
necessitates consolidated supervision of banks, covering all risks, whether they are carried on their own
books or on the books of associates. It is, therefore, imperative to monitor and assess the risks posed by

such relationships.

SBP makes mandatory for all banks to install at least
one ATM while opening new branch from next year

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has made it mandatory for all banks operating in the
country to add at least one Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in their network while opening a
new branch in a Calendar Year (CY) from next year.

This directive has been issued to banks with a view to improving the coverage ratio of
ATMs (the number of ATMs per branch) and to meet the minimum international standards.

Effective from CY 2013 onwards, all banks shall add one ATM in their network against
each new branch to be opened in a CY, according to BPRD Circular No. 03 issued to the
Presidents/Chief Executives of all banks today.

The banks having less than 1:1 ATM per branch ratio shall cover their existing gap in 5
years starting from CY 2013 @ 20% each year. For this purpose, all the banks shall submit a five
year plan to SBP latest by November 30, 2012. The progress in this regard would be reported to
SBP on quarterly basis.

Non-compliance of these directives would make the concerned bank(s) ineligible for
future branch expansion in addition to any other appropriate penal action under the relevant
law.

To address operational problems being currently faced by banks relating to ATMs,
separate instructions would shortly be issued by the Payment Systems Department of the State
Bank of Pakistan, the Circular added.

State Bank developing new five-year strategic plan
for Islamic banking industry: Kazi Abdul Muktadir

Kazi Abdul Muktadir, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said the central
bank is developing a new five-year (2013-17) strategic plan for Islamic banking industry.

‘The new plan will set the strategic direction for the Islamic banking industry. This would
define the strategies and action plans to move the industry to the next level of growth and SBP
would expect active and meaningful involvement of the industry in development of the plan,’ Mr.
Muktadir said while delivering his keynote address on ‘Islamic Finance in Pakistan - Where We
Stand and The Way Forward’ at the Islamic Finance News (IFN) Roadshow — 2012 at SBP Learning
Resource Centre (LRC), Karachi today.

He said the Islamic finance industry is likely to increase its share in the banking system to 15
percent during next five years. Growing from scratch in 2002, he said that Islamic banking now constitutes
over 8 percent of the country’s banking system with a network of 964 branches and over 500 windows across the
country. ‘Encouragingly, the sustained growth of Islamic banking in the country during the last
decade has also started catalyzing growth and development of Islamic capital markets, Mutual
funds and Takaful companies etc. Presently, we have 5 Takaful operators, about 30 Islamic mutual
funds,’ he added.

Mr. Muktadir disclosed that the State Bank is also developing a comprehensive Shariah
Governance framework to further strengthen the Shariah governance in Islamic Banking Institutions
(IBIs) and added that the framework will explicitly define the roles and responsibilities of different
organs of IBls including the Board of Directors, Shariah Advisors/Committees and Executive
Management for ensuring Shariah compliance.

He said the State Bank has developed a comprehensive profit distribution & pool
management framework in consultation with the industry and added that the framework will be
issued most probably within this month.

Mr. Muktadir said that sovereign Sukuk of Rs.369 billion (USD 4 billion approx) were issued
during the last two years that have largely addressed the liquidity management issue of the Islamic
banking industry. ‘The regular issuance of the Sukuk, almost on quarterly basis, has improved
market confidence and tradability of the Sukuk,’ he added.

He said that the State Bank has been taking initiatives to strengthen the legal, regulatory
and Shariah compliance framework, create awareness amongst the masses and build the Islamic
banking industry’s Human Resource capacity.

Mr. Muktadir said that SBP will soon be launching a mass media campaign to create
awareness about Islamic banking. ‘The campaign we believe will be instrumental in enhancing
public awareness and would give further boost to the growth momentum of Islamic banking
industry,’ he added.

SBP Governor stresses upon banks to give
top priority to SME banking

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has stressed upon the banks to
give top most priority to SME banking with a view to ensuring uninterrupted flow of
financial access to SME sector in the country.

Speaking at the signing ceremony of the Project Document between the State Bank of
Pakistan and Bank Alfalah under the DFID-funded Financial Inclusion Programme (FIP) at
SBP, Karachi today, he said the role of banks, especially of mid-tier banks, is crucial to
ensure unhindered flow of financial resources to the SME sector which is the engine of
economic growth in Pakistan, ‘Though many banks in the market are trying to improve their
market position in order to serve the sector more effectively, the current level of SME finance
as well as an overall level of SMEs’ access to banking services remain unsatisfactory, and as
such call for more serious efforts on part of the banks,’ SBP Governor added.

Mr. Anwar said that SME financing is very close to his heart due to its key significant
contribution in the economic development of Pakistan. ‘The SME sector plays an important
role in employment generation, poverty alleviation, and equitable distribution of resources
and is the engine of growth,” he added.

He pointed out there are 3.2 million economic establishments, of which 99% are SMEs, and
SME sector represents over 90% of all enterprises and employs 75% of the non-agricultural
workforce and contributes 30% towards the national GDP. ‘However, despite its strong
contribution in employment generation, exports, and national income, the SME sector is
severely constrained in access to finance which is crucial for its growth,’ he added. SBP
Governor advised the banks to study the international examples of successful SME banking
models which include Retail-based Model for Mass SME, Relationship-based banking,
Advisory-based lending services, Segment-based Model, and Supply-chain linked Model.

Regrettably, he said that despite its immense significance and potential, the SME sector in
Pakistan remains largely financially excluded, the current level of financing facilities to this
sector stand at Rs. 253 billion, constituting only 7% of the banks’ total advances.

Mr. Anwar said that with the SBP- Bank Alfalah and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
nexus, and the generosity of DFID, we can have more joint ventures of this sort in the future
that would lead to a sustainable, sound and integrated financial system, characterized with
ready access to finance, diversified loan portfolio and extended outreach to SMEs.

He said the State Bank, under the DFID-funded “Financial Inclusion Programme (FIP) will
provide funding support to Bank Alfalah (BAF) in undertaking the IFC SME Advisory
Project. ‘The main objective of the project is to create a symbolic podium which can position
Bank Alafalah to cater to the financing needs of the SME sector including the S and M
segments through a holistic banking and advisory services solution,’ he added.

financial culture in the country: Yaseen Anwar

The steps taken by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to promote financial literacy & inclusion and
capacity building of the banking sector professionals will be highly useful in creating a professional,
sound and vibrant financial culture in the country.

This was stated by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar while addressing the

organized by CFA Association of Pakistan at a local hotel in Karachi last night. ‘The State Bank looks
forward to working with you and the whole community towards achieving our shared goals of economic
growth and social prosperity,’ he added.

He said the SBP has been on the forefront in promoting sound corporate governance
practices and fair competition in the banking sector by introducing various reforms and prudential
regulations. The SBP has implemented a comprehensive corporate governance regime for the banks,
which is supported by a robust legal and regulatory framework, risk-based supervision and detailed
banking sector reforms, notably, privatization, liberalization and consolidation of banks.

‘The measures taken by SBP have enabled the corporate governance regime for banks and
its different elements are not only compatible with international best principles but are also parallel
with most other emerging economies,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said the SBP regularly reviews the international regulatory standards and best
practices issued by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and
other multilateral agencies and standard setting bodies and assesses them for their possible
implementation in its banking system.

He said that the SBP’s regulatory approach towards promoting and strengthening of

governance culture in the banking sector that has transformed them into healthy and profitable
financial institutions.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has categorically denied reports appearing in a section of the
press today (January 20, 2012) which stated that it (SBP) opposed the debt swap deal with commercial

The State Bank Spokesman today said that the issue of debt swap deal with commercial banks

Therefore, the question of SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar conveying his reservations about the

The Spokesman regretted the linkage of the reports between the so-called SBP comments and

presented the proposed debt swap deal as a solution to the circular debt. The SBP Spokesman said that
since the matter regarding the debt swap deal was never discussed in the meeting of Monetary and

fiscal year 2012-13 (FY13), showing an impressive growth of 9.89 percent or $108.40 million
when compared with $1,096.31 million received during the same month of the last fiscal year

GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman) and EU countries amounted to
$349.66 million, $240.54 million, $215.30 million, $148.49 million, $140.36 million and $30.83

during the last month amounted to $79.53 million as against $84.37million received in the
same month of the last fiscal year (FY12).

The continued impressive growth in workers’ remittances is the result of the efforts
made by Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) in collaboration with other stakeholders to
facilitate both Overseas Pakistanis and their families back home. Since its inception, PRI has
taken a number of steps to enhance the flow of remittances through formal channels which
include: (a) preparation of national strategies on remittances (b) taking all necessary steps to
implement the overall strategy (c) playing the advisory role for financial sector in terms of
preparing a business case, relationship building with overseas correspondents, creating
separate efficient remittance payment highways and (d) becoming a national focal point for
overseas Pakistanis through round the clock call centre (021-111-222-774) with toll free lines,

SBP warns general public about fraudulent
prize schemes in foreign currency

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has warned the general public not to be
misled by fraudulent activities/schemes launched by some unscrupulous
elements informing it about the winning of heavy cash prizes in foreign
currency.

It has come to the notice of the State Bank that the members of the general
public are being approached through telephone calls/web mail
service/SMS/Surface mail informing them that they have won heavy cash
prizes in foreign currency.

The fraudulent groups are providing fabricated application form of Foreign
Exchange Department, State Bank of Pakistan to carry out remittance facility
on behalf of prospective beneficiaries. They also demand some initial
clearance dues from the targeted persons which, they falsely claim, are to be
deposited to the Ministry of Finance in terms of cost of Fund Registration
Charges Fee. They are also fraudulently using names of the Foreign
Missions/Diplomats, Corporates, Foreign Exchange Department, SBP and
fake email addresses to portray their genuineness.

Neither any such application form has been devised by SBP nor it has any
connection with such schemes. SBP has once again advised the members of
the general public to be careful and do not pay any heed to such fraudulent
schemes.

For further clarification in respect of the above fraudulent schemes, if any,
the general public is advised to contact the Exchange Policy Department,
State Bank of Pakistan, I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi at phone number 021-
99212459 & Fax number 021-99212527.

SBP issues instructions to improve transparency and bring
standardization in IBls Profit & Loss distribution policies and practices

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued detailed instructions for Profit & Loss Distribution and
Pool Management in Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) in order to improve transparency and
disclosures and bring standardization in IBls’ profit and loss distribution policies and practices.

With the issuance of these instructions, which are applicable with immediate effect, Para IV of
annexure-ll of IBD Circular No. 2 of 2008 stands withdrawn. Further, the provisions of BPRD Circular
No. 7 of 2008 regarding minimum rate of return on savings deposits as amended from time to time
shall no more be applicable on Islamic Banking Institutions.

Failure to comply with SBP instructions shall invoke penal action under the provisions of Banking
Companies Ordinance, 1962, says IBD Circular No.3 of 2012 issued to the Presidents/Chief Executives
of all Islamic banks and all conventional banks having Islamic banking branches today.

It may be pointed out that the peculiar nature of relationship between the depositors and Islamic
banking institutions (IBIs) where income earned by the IBI has a direct impact on depositors’ return;
there was a need for Islamic banking industry to have well defined, transparent and standardized
policies and practices for profit & loss computation and distribution.

As per SBP instructions, each pool of deposit established by IBIs would act like a virtual enterprise
having explicitly demarcated sources of funds, ownership of specific assets and income and
expenses. The profit earned on the financing and investments made through such pool of deposits
will be shared between IBIs and the depositors as per pre-agreed profit sharing ratio. In case of loss,
the same will be borne by the depositors in proportion of their investments unless caused by the
negligence and misconduct by the IBls in managing the depositors’ funds.

SBP’s detailed instructions for Profit & Loss distribution are as under:
CREATION OF POOLS

1.1. IBIs shall have a well-defined profit and loss distribution and pool management framework for
creation of one or more pools of assets to be financed by different types of Mudaraba-based
(individual, corporate or financial institutions) deposits. The framework shall interalia specify
the objectives, investment strategy, and risk characteristics of each pool. It shall also explicitly
define the basis for (i) allocating different types of deposits to different pools (ii) assigning
weightages to each deposit category of a particular pool. The framework shall be approved by
the Shariah Advisor and Board of Directors (BOD) of the IBI and a duly approved copy of the
same shall be submitted to Islamic Banking Department, SBP within three months of issuance
of these instructions. Further, changes (if any), warranted in the framework shall also be

Over 800,000 Branchless Banking accounts
have been opened: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has disclosed that over 800,000
Branchless Banking accounts have so far been opened while the average number of transactions per day
is around 180,000 and the average ticket size per transaction stands at Rs 3,700.

Speaking at a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing ceremony held between the State
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) at a local hotel in Karachi
today, he said that the agent network under Branchless Banking umbrella has exceeded 20,000 agents,
who have helped to channelize 50 million financial transactions worth more than Rs 190 billion while the
number of bank branches at present is only ten thousand (10,000), he said, adding that these agents
outlets/touch points are spread across several cities, towns and smaller villages in Pakistan.

The SBP Governor said that the Branchless Banking has also proved to be an effective
instrument in channelizing the Government to Persons (G2P) payments in trying times like serving
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and the people affected by devastating floods and rains for the last
two years. The Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) beneficiaries are also being served effectively
through this mechanism, he said, adding that this channel is expected to continue playing an important
role towards promotion of financial inclusion and the management of Government to Person (G2P)
programs like salary disbursements, pensions, BISP, Watan Cards, Pakistan Cards and tax collection
services, etc. ‘The existing Branchless Banking deployments can cater to the needs of over 10 million
potential beneficiaries of G2P payments in Pakistan’, he added.

Mr. Anwar said the technology has made it possible for banking industry to offer a wide menu of
services such as e-Banking, Branchless/Mobile Banking, Electronic Clearing Systems, Electronic Funds
Transfer, Smart Cards, plastic cards of various forms etc.

Appreciating the initiatives of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the Ministry of
Information Technology (MOIT) to promote and develop the emerging field of branchless and mobile
banking in the country, he said that it is also heartening to note that PTA is also playing an important
role by encouraging it’s regulatees to play their due part in provision of smooth and efficient Branchless
Banking services.

‘It should be a matter of great comfort and satisfaction for banking and telecom industries that
their respective regulators i.e. SBP and PTA share the vision and working in tandem to provide an
enabling regulatory environment for provision of mobile / branchless banking services’, SBP Governor
added.

Keeping in view the importance of interconnectivity for promotion of Branchless / Mobile
banking, he said that SBP and PTA are working very closely in developing an appropriate Regulatory
framework for Third Party Solution Provider (TPSP). Currently, a joint regulatory Committee of SBP and
PTA is considering issuance of Regulations for TPSP, he said, adding that the core objective of TPSP

Pakistan holds enormous potential for economic
growth despite challenges: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that Pakistan holds
enormous potential for economic growth. ‘I am, personally, optimistic about the country’s future, and
confident that our economic managers — who have steered the country through much choppier seas —
will guide this resilient economy to the path of stability and prosperity,’ he added.

Delivering his key-note address on “The State of Pakistan’s Economy” at a seminar organized by
the Management Association of Pakistan (MAP) at a local hotel in Lahore today, he emphasised that our
economy’s resilience may well be unparalleled as we have survived two major floods; one catastrophic
earthquake; a war on one border; and a balance of payments crisis — all in the past decade without any
bouts of hyperinflation, a run on bank deposits or a deep recession. ‘This only goes to show the
enormous potential for growth that the country holds,’ he added.

He said that while Pakistan’s economy is going through some testing times, the challenge in
front of us can scarcely be classified as daunting. ‘Our twin deficits are, in my opinion, the most
significant challenge at the moment. Even then, it is not the size that’s the problem; it’s the situation.
And unlike the problems that engulf the economies of the West, we know precisely what needs to be
done. In that regard, we are extremely fortunate,’ SBP Governor added.

Mr. Anwar said: ‘we know what our problems are. Unlike many other countries, the solutions to
our problems are straightforward. All they require is a good measure of willpower and the
determination to see reforms through these interesting and challenging times.’

He said that despite the fiscal deficit, the country’s debt to GDP ratio has not increased
substantially; in fact, it has declined in the last three years. ‘To put this in perspective, Pakistan’s debt to
GDP ratio is half that of most European countries and one-third that of Japan, he said, adding that most
of the country’s debt is denominated in rupees and the external debt is long-term in nature. Thus, |
believe there is absolutely no chance that Pakistan will be facing a Greece-like debt crisis anytime in the
near future,’ Mr. Anwar added.

SBP Governor said that the resilience of the economy manifested itself in the pace of recovery
that was witnessed after the flooding in Sindh in the early part of FY12. The improvement in food
supplies has already dampened food inflation, which has been edging down continuously, he said,
adding that this is especially good news for the lower strata of society, which spends roughly half of its
income on food. ‘Headline inflation has followed suit and fell to less than ten percent for the first time in
two years,’ he said.

Mr. Anwar said that our textile and sugar industries are expected to do well this year and added
that construction activity has also picked up with support from the rise in remittances; a growing
population; and the initiation of public sector development projects.

He pointed out that growth across the real sector has been constrained significantly by our
energy problems. However, the government is very well informed about the energy situation and has
been taking steps to alleviate the problem, he said, adding that such step was the debt swap that was
recently conducted to free up liquidity for companies across the energy sector, increase power
generation and reduce the level of circular debt in the energy sector.

SBP aims to provide basic banking services
to every adult in Pakistan: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said the central bank aims to
provide basic banking services to every adult and bankable citizen in Pakistan. ‘As a large portion of
our population has access to mobile phones, we feel that if a workable partnership between the
banking and telecom sectors continues, we shall see our dreams come true,’ he added.

Delivering his keynote address at the 5” International Conference on Mobile Banking in
Pakistan at a local hotel in Karachi today, he said that mobile phone subscription has seen an
explosive growth in Pakistan — total subscription now reaches to 112 million customers in all income
segments of the society, and growth continues rapidly.

He, however, observed that banking accounts are owned by approximately 25 million
customers, in a population of 180 million, largely belonging to high income segments while there
are about 7 million borrowers. He pointed out that Pakistan has one of the lowest financial
penetration levels in the world with 56% of the adult population totally excluded, and another 32%
informally served.

Mr. Anwar said that SBP will continue to play its role in promoting an environment which is
conducive for financial innovation. ‘At the macro level, we will continue to work with the industry
and the other regulators to promote a sound, safe, efficient and inclusive mobile commerce
ecosystem,’ he added.

He said: ‘On this front, we are already working closely with Pakistan Telecommunication
Authority (PTA) and have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for enabling the
Interoperability Framework where all banks and telecom companies can join hands to serve the
customers. We are also in the final stages of formulating the regulatory framework for
interoperable mobile banking system.’

Interoperable systems are essential to mass adoption of mobile commerce, he said, adding
that at present, financial institutions and telecom companies can choose whatever business model
suits their needs i.e. One-to-One or One-to-Many. ‘Let me assure that all the existing and the
prospective One-to-One or One-to-Many arrangements between banks and the Telcos would not
be affected with the proposed regulatory framework,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said that SBP is keen to work with different stakeholders including financial
institutions, different regulators, private sector, application developers and telecom companies to
provide an enabling environment for the creation of mobile commerce ecosystem in the country.

However, the common challenge is to ensure that all banking transactions, irrespective of
the technology platform, are cost effective, efficient, and pose the lowest risk for the consumers, he
said, adding that this requires close coordination among the stakeholders in the area of regulations
especially monitoring, licensing, provision of technological infrastructure and ensuring maximum
benefits for consumers.

Pakistan not facing any risk in making
IMF repayments: SBP Governor

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar has said that Pakistan
will not face any risk in making repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“We face no risk in being able to make next year's IMF payments from our adequate
reserves,’ he said in a rebuttal to a story published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on
May 29, 2012.

In his letter, published in the WSJ today, he clarified that the decline in our
projected reserves will be partially offset by an increase in remittances which will exceed
$13 billion this fiscal year, and additional foreign direct investment in the pipeline that
includes U.S. company investments in the power sector.

He said that the entry of new foreign banks, increased small- and medium-size
enterprise lending to increase employment, huge potential for the agriculture sector and
the export potential for dairy products as the fourth largest milk producer in the world, and
the development of capital markets to support housing finance are the positive
developments in the country’s economy.

He pointed out that Pakistan's current banking restructuring and our successful
branchless banking strategy is bringing the ""unbanked"" into the banking sector to increase
financial inclusion. The State Bank of Pakistan had stated that gross domestic product is
expected to be closer to 4% this year than the 3% as reported by WSJ, he explained.

‘It would have been nice to see a more positive light on these factors which will, in
my view, be a positive toward alleviating the manageable stresses going forward. I see the
glass half full and am optimistic about the year ahead,’ the Governor’s letter to WSJ said
and added: ‘The article ""Pakistan Bank Sees Financial Challenges"" (World News, May 29)
doesn't fully reflect the economic story I conveyed in my interview with the Journal.’

Separately, he said that despite economic challenges, Pakistan is not facing a
situation which requires emergency external assistance. The fiscal deficit and the lack of
external financing will continue to challenge Pakistan, especially the central bank, he said.
‘Let me assure you that Pakistan will not stumble into a situation that requires emergency
external assistance,’ he added.

Dispelling the impression created by some foreign and local media reports
regarding pressures on the country’s foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate, the
SBP Governor said: ‘It will be challenging, but manageable.’ He pointed out that like most
other central banks, SBP only undertakes calibrated interventions to diffuse volatility as
appropriate. In recent weeks, the movement in the exchange rate has been somewhat

State Bank gains international recognition for its
regulatory role in microfinance and branchless banking

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has gained international recognition for its regulatory role in
microfinance and branchless banking by creating an enabling environment for their
development in Pakistan. The world-renowned newspaper, Financial Times and the World Bank
have praised SBP for its innovative approaches in expanding the access to financial services for

the unbanked and underserved population of the country.

An article published in Financial Times on November 06 says: ‘Pakistan has one of the best
regulatory environments in the world for microfinance and one of the fastest-growing
microfinance sectors, with 3 million borrowers. It is also one of the most innovative places in
the world for mobile banking services, partly due to the State Bank of Pakistan’s moves to

encourage the market’.

The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) of the World Bank in its recent publication
has also highlighted Pakistan as the fastest growing branchless banking market in the world and

a laboratory of innovation.

SBP has been playing a leading role while working closely with the industry through various
policy and strategic initiatives to transform the financial market into an equitable system of
efficient market-based financial services to the hitherto excluded poor and marginalized
segments of the society. It may be mentioned here that the SBP has moved beyond its
traditional role for modernizing the market infrastructure and improving risk management
framework for microfinance industry. In particular, SBP has invested substantially for
establishing microfinance-specific Credit Bureau, launching nation-wide Financial Literacy
Program, carrying out various market surveys and studies, transforming Microfinance Banks

(MEBs), and channeling Rs. 6 billion commercial funding for MFBs through credit enhancement

Financial Literacy Program to serve the interests of
all financial sector stakeholders: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said the Nationwide Financial Literacy Program
(NFLP) will work towards improving financial inclusion and also serve the interests of all financial sector
stakeholders.

Delivering his key-note address at the launching ceremony of the Program at SBP Learning Resource
Centre, Karachi today, he said it will initially impart basic financial literacy to poor and marginalized people of
Pakistan. He said the NFLP pilot will impart financial education and awareness on six personal finance themes that
include budgeting, savings, investments, debt management, financial products, branchless banking and consumer
rights & responsibilities to about 50,000 beneficiaries from low income strata.

Pakistan’s first-ever Nationwide Financial Literacy Program (NFLP) has been launched with the support
and collaboration of Asian Development Bank (ADB), Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA), Pakistan Microfinance
Network (PMN), Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) and Bearing Point.

He said the program has been developed after the Financial Literacy Gap Assessment Survey of
beneficiaries. ‘The survey has been helpful in development and adaptation of curriculum and dissemination
strategy. The curriculum will also be translated into national and main regional languages including Urdu, Sindhi,
Punjabi, Pushto and Balochi,’ he added.

SBP Governor said that the Program is financed under the ADB-funded Improving Access to Financial
Services Fund (IAFSF) and implemented under the oversight of the IAFSF Committee which has representation
from SBP, Pakistan Banks’ Association, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, Pakistan Microfinance Network,
education sector, and the ADB. Upon completion of the pilot phase, an impact assessment of the pilot will be
conducted by a third party, he said, adding that based on the experience and assessment of the pilot, the program
will be scaled-up to target more than half a million beneficiaries all over the country.

Mr. Anwar said that in addition to focused training sessions of beneficiaries, the dissemination strategy
involves street theatres, board games, comic strips, activity-based competitions, website and media campaigns to
reach out the masses on a larger scale. The training sessions will be sourced from banks, Microfinance Banks
(MFBs) and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) based on their interest and pre-defined qualification criteria, he said
and added that in order to encourage and incentivize participation from partners, professional fees and out of
pocket expenses of partners will be reimbursed from the program budget.

‘Besides involvement of local institutions, the project has formed international partnerships with
international financial education programs including Microfinance Opportunities, Finmark Trust, Association of
Microfinance Institutions of Uganda (AMFIU), Sewa Bank, Microfinance Innovation Centre for Resource and
Alternatives (MICRA), World Bank Institute, Aflatoun, and others,’ Mr. Anwar added.

SBP Governor said that consumer protection and financial education should be vital components of any
financial inclusion initiative. It is now clear that policies which focus entirely on changing the supply of financial
products and services can leave consumers ill-informed, vulnerable and not willing to participate in financial
markets, he said, adding that focus of financial literacy program should be broader than financial inclusion. ‘It
should aim to increase consumer awareness about their rights, obligations and mechanisms for recourse to build a
fair, inclusive and robust financial sector,’ he emphasised.

SBP DEPUTY GOVERNOR OUTLINES FOUR KEY
ASPECTS FOR D-8 CENTRAL BANKS’ COOPERATION

Mr. Kazi Abdul Muktadir, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has outlined four
key aspects for D-8 central banks’ cooperation for promoting inclusive economic growth

amongst the D-8 countries.

In his opening remarks at a workshop on ""Central Banks Monetary and Financial
Cooperation for Promoting Inclusive Economic Growth in D-8 countries"" at a local hotel in
Islamabad today, he said that we need to deliberate on sustaining growth in the New Economic

Order and enhancing cooperation through trade and capital inflows among the D-8 countries.

He said the D-8 economies have witnessed remarkable growth despite slow recovery in
the global economy. ‘As the D-8 economies accelerate to a new phase, it is critical for central
banks to work towards deeper economic and financial integration through sound monetary
policies and macroeconomic management. However, regional economic and financial integration
should be based on greater exchange rate flexibility, freer capital mobility, transparent rules and

regulations’, Mr. Abdul Muktadir added.

He said that sustainability of economic growth can only be ensured through incentives to
encourage investment in innovation and technology, and promotion of entrepreneurship.
‘Increased cooperation and deeper economic integration will enable D-8 countries to respond

effectively to global challenges,’ SBP Deputy Governor added.

Stressing the need for cooperation to promote innovative Financial Inclusion Policies in
the D-8 countries, he said that developing dynamic risk management framework and innovative
financial structures can help the banking industry to exploit the huge potential of micro, small

and medium enterprises.

Currency Swap Arrangement with
Turkey becomes operational from today: SBP

 

The three-year bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement (CSA) between the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) and the Central Bank of Republic of Turkey (CBRT) amounting to US$ 1 billion in equivalent local
currencies is being implemented from today and SBP has issued necessary instructions to banks for
its implementation after due consultations with various stakeholders and completion of operational
formalities with CBRT.

A landmark bilateral CSA was signed between SBP and CBRT by SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar
and CBRT Governor, Mr. Erdem Base in presence of the Presidents of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
and the Republic of Turkey in November last year.

Objectives & Structure of CSA: The objective of the currency swap is to 1) promote bilateral trade
between the two countries in the respective local currencies and 2) any ‘Other’ purpose as mutually
agreed between the two central banks. Since the CSA is a bi-lateral financial transaction, all terms &
conditions apply equally to both countries and the pricing is based on standard market benchmarks
which are widely acceptable in the respective domestic markets.

Implementation Guidelines from SBP: Currency Swap Agreement between the two Central Banks
gives a positive signal to the market on the availability of liquidity of other country’s currency in the
onshore market. The arrangement will augment the pool of liquidity available to finance bilateral trade
between the two countries, supplementing the already available sources of liquidity.

By virtue of this arrangement, SBP will have the ability to draw on the swap line and provide
Turkish Lira (TRY) to banks in Pakistan. Banks will on-lend this liquidity to importers/ exporters
involved in trade denominated in TRY. At maturity, the importer/exporter will repay the foreign currency
to the lending bank, which in turn will repay to the respective central bank.

In order to ensure transparency in determination of market interest rates, the State Bank of

Pakistan has decided to conduct competitive auctions of Turkish Lira (TRY) Loan Facility as under:

— All commercial banks will be allowed to take FE-25 deposits and extend FE-25 loans in Turkish Lira
(TRY) for financing of Imports / Exports in accordance with SBP’s prevailing instructions on FE-25
loans / deposits. Necessary instructions to that effect have been issued vide FE Circular No. 4
dated 04Sep2012.

— Inorder to provide TRY funding to scheduled banks, so that they can on-lend the TRY to importers /
exporters with underlying Trade documents in TRY, SBP will conduct competitive auctions of
Turkish Lira (TRY) Loan Facility using proceeds drawn under the Currency Swap Arrangement with
CBRT.

— Participation in auctions will be dependent on the submission of documentary evidence of Export
or Import bills denominated in TRY, SBP will conduct ‘uniform price’ competitive TRY auctions in 3
and 6 month tenors. All scheduled banks will be eligible to participate in such auctions.

Further details on the utilization of TRY in Pakistan on account of PKR/TRY swap are as follows:

a) Importers with underlying trade documents denominated in TRY: On the maturity date of
the letter of credit (LC), the importer will pay off the overseas supplier by borrowing in TRY.
Assuming borrowing is for 6 months, the importer will save on the rupee cost and after six
months the importer will buy TRY against PKR and pay off the TRY loan. Availability of
onshore TRY financing will encourage importers to open TRY denominated LCs.

b) Exporters with underlying trade documents denominated in TRY: Once the contract is
established, the exporter will borrow in TRY, sell TRY against PKR and utilize PKR for its
local operations. On the maturity date of the contract, the exporter will receive TRY from the
overseas buyer and payoff the TRY loan locally.

All participating banks are expected to educate their customers on the additional option of

denominating their Trade documents in TRY. SBP encourages banks to hold sessions with local Trade

bodies. All importers/ exporters are also requested to contact their respective banks for more details

on how they can borrow Turkish Lira (TRY) liquidity to finance bilateral trade.

(p.a.). Earlier, the exporters were getting the financing under this scheme at 11 per cent p.a.

It has been decided that rate of refinance under the Export Finance Scheme applicable
from September 10, 2012 and onward till further instructions shall be 8.50% p.a. The
commercial banks shall ensure that where financing facilities are extended by them to the
exporters for availing refinance facilities under the Export Finance Scheme, their maximum
margin/spread does not exceed 1% p.a. says IH&SMEFD Circular No. 4 issued to all banks today.

The reimbursement of mark-up rate benefit to exporters, on excess performance under
Part-Il of the Scheme, as specified in SMEFD Circular No.15 dated October 31, 2009, will be
adjusted accordingly keeping in view the revised mark-up rates, the circular added.

The rates of service charges for Participating Financial Institutions (PFls) and rates for
end users under the Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) have also been reduced by 150 basis
points with effect from September 10, 2012. The rates of refinance under LTFF will now be
9.50% for financing up-to 3 years, 8.60% for over 3 years and up-to 5 years and 8.20% for over 5
years and up-to 10 years. Participating Financial Institutions‘(PFls’) spread for these tenors will
be 1.50%, 2.50% and 3.00% respectively. Hence, the end users’ rates for these tenors have now
been reduced to 11.00% from 12.50%, 11.10% from 12.60% and 11.20% from 12.70%
respectively, according to IH&SMEFD Circular No.5.

Similarly, the rates of service charges under the Scheme for Financing Power Plants
Using Renewable Energy have been re-fixed at 8.60% for financing up-to 5 years and 8.20% for
over 5 years and up-to 10 years with effect from September 10, 2012. Banks/DFls will be
allowed to charge 2.50% and 3.00% spread respectively for these tenors. Hence, the end users’
rates for these tenors have now been reduced to 11.10% from 12.60% and 11.20% from 12.70%
respectively, according to IH&SMEFD Circular No.6.

Huge potential exists in global
remittance market for Pakistan: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that there exists a huge
potential in the global remittance market for Pakistan.

Speaking on the occasion of an award distribution ceremony held in recognition of bankers’
commendable services in facilitating home remittances by Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) in Karachi
today, he said that it is quite satisfactory to note that the banks have started to improve their
infrastructure and related systems with a view to offering better remittance services to their customers.

Mr. Anwar observed that the continued impressive growth in workers’ remittances is the result
of the efforts made by SBP and PRI, in collaboration with banks and other stakeholders, to facilitate both
overseas Pakistanis and their families back home. He outlined the steps taken to enhance the flow of
remittances through formal channels which include: (a) preparation and implementation of national
strategy on remittances; (b) playing the advisory role for the financial sector; (c) creating separate
efficient remittance payment highways; and (c) becoming a focal point for overseas Pakistanis through
round-the-clock call centre with toll free lines.

‘We cannot afford to be complacent. We can always learn more from other countries’ best
practices in facilitating remittance flows including end-to-end efficient systems, maximum satisfaction of
both remitters & beneficiaries, highest degree of commitment of the financial sector, and development
of new products and services,’ he added.

He assured full SBP & PRI support in facilitating all efforts of the financial sector towards
achieving the desired objective of maximizing the flow of remittances through formal channels into the
country. ‘Remittances sent home by overseas Pakistani workers crossed the $13 billion mark for the
first time in country’s history during the last fiscal year,’ he added.

SBP Governor distributed the awards amongst banks’ officials in different areas relating to home
remittances including remittances services at branch level both in Pakistan and overseas, processing at
centralized Home Remittance Cells and IT support for swift remittance delivery. The ‘Leading Bank in
Home Remittances Award for the year 2011’ was conferred upon Habib Bank Limited. Forty-five officials
from a number of banks also received individual performance awards for facilitating remittances into
Pakistan. The ceremony was attended, among others, by senior SBP officials and a large number of

bankers.

SBP Deputy Governor stresses upon banks to
promote SMEs through prudent banking solutions

Kazi Abdul Muktadir, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has stressed upon
the banks to promote Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through prudent banking solutions.

‘| would stress the financial industry to break-out of the tendency of lending to
conventionally profitable and relatively safer sectors, and move towards promoting SMEs
through prudent banking solutions, he said in his key-note address on ‘““Engaging the SMEs to
Stabilize Economy” at the 6 SME Banking Conference at a local hotel in Karachi today.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir said that banks need to shift from traditional banking approach
towards SMEs by developing and implementing appropriate credit evaluation techniques, used
globally, such as credit scoring, cash flow & program based lending, ’ he added.

He said that SMEs would greatly benefit the financial institutions themselves as SMEs
will grow into larger corporations, resulting in increased business opportunities for them.
‘Banks need to remember that their industry is only as strong as the underlying economy,’ he
emphasized.

SBP Deputy Governor said there exists strong evidence that SMEs expansion boosts
employment more than large firm growth due to the fact that SMEs are normally more labour
intensive. ‘In Pakistan, the SME sector contributes 30 percent towards the country’s GDP,
employ more than 70 percent of the non-agricultural workforce, accounts for 35 percent of the
value added in the manufacturing industry and generates 25 percent in the export earnings.
The sector has huge potential in generating employment and alleviation of poverty in the
country,’ he added.

Keeping in view the specific business dynamics of the sector, SBP issued specific
Prudential Regulations (PRs) for SMEs in 2003 that greatly helped banks to focus on SME
financing and accordingly align their business strategies, he said and added that these
Prudential Regulations for SMEs do not make it mandatory for banks to require collateral but
allow them to take cash flow generation as the basis for loan approval. ‘We have always been
open to any suggestion from the sector for further improvement and strengthening of these
regulations, he added.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir said the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Small and Rural Enterprises
launched by the State Bank has been highly successful as over 64% of the guarantee limits
allocated to banks have been utilized by them.

SBP to achieve the desired goal of
‘Banking for All’: Kazi Abdul Muktadir

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Kazi Abdul Muktadir has expressed his
resolve to provide banking services to all segments of the society. Addressing the journalists
during his visit to Karachi Press Club this afternoon, he said that with the concerted efforts of

all, we will be able to achieve the desired goal of ‘Banking for All’.

Emphasizing the need for an efficient and thriving banking system, he said that the State Bank is
providing regulatory environment to financial institutions to enhance financial inclusion in the
country. ‘Providing people with access to finance is a challenging task, not just for the central

bank but also for all the stakeholders,’ he observed.

State Bank of Pakistan is trying to make the banking services available at the door step of the
people, he said and added that promoting access to banking services is the corner stone of
SBP’s policy framework. He said the State Bank under its Branch Licencing Policy has made it
compulsory for banks to open at least 20% of their new branches in rural and under-served

areas.

He pointed out that Branchless Banking is helping in reaching out to the low income, unbanked
people through more than 30,000 access points throughout the country. Nearly 30 million
transactions worth Rs.115 billion have been processed during the fourth quarter of the last

fiscal year through branchless banking and the average daily transactions have been reported

SBP decides to implement International

Bank Account Number (IBAN) Standard in Pakistan

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to implement International Bank Account Number
(IBAN) standard in the country with a view to bringing about account code standardization and
efficiency in processing of payments for domestic as well as cross border transactions.

The IBAN guidelines issued by SBP today contain details for IBAN generation, validation and
implementation timelines. These guidelines have been developed in consultation with Pakistan
Banks’ Association (PBA) nominated committee on IBAN. All participants have been advised by
SBP to ensure implementation of IBAN as per given timelines.

According to the guidelines, the IBAN, an international standard (ISO 13616) for identifying
bank accounts across borders and will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, all
banks shall generate and notify IBAN to all their customers by December 2012. In the second
phase, IBAN account numbers will be operationally used (capturing, recognition, processing, validation,
transfer) both for domestic as well as for international financial transactions by June, 2013.

It may be pointed out that IBAN is made up of two components. The first component is
comprised of a country code and check digit and the 2™ component is called Basic Bank
Account Number (BBAN). The check digit mechanism in an IBAN compliant account number will
validate the accuracy of account number at the point of transactions entry at the remitting
institutions (domestic or international).

The benefits of IBAN are as under:

e A bank account standard across Pakistan will bring more efficiency in payment
processing by enabling the payments/clearing systems to electronically validate account
numbers and to decide the route a payment should take without manual intervention.

e Elimination of delays in credit transfers originating from IBAN compliant countries to
Pakistan as same are delayed, sometimes for several days due to manual intervention
required for sending credit transfers to non IBAN compliant account numbers.

e IBAN implementation will help in bringing more efficiency in remittance related
transactions as a significant percentage of these transactions are rejected due to
inaccurate account numbers information. Account validation at remitting institution due
to IBAN’s check digit mechanism will significantly reduce errors related to account
numbers.

The State Bank has asked the banks to generate and issue IBAN to its account holders. Banks
should encourage customers to use/quote their IBAN number in all financial transactions during

SBP enhances coverage & quality of external debt statistics
by adopting Special Data Dissemination Standard

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the coverage and quality of external debt
statistics by adopting guidelines on Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The compilation of existing country specific table of external debt stock available at SBP
website has accordingly been revisited and aligned with the International Investment Position (IIP)
statement and international guidelines.

It may be mentioned here that these debt instruments are already being reported through
quarterly International Investment Position (IIP) of Pakistan statement available at SBP website of
which external debt is a sub-set. The impact of enhanced coverage of external financial liabilities has
resulted in rise of external debt by US$ 5,470 million for March 31, 2012, which is almost all in non
official sectors.

It may also be pointed out here that the guidelines available in IMF’s External Debt Guide
for Compilers and Users 2003 and SDDS Guide 2007 require to classify Inter-company Debt,
Private Sector Trade Credits, Non-resident Deposits with Depository Corporations, overdrawn
balances of non financial corporations and other debt liabilities as country’s external debt position.

In order to bring these developments to the notice of internal and external stakeholders, a
revision study has been prepared and made available on economic data page of SBP website.

State Bank keeps policy rate unchanged at 12 percent

The Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at
12 percent. This was announced by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar while unveiling the
Monetary Policy Statement at a press conference held at SBP, Karachi this afternoon.

Following is the text of SBP Governor’s press statement on Monetary Policy:-

‘The basic challenge faced by Pakistan’s economy is financing its fiscal and external current account deficits. The size
of these deficits may not be considered large given the current state of falling private sector investment demand in
the economy. A reflection of overall low aggregate demand can be seen in the declining inflation trend, contraction
in the real private sector credit, and falling volume of imports. The SBP’s monetary policy stance in FY12 so far, a
cumulative reduction of 200 basis points, has been largely framed in this context.

The lack of diversified and sustainable financing sources has resulted in substantial borrowings from the banking
system by the government and declining foreign exchange reserves. This has squeezed the availability of credit for
the private sector and increased the pressure on rupee liquidity. The SBP has been providing substantial liquidity on
almost permanent basis, on average Rs230 billion during 1st July — 9th February 2012, to ensure smooth functioning
of the payment system and avoid financial instability. The continuation of this trend, however, carries risks for
effectively anchoring inflation expectations in the medium term.

The uncertain market liquidity flows have lead to excess volatility in short term interest rates and increased the
challenges of monetary management. The main reasons for this uncertainty include: a sharper deterioration in the
external current account deficit, a declining trend of foreign inflows, and a higher currency to deposit ratio.
However, other market interest rates, such as KIBOR and Weighted Average Lending Rate (WALR), have largely
followed the policy rate reductions.

A declining interest rate environment together with a relatively better growth in Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) is
expected to help the pickup in private sector credit. The LSM sector grew by 1.5 percent during July-November,
FY12, which is in contrast to an average contraction of 3.1 percent during the same period of last three years.
Moreover, credit to the private sector has expanded by Rs238 billion during 1st July — 3rd February, FY12. However,
to assess its likely path few points need to be kept in mind.

First, given the continuing energy shortages, unfavorable law and order conditions, and an uncertain political
environment, the desired boost in business confidence and thus private sector credit may not take place. Second,
profitability of the textile sector, a major user of private sector credit, was better in FY11 due to higher cotton prices.
This would facilitate repayments or keep the demand for fresh credit to a minimum in FY12. Third, the utilization of
installed industrial capacity is considerably low and continues to decline, which is inhibiting credit demand for fixed
investment. Fourth, all of the fresh credit disbursement in H1-FY12 was utilized to meet the working capital
requirements, which implies that a significant part of this credit will be retired in H2-FY12.

Thus, the full year expansion in credit to the private sector is expected to remain weak for yet another year in FY12
despite interest rate reductions. Its year-on-year growth is already negative in real terms and indicates depressed
private investment demand in the economy. In addition, given substantial government borrowings from the

Banks asked to submit compliance report of every

order of Banking Mohtasib/SBP Governor

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has advised all banks/ DFls to submit a compliance
report of every order of Banking Mohtasib of Pakistan (BMP) and the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan along with documentary evidence, within one week of its compliance to the Head,
Consumer Protection Department, SBP through their duly authorized officers at or above the
rank of Executive Vice President/Group Head.

It may be pointed out that in terms of Section 82 E (5) of the Banking Companies
Ordinance 1962 (BCO), banks are required to comply with the decision of Banking Mohtasib of
Pakistan (BMP) within forty days of the date of Order. However, if an Appeal against the
decision of the Banking Mohtasib is referred to the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, the
aforesaid period of forty days reckons from the date of decision of Appeal.

Instances have been noted where banks have not adhered to the aforementioned
provisions of BCO and have complied with the Orders of BMP and the Governor, State Bank of
Pakistan with a significant delay, says CPD Circular No. 1 of February 28, 2012.

The State Bank has taken serious notice of such non-compliance and it has been decided
that such a violation of Section 82 E (5) of BCO 1962, shall be subject to penal action, it added.

This relaxation is only for the purpose of allowing extended period (i.e. till August 31,
2012) for matching performance requirement and in no way be construed as an extension in
export proceeds realization period as laid down under the foreign exchange rules and
regulations.

Accordingly, they (such exporters) may include entries showing realization of export
proceeds during July and August, 2012 in their EF-1 statement for the year 2011-12. However,
exporters having met the performance requirements of the Scheme shall submit EF-1
statement for the purpose of verification to Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD)

economy, considering it is a living and ever evolving organism,” he added.

Mr. Anwar said that a comprehensive understanding of the economy is necessary in order to
correctly calibrate monetary policy, which may then achieve the objectives of price stability and
economic growth. Mr. Anwar said that sharing ideas and experiences at a regional forum will help
central bankers better understand the nature of their economies. He urged them to explore the ways by
which monetary policy frameworks may be improved through mutual and collaborative efforts.

SBP Governor said the targets set by central banks have an effect on the real economy and
implications for price stability. However, central banks’ policies are more effective when they are
independent of fiscal influence, have market freedom and are time-consistent, he said, adding that the
absence of these conditions may reduce the efficacy of their (central banks’) policies. ‘The complexities
of today’s world have created challenges for monetary policy and we must occasionally toss conventional
prescriptions aside and seek customized solutions,’ he added.

Sharing his understanding on working of different channels of monetary policy, Mr. Anwar
disclosed that the real interest rate channel in Pakistan is found to be extremely weak during the times of
frequent price changes and high inflation. Quoting a recent study of SBP’s Research Department, he said
that prices are revised roughly every quarter in the economy. ‘Coupled with the fact that Pakistan’s
economy has experienced double-digit inflation during the last 4 years, prices are very quick to adjust to
changes in monetary policy,’ he said adding that a large part of inflation persistence in the country is due
to sustained period of high inflation, which has allowed inflationary expectations to incubate.

Mr. Anwar pointed out that the lending channel appears to be quite robust and is the key channel
through which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy in Pakistan. Similarly, the role of
exchange rate channel has also gained importance over time due to liberalization of the foreign exchange
market in the country. SBP monitors the forex market very closely while considering the impact of
changes in the exchange rate, he added. He observed that monetary policy may also influence inflation
through expectations channel.

SBP Governor said the transition from understanding these channels to developing the proper
mechanisms to impact our objectives may not be smooth. ‘After all, we should concede that there are
some things that we have absolutely no control over in the short-run,’ he said, adding that policy making
has become a difficult task in recent times.

SBP revises Guidelines on Stress Testing to further

strengthen risk management capacity of banks /DFls

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today issued the revised Guidelines on Stress
Testing in order to further strengthen the risk management capacity of banks and
Development Finance Institutions (DFls).

The revised guidelines, which are in conformity with international standards and
improved capacity of banks/ DFls to perform such analysis, have been divided into three
sections.

Section 1 of the revised guidelines prescribes standards for designing and
implementing the stress-testing framework, Section 2 delineates the mandatory set of
stress tests for credit, market and liquidity risk factors using sensitivity analysis, and
Section 3 provides guidance on optional stress tests for operational risk, Islamic banking,
and advanced approaches, including scenario analysis, and reverse stress tests.

All banks and DFls have been advised to submit the results of the stress tests as
specified in Section 2 on the prescribed format (Annexure —C) of these Guidelines to the
Banking Surveillance Department of the State Bank on quarterly basis, starting from
quarter ending June 30, 2012, within 30 days of the close of each quarter, says BSD
Circular No. 1 dated May 11, 2012.

The complete revised guidelines are on SBP website : www.sbp.org.pk

SBP extends the scope of Credit Guarantee Scheme

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has extended the scope of the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) by
including Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) as eligible Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) in order to enable
micro enterprises to benefit from this Scheme.

Now MFBs would be able to extend loans from above Rs. 150,000 up-to Rs. 500,000 to micro
enterprises for a tenor not exceeding 5 years, says IH&SMEFD Circular Letter No. 14 of December 04, 2012.

The Micro Finance Banks which have already obtained prior approval of SBP for undertaking
‘microenterprise’ lending as per AC&MFD Circular No.02 dated March 16, 2012, can apply for allocation of
Credit Exposure Limits under the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Circular Letter added.

It may be pointed out that earlier the CGS facility was open to Commercial Banks only. The Micro
Finance Banks would find great comfort in taking credit risks as they now enjoy the risk coverage of 40% on

their loans to micro enterprises.

Microfinance-exclusive Credit Information Bureau to reduce
risk of multiple borrowing & loan defaults: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that Microfinance-exclusive
Credit Information Bureau will help Microfinance Banks (MFBs) and Microfinance Institutions (MFls) in
developing robust risk management system and practices, which in turn reduce the risk of multiple
borrowing and loan defaults.

Delivering his key-note address at the national roll-out of Microfinance-exclusive Credit
Information Bureau (MF-CIB) at SBP Learning Resource Centre (LRC) Auditorium in Karachi today, he said
the MF-CIB will open access to credit for millions of potential poor borrowers and reduce the credit risk
cost of the lenders, besides lowering the loan price for the borrowers.

Mr. Anwar pointed out that at present even the credit-worthy borrowers of microfinance
institutions face difficulty in accessing larger loans from MFBs or commercial banks due to non-
availability of their long history of loans and timely repayments with a microfinance institution. ‘The MF-
CIB will facilitate in the ‘graduation’ of such livelihood-based workers into small entrepreneurs,’ he
added.

He said that this nation-wide MF-CIB will be a major step for both lenders and borrowers with
positive impact. ‘As the CIB expands its operations across the country, the quality and efficiency of the
loan appraisal process will improve significantly, he added.

SBP believes that a policy framework for credit bureaus is essential for their smooth and long-
term growth, he said, adding that the Government and SBP have already been working on the
development of a legal framework, which will strengthen private CIBs by establishing criteria for
licensing, issuing regulations, and creating oversight mechanism. ‘All this will result into stakeholders’
satisfaction, and, most importantly, it will boost public confidence,’ he added.

He said that SBP has played a sterling role in the development of microfinance sector as an
alternative to conventional banking to serve the lower end of the market. ‘However, there is a global
shift from microfinance to inclusive finance, that is, from supporting microfinance initiatives in isolation
to building inclusive financial sector,’ he added.

Financial inclusion, which is a core component of SBP’s financial sector development strategy,
will also stimulate economic growth for the country, he said, adding that it envisages transforming the
financial market into an equitable system with efficient market-based financial services to the otherwise
excluded poor and marginalized population including women and young people.

Mr. Anwar urged upon the CEOs/Presidents of MFBs and MFls to improve corporate
governance, management structures and put in place adequate systems & policies in their respective
organizations for ensuring protection of consumer rights. SBP is already in the process of revising
regulations to ensure that MFBs follow best standards in these critical areas, he said and added: ‘We
count on your wisdom and commitment to reach out to millions of financially excluded people.’

SBP issues minimum standards for sale

of third party products by banks/ DFls

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued minimum standards for the sale of third
party products by banks/ development finance institutions (DFls) to safeguard the interest of
the depositors/general public and prevent banks from incurring operational and reputational
risks.

‘Banks offering third party products must establish a centralized control function
entrusted with the responsibility to verify the information given in a sales proposal/application
forwarded by the sales staff. It is up to the banks how to structure the requisite control
function, however the underlying principle is that the person verifying the information should
not have any incentive linked with the sales volume,’ SBP said in its CPD Circular No. 2 of 29
June, 2012 issued to the Presidents/Chief Executives of all scheduled banks/DFls.

In addition to the existing set of documents, banks shall introduce a basic fact sheet
elaborating at least the following facts:
i. Two liner definition of the product.
ii. Disclaimer of the bank stating that it is only working in the capacity of a
distributor.
iii. | Return mechanism in terms of investment and premium schedule in terms of
bancassurance.
iv. Free look period in case of bancassurance.
v. Premature encashment procedure and its repercussions.
vi. | Redressal Mechanism in case of any grievance.
vii. Checklist of all the other documents signed or attached.

The basic fact sheet should be a distinct looking document including an undertaking by
the customer that he/she understands all the stated terms and conditions of the product. This
document, along with all the other documents, shall be printed in both Urdu & English with a
font size not smaller than 10.

Banks must institute a call back confirmation mechanism equipped with the Integrated
Voice Response system whereby every customer is contacted, briefed about the salient
features of the product and his/her confirmation is obtained before approving a sales proposal,
the Circular said.

To ensure that the bank has proper evidence of the fact that the investor was duly
briefed about the product and related terms/conditions, the record of every call made should
be retained for at least three years or until maturity of the product whichever is earlier.

SBP cuts policy rate by 50 bps to 10%

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has cut its policy rate by 50 basis points to 10 percent from 10.5
percent with effect from 8"" October 2012. The decision to cut the policy rate was taken by the Central Board
of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan at its meeting held under the chairmanship of SBP Governor, Mr.
Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today.

To strengthen the liquidity management framework, SBP has also decided to implement certain
measures, details of which are being issued separately.

‘A consistent deceleration in inflation since May 2012, to 8.8 percent in September 2012, is more
than earlier estimates. Thus, despite an expected uptick in H2-FY13, the overall inflation outlook has
improved. In fact, the likelihood of meeting the 9.5 percent inflation target for FY13 has increased,’ the
Monetary Policy said, adding that at the macro level, it seems that the effect on inflation of falling private
investment demand is becoming more pronounced than the influence of high fiscal borrowings.

‘The disaggregate CPI inflation data also show that this could be a beginning of a broad based trend.
The number of commodities with double digit year-on-year inflation has slightly come down in the last few
months after a secular increase over the last three years; first in the food group and now in the non food
group as well.’

The decline in 20 percent trimmed core inflation measure, to 10.4 percent in September 2012, is
slower than the fall in CPI inflation. ‘This indicates persistence of inflation expectations due to inertial effect
of high inflation experienced in the recent past, overall rising trend in fiscal borrowings from the SBP, and
depreciation of exchange rate,’ it said, adding that the recent fall in inflation together with a retirement of
Rs412 billion of fiscal borrowings from SBP during Q1-FY13 could bring down core inflation further by having
a beneficial impact on inflation expectations. This would depend, however, on the fiscal authority’s resolve to
maintain this trend in the coming quarters, the Monetary Policy observed.

While discussing the previous rate cut announced in August 2012, the Monetary Policy said that a
declining inflation together with weak growth in credit to private businesses was the basic context in which
SBP reduced its policy rate by 150 bps in August 2012.

‘The resumption of monetary easing, in this environment, was deemed necessary to influence the
behavior of borrowers in the private sector and scheduled banks to step up efforts to improve their
intermediary role,’ the Monetary Policy said and added that a host of factors needs to be considered for this
to be sufficiently effective.

‘Prominent among these are considerable improvement in the availability of energy and reduction in
fiscal borrowing needs from the banking system. The former is expected to facilitate an increase in the
demand for credit and the latter would help in improving the supply of credit to the private sector. Further
support to SBP’s initiative can come from realization of expected foreign financial inflows that would alleviate
the balance of payment concerns and help in easing the considerable fiscal pressure on domestic
borrowings,’ it added.

‘The effectiveness of SBP’s current monetary policy stance continues to weigh upon improvement in
the fiscal position, better availability of energy, and an increase in foreign financial inflows,’ it added.

The Monetary Policy pointed out that weak foreign financial inflows are the main challenge faced by
the balance of payment position. ‘The external current account balance, on the other hand, is small and
shrinking. In fact, during the first two months of FY13, it posted a surplus of $884 million. This is primarily due

for the vast majority of the business establishments in Pakistan (over 98%) and account
for over 78% percent of the non-agricultural employment in the country,’ he observed.

SBP on its part stands ready to support banks wishing to increase lending to this
important sector with appropriate policy interventions, he said and added that the State
Bank has revamped its Credit Guarantee Scheme and various refinancing schemes with
some encouraging results. He, however, noted with concern that the overall utilization
of these schemes is still below the expected levels, which, he said, needs to be looked
into seriously by participating banks. ‘The review of SME Prudential Regulations has
been completed after collecting feedback from relevant stakeholders and the revised
PRs will be issued soon,’ he added.

Expressing his dis-satisfaction over the decline of SME financing by banks, he said
that it was Rs 437 billion in Dec-2007, which dropped to Rs 268 billion in Sep-2011. ‘In
percentage terms, the share of SMEs financing in the total lending portfolio of banks has
also fallen from 16.2% in Dec-2007 to 7.7% by Sep-2011. Clearly, this is not a very
desirable situation,’ he observed.

SBP Governor said that a broad analysis of banks’ aggregate SME loan portfolio
shows that a major share of total SME Advances (i.e. 76%) constitutes Working Capital
loans, which suggests reluctance on the part of banks to meet the long-term financing

SBP prescribes Standard Application Format for
Refund of Fine under the Export Finance Scheme

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has prescribed a Standard Application Format for
Refund of Fine under the Export Finance Scheme.

With a view to bring more clarity and simplify the procedure of submission of refund of
fine cases under SMEFD Circular No.5 of December 26, 2008; a Standard Application Format
for Refund of Fine has been prescribed. This will not only save time required for examining
refund cases but also reduce load of documents being submitted by banks to State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP). Therefore, banks have been advised by SBP to submit their customers’ request
for refund of fine/extension in performance period due to failure to meet required export
performance under the Export Finance Scheme on account of reasons beyond control on
application form attached with this circular letter (IH&SMEFD circular letter No.5 of June 6,
2012).

Further, the information required as per Annexure-R attached to SMEFD Circular No.5 of
December 2008 has been revised. The exporter(s) should submit all the documents as
prescribed in the SMFED Circular No.5 dated December 26, 2008 to their bank while applying
for waiver of fine/extension in shipment/performance period, whereas the bank will submit
only those documents to SBP as specified in the Application for Refund of Fine. However, the
banks are required to keep all relevant documents for record.

The SBP has advised the Presidents/CEOs/Country Managers of all banks to circulate the
Standard Application Format for refund and revised Annexure ‘R’ immediately to their branches

and also provide a copy of the same to their exporters.

SBP DEPUTY GOVERNOR ASSURES FINANCIAL INCLUSION WILL
REMAIN A KEY POLICY OBJECTIVE OF THE STATE BANK

 

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Deputy Governor Banking, State Bank of Pakistan
has outlined five key aspects of the Microfinance Summit 2013, in his closing and way
forward remarks while chairing the Closing Session of the Microfinance Summit at a
local hotel in Islamabad today.

He said that the summit was a huge success in bringing together all the
stakeholders who shared their unique experiences and developed recommendations to
enhance access to inclusive financial services for the financially excluded economic and
geographic segments.

Mr.Wathra said that financial inclusion movement has prompted innovative
developments in Pakistan and elsewhere. However, it is often that ‘innovations’ are
viewed differently by various stakeholders. It is, therefore, important to keep on
analyzing and discussing new ideas and solutions to agree on the way forward and chart
the avenues for further collaborations to reach out to the marginalized, poor and low-
income people.

He said that the summit has developed broader understanding of the opportunities and
challenges facing the microfinance sector in Pakistan:

e First, Government offered full support to the development of microfinance
sector on sustainable basis and the participants have appreciated the vision of
the new Government. | am sure that this will help us in taking the
microfinance to the next level.

e Second, microfinance sector has received a lot of support from the
government, State Bank, and donors in the form of an enabling policy and
regulatory framework and funding support resulting in transformation of MFls
into regulated microfinance banks, a well-capitalized and diversified micro-
banking sector and catalyzing innovations in delivery channels etc., We have a
long way to go especially in increasing sustainable financial access and usage
of a broad range of services (savings, credit, payments, and insurance) to the
most-excluded segments such as poor entrepreneurs in under-developed
areas, women and youth. In this context, it is important to adopt a market
segmentation approach which would help us in analyzing the gaps at different
segments, and develop timely and appropriate policy responses and solutions.

Pakistan’s economy has the ability to navigate
through choppy waters: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Yaseen Anwar today said that Pakistan’s economy has
the ability to navigate through choppy waters. ‘I’m excited by the economic potential that this country
holds, and | encourage you all to become a part of the country’s future by becoming a part of the
solution,’ he said while delivering a speech at Pakistan Navy War College, Lahore.

He said that while our current economic situation is less than optimal, it is also very far from what may
be described as an economic calamity. Mr. Anwar said that in 65 years, Pakistan has never gone through
an episode of hyperinflation; Pakistan has never defaulted on its international and domestic debts; in
fact, our economy has grown consistently, but not spectacularly, over the past six decades. ‘This has
been despite periods of international alienation and sanctions, three expensive wars, two hostile fronts,
regular political upheaval, social unrest, sharp increases in the price of oil, and much, much more,’ he
added.

Mr. Anwar said the State Bank has always ensured that the financial system of the country remains safe
and stable. The robustness of our financial system is a direct consequence of the reforms process and
the State Bank’s constant vigilance, he said, adding that there’s a lot that can be improved in our
financial system. He called for the development of efficient debt markets, even better regulatory and
reporting practices, and the broadening of the financial sector’s scope to include largely unbanked
sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, small and medium enterprises, and housing. ‘Despite this
wish-list, the fact remains that our financial system is, by design, secure and does not pose any threat to
the economy as a whole,’ he added.

SBP Governor pointed out that the size of Pakistan’s undocumented economy is, by some estimates, as
large as the formal economy. The informal economy does not file taxes and, while it does absorb a
significant chunk of the labour force, it also evades corporate and labour laws, he said, adding that
although close informal relationships do make the economy more resilient, they do so at a cost to the
overall economy, by eroding the ambit of the regulators. ‘Ideally, we, at the State Bank, would like to
see a smaller informal economy, while society retains the structure that has made it so resilient,’ he
observed.

He stressed the need for the greater integration of country’s domestic market with global markets but
observed it does not mean that we should not have proper controls and mechanisms in place to
safeguard our own interests. ‘Greater integration with financial markets will mean that capital will flow
more quickly through our borders. It’s definitely something that will boost the national economy, but, as
most East Asian countries learned in the 90s, it can be a double-edged sword. Therefore, having some
capital controls in place, which reduce the volatility of capital flows, is a necessary regulation in this day
and age,’ Mr. Anwar added.

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan hosted the 26"" SAARCFINANCE, Group Meeting, 9°""
Governors’ Symposium, and 42"" Asian Clearing Union, Board of Directors Meeting, at a local hotel in
Islamabad. Dr Fazeel Najeeb, Governor and Chairman, Maldives Monetary Authority chaired the

Governor State Bank. Pakistan also assumed chair of the ACU, hence Governor SBP, Yaseen Anwar
chaired the 42""¢ ACU Board of Directors meeting as well.

Some key decisions were taken in the SAARCFINANCE Group Meeting, including:

1. SAARCFINANCE 10-year history folder portal was launched. The portal is a systematic collection
and compilation of information on SAARCFINANCE activities. The portal will also post details of
important policy decisions made on SAARCFINANCE fora, and will create institutional memory.

2. To start off the SAARC scholarship scheme, Reserve Bank of India has offered one scholarship
per year to an applicant from SAARC region.

The focus of the Governors’ symposium was to gauge the impact of the Euro Debt Crisis on the SAARC
region. To complement the country specific presentations, two key-note speakers, Dr Ishrat Husain (Ex-
Governor SBP) and Dr Ehtisham Ahmad (Ex-IMF, now fellow with the University of Bonn), set the
framework for the country specific presentations.

In his introductory comments, Governor Yaseen Anwar gave a comprehensive, yet concise timeline of
the series of events that have created the challenging economic conditions in Europe. He highlighted
how the loss of risk appetite after the US mortgage crisis in 2007/08, triggered the stresses that heavily
indebted peripheral European countries currently face. Although, Governor Yaseen Anwar
acknowledged some adverse impact on Pakistan via European export demand and foreign investment,
he concluded that Pakistan has largely been insulated from the fallout of the Euro Crisis.

Dr Ishrat Husain, echoed Governor Yaseen’s assessment, but extended the view to capture the entire
SAARC region. Criticizing the assumption that a common currency would bring ‘endogenous
convergence’, Dr Ishrat said that instead of addressing their fiscal divergence, easy Euro financing
allowed countries to ignore their fiscal problems and live beyond their means. He concluded with the
view that the problems in South Asia are similar and domestic in nature.

Dr Ehtisham Ahmad built on Dr Ishrat’s talk, by highlighting the role of standardized information to
gauge whether EU member countries were in fact complying with the spirit of the convergence criteria
that created the Euro.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has now decided to publish an additional report: “Bank-Wise Access to
Overnight Repo/Reverse Repo Facilities on Quarterly Basis” on its website. The report will provide
market with details of number of times individual institutions have accessed SBP Interest rate corridor

Banks have already been given flexibility (vide DMMD Circular No. 21 of October 05, 2012) with
enhancement of reserves maintenance period to two weeks and reduction in daily minimum Cash Reserve
Requirement (CRR) to 3.0%. Hence, SBP believes that broadcasting of this data will promote
transparency and encourage banks/DFIs to improve their liquidity management practices and ensure

smooth functioning of Interest Rate Corridor.

The web link to access this data is: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/Bank-IRC-Activity.pdf

 

It may be pointed out that the Domestic Markets & Monetary Management Department (DMMD) of SBP
currently publishes consolidated and Bank-wise weekly reports on Excess Cash Reserves held by the
banks over and above the required CRR on SBP website. The objective of publishing these reports was to
bring more efficiency in the money market operations of the banks and to improve banks/DFIs’ own
liquidity management, which have implications on SBP’s monetary operations. In addition to these
reports, DMMD also disseminates data of consolidated access to SBP Repo/Reverse Repo facilities by the

Pakistan’s economy grows by 3.7%
in FY12: SBP Annual Report

Pakistan’s economy witnessed a modest improvement in FY12 — real GDP grew by 3.7 percent during
the year, compared with 3.0 percent in FY11, says the State Bank’s Annual Report on the State of the
Economy for the year 2011-12 released today. It said the growth was more broad-based compared to
FY11, as it was evenly distributed across agriculture, industry and the services sector.

The demand side was more insightful, as the growth in FY12 was primarily driven by private
consumption, it said, adding that strong worker remittances, a vibrant informal economy and higher
fiscal spending, supported consumption growth during the year.

SBP Report said that food prices have remained relatively stable during FY12, which helped bring
down overall inflation to 11.1 percent — better than the 12.0 percent projected earlier. ‘It was this
easing that allowed the central bank to reduce the policy rate by 200 bps during the year; this was
done to partially revive private sector borrowing, and encourage banks to improve their
intermediation between private savers and borrowers,’ the Report added.

According to the Report, the external front was positive as remittances posted yet another year of
strong growth, which not only helped narrow the current account deficit, but also contributed to
economic activity. ‘In overall terms, the external sector has been less worrying than anticipated at the
beginning of the year; however, as financial inflows dried up, the burden of financing the current
account deficit and external debt, has fallen on the country’s FX reserves,’ the Report added.

While services continued to support the economy, commodity producing sectors (agriculture and
industry) posted an improvement over FY11, the Report said, adding that the growth in agriculture
came from livestock and kharif crops, but minor crops witnessed a decline due to the floods in Q1-
BY 12.

It said the positive spillovers from agriculture, coupled with strong remittances and income support
schemes, boosted construction activities and household consumption — both of which helped the
manufacturing sector. ‘In terms of services, there was a sharp improvement in financial sector
earnings, driven primarily by the volume of commercial bank financing of the fiscal deficit, and
deceleration in fresh non-performing loans (NPLs),’ the Report added.

Among other factors, SBP’s decision to cut its policy rate by a cumulative 200 bps in H1-FY12 was
partially motivated by its concern over commercial banks’ reluctance to extend credit to the private
sector. However, in the presence of a risk-free dominant borrower, average bank lending rates fell by
only 112 bps, which suggest that banks remain apprehensive about (or uninterested in lending to) the
private sector, and were willing to accept lower earnings on government securities, according to the
Report.

It said the actual outcome in the external sector in FY12 was better: a current account deficit of US$
4.6 billion, and an overall gap of US$ 3.3 billion, meant that Pakistan’s FX reserves fell by US$ 4.0
billion, against an initial projection of US$ 4.4 billion. ‘Nevertheless, this contributed to a 9.1 percent
depreciation of the Rupee during the course of the year. The Rupee depreciated from November to
late December 2011, and sharply so in the last week of May 2012. The first event may have been

STATE BANK INVITES SUGGESTIONS/VIEWS ON CONCEPT PAPER AND
REGULATIONS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENT GATEWAYS

The State Bank of Pakistan has placed initial draft of a concept paper and
regulations for establishment of electronic payment gateways in Pakistan on its website
for public comments and feedback. It may be mentioned here that a payment gateway
is an e-commerce application service provider to authorise payments of e-businesses by
acting as an intermediary between an acquiring institution and the issuing institution.
An e-payment gateway will facilitate authorisation of local and cross border transactions
in such a way that local transactions will be routed, processed and authorised
domestically and only cross border transactions will be routed via international payment
schemes operating in Pakistan such as VISA, MasterCard, etc. for authorization.

These documents besides the concept of e-payment gateway discuss the regulatory
requisites and other relevant pre-conditions for entities to become eligible for applying
as e-PG operator mandated to safely route, process, and authorise local and cross
border financial transactions performed by customers using various Alternative Delivery
Channels (ADCs).

The drafts of the concept paper and regulations on Electronic Payment Gateway
have been posted at SBP website www.sbp.org.pk for feedback/ comments from the

YASEEN ANWAR STRESSES UPON ISLAMIC FINANCE INDUSTRY
TO DEVELOP ISLAMIC MICROFINANCE

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed upon the Islamic
finance industry to make individual as well as collaborative efforts to develop Islamic
microfinance in the country.

Addressing opening session of the Islamic Finance News Pakistan Road show on Islamic
Banking held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today, Mr. Anwar said Islamic Microfinance,
a confluence of two industries; Islamic Finance and Microfinance, can not only be an efficient
tool for financial inclusion by catering to both voluntary and involuntary financially excluded
but also towards poverty reduction due to its inherent characteristic of being prudent and asset
based.

He said that financial inclusion is one of the key strategic objectives of SBP and
emphasized the industry to develop capacity to tap strategically important sectors of
agriculture and SMEs and create value for shareholders, depositors, and the country’s economy
as a whole. He assured SBP will provide every support and facilitation to the industry in efforts
to build and expand its portfolio in these sectors.

Mr. Anwar said Islamic banking in Pakistan has witnessed significant growth during the
last decade and now constitutes over 10 percent of the country’s banking system with an asset
base of over Rs.900 billion and a network of more than 1,100 branches. ‘This expansionary
trend is likely to continue and the industry is well set to double its market share by 2020’, he
added.

The Governor said the Islamic financial institutions are currently offering a wide range of
services catering to both Muslim and non-Muslim communities. The unprecedented growth of
the Islamic finance industry can be associated to efforts of dedicated regulatory, Shariah, and
academic institutions along with the presence of diversified players in the field, i.e., Islamic
banks, investment banks, takaful companies, Islamic fund management companies, and Islamic
brokerage companies.

Mr. Anwar said Pakistan has remained at the fore front in promoting Islamic finance by
being a key member of International Islamic finance institutions established to develop
necessary legal, regulatory, supervisory, and Shariah compliant infrastructure for Islamic
finance institutions. He said that Pakistan’s active engagement with the Islamic Financial
Services Board (IFSB), the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial
Institutions (AAOIFI) and the International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM) and collaboration
with other central banks has helped the growth of the Islamic banking industry both locally and
at the global level.

Mr. Yaseen Anwar stresses the need for inculcating risk culture
for sound management of operational risks

 

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has stressed the need for inculcating
a risk culture within the organization with open communication channels between business
lines and control functions for the sound management of operational risks.

While delivering his opening remarks at the ‘Conference on Operational Risk Management’ at
SBP Learning Resource Centre in Karachi today, he said that SBP is cognizant of its
responsibilities regarding sound operational risk management frameworks in banks. ‘SBP will
continue to play its role in ensuring effectiveness of the established frameworks in banks. We
expect each bank to develop and continuously improve its risk management and control
framework depending on nature, location, size, sophistication, complexity of business
operations and approved risk appetite,’ Mr. Anwar added.

Stressing the need for close cooperation between banks and SBP, Mr. Anwar said that the
exchange of ideas is very important in capacity building for operational risk management. He
expressed the hope that this conference would provide a good opportunity to exchange our
thoughts on risk management and learn from each other’s experiences.

SBP Governor, in his address, dwelt at length on three main areas of risks including Operational
risk management — the issues and challenges; Basel Accord treatment of operational risk and
emergence of sound principles on risk management and Regulatory developments &
supervisory expectations to strengthen the operational risk management within the banking
sector.

Highlighting the importance of risk management, Mr. Anwar said that the SBP will expand its
existing reporting mechanism in order to have comprehensive and current information on
operational risk of banks.

Mr. Anwar said that SBP has adopted a two pronged strategy for effectively addressing the
issues of operational risks: i) to update the existing instructions on frauds & forgeries and
monitoring in banks, ii) issuance of guidelines on operational risk data collection to enhance the
scope of loss data gathering in line with the Basel Accord requirements and to provide the
industry with minimum set of instructions for consistent recognition of losses and their
reporting to a centralized data consortium. ‘These projects are at an advanced stage of

and other countries during the first nine months of current fiscal year (July- March FY13)
amounted to $752.04 million as against $710.47 million received in the first nine months of last
fiscal year (July- March FY12).

The monthly average remittances for July-March FY13 period comes out to $1,150.44
million as compared to $1,081.77 million during the corresponding period of the last fiscal year.

In March 2013, the inflow of remittances from Saudi Arabia, UAE, USA, UK, GCC
countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman), and EU countries amounted to $351.53
million, $220.22 million, $175.53 million, $150.22 million, $128.36 million and $26.43 million
respectively as compared with the inflow of $329.45 million, $ 237.04 million, $198.90 million,
$140.65 million, $130.58 million and $28.54 million respectively in March, 2012. Remittances
received from Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan and other countries during the
ninth month of the current fiscal year (March FY13) amounted to $66.86 million.

The continued growth in workers’ remittances is the result of the efforts made by
Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) in collaboration with other stakeholders to facilitate both
Overseas Pakistanis and their families back home. Since its inception, PRI has taken a number of
steps to enhance the flow of remittances through formal channels which include: (a)
preparation of national strategies on remittances (b) taking all necessary steps to implement
the overall strategy (c) playing the advisory role for financial sector in terms of preparing a
business case, relationship building with overseas correspondents, creating separate efficient
remittance payment highways and (d) becoming a national focal point for overseas Pakistanis
through round the clock call centre (021-111-222-774) with toll free lines, separate web site

State Bank raises policy rate by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent

The State Bank of Pakistan has raised the policy rate by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent with effect
from 16"" September, 2013. This was announced by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr.
Yaseen Anwar while unveiling the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) for the next two months at
a press conference at SBP Learning Resource Centre, Karachi. The decision to raise the policy
rate was taken at a meeting of the Central Board of Directors of SBP held under his
chairmanship in Karachi today.

Mr. Anwar said that the fundamental issues for sluggish long-term economic growth in Pakistan
such as weak economic management and low productivity had largely remained unaddressed. He
added that the “economy has experienced bouts of growth and stable inflation but a sustainable
performance has remained largely elusive.”

According to Governor SBP, a relentless increase in fiscal borrowings and a secular decline in
both domestic and foreign investments are only symptoms of structural issues. “The role of
monetary policy was always going to be limited in this environment; both in terms of keeping
inflation low and stable and supporting private investment activity. However, in the wake of
considerable deceleration in inflation over the last two years, the SBP did lower its policy rate by
500 basis points.”

Mr. Anwar said that the SBP also intervened in financial markets by imposing a minimum
savings deposit rate at 6 percent and containing volatility in the foreign exchange market. It also
calibrated its liquidity operations in a manner that balanced financial stability considerations and
medium-term inflation risks. He added that as a result of these actions, “the weighted average
lending rate has declined by 423 basis points by end-July 2013 while deposits of the banking
system grew by 15.9 percent and the depreciation of exchange rate was limited to 5.1 percent in
FY13.”

Governor SBP said that a declining interest rate environment did contribute in a marginal pick up
in loans to some sectors of private businesses in FY 13 but “most of the loans were used to fulfill
the working capital requirements only”. He added that the “real private investment expenditures
have declined for the fifth consecutive year, reaching 8.7 as percent of GDP in FY13.”

He said that higher interest rates were not the major constraining reason for the private sector
credit off-take adding that two “fundamental factors responsible for the lackluster increase in
credit demand are: persistence of energy shortages and deterioration in law and order
conditions.”

Finance Minister visits State Bank of Pakistan

The Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar and the Governor SBP held a meeting Friday July 26, 2013 with
representatives of Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) at SBP Karachi. The productive
meeting was held in a very cordial and positive atmosphere. The Finance Minister at the outset
expressed his appreciation of the positive role played by exchange companies in the past for the country
and hoped that they would once again remain conscious of their responsibilities in stabilizing the
exchange rate in support of Pakistan’s economy.

He expressed concern over the rising spread between the Interbank and Kerb market rates recently and

emphasized his confidence that exchange companies would work towards narrowing the gap. The ECAP
members presented their views and proposals, following which it was decided that ECAP would have
another meeting with the Governor SBP to deliberate on the issues and arrive at substantive measures
for implementation with expectation that exchange companies would play their positive role in bringing

94.4% banks’ branches offer Real-Time Online
Banking services in Pakistan: SBP

Over ninety-four percent of banks’ branches in Pakistan are now offering Real-Time Online Branches
(RTOB) services as 50 more bank branches were added to the RTOB network during the third quarter of
the current fiscal year (FY13), says the State Bank of Pakistan’s Payment Systems Review for the third
quarter of FY13 released today.

Overall 9,946 branches of banks out of 10,535 now offer RTOB services across the country. The volume
of overall e-banking transactions in the country also increased by 3.47 percent amounting to 82.21
million transactions and value of e-banking transactions registered a growth of 4.37 percent reaching Rs.
7.9 trillion during the third quarter of the current fiscal year, the Review added.

The Payment Systems infrastructure in the country maintained an increasing growth trend

during the third quarter of FY13 and 217 more Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were installed by
various banks bringing the total number of ATMs in the country to 6,449.

The Review said that the number of plastic cards in the country also witnessed an increase of

Fresh laws needed to ensure information safety:
Deputy Governor SBP

Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, has said that innovative banking
practices have increased the need to introduce fresh laws and regulations to ensure client privacy,
information safety, and payment accessibility. He was speaking to the InfoSec2013 — 8"" International
Conference on Information Security. Mr. Wathra said that globally, more than two billion adults did not
have access to formal or semi-formal financial services. “They are the financially excluded in a world
where access to financial services can mean the difference between surviving or thriving. Innovative
modes of financial services delivery can have a transformative effect on poor households. At the same
time, one billion people with mobile phones do not have even a basic bank account.”

According to DG SBP, the time is ripe for using technology to address financial exclusion. “Technological
innovation changes the cost and access equation — making it economically viable for financial service
providers, often in partnership, to reach poor people, with a wider range of products and services.”

Mr. Wathra said that in Pakistan, the banking system despite its major transformation “remains
restricted in its outreach. In a population of 185 million, there are only 32 million deposit accounts and 6
million borrowers. On the contrary, the number of mobile phone subscribers has crossed 130 million
across all economic and geographic segments.”

“To tackle the challenge of financial exclusion, SBP is promoting the use of alternative delivery channels
that leverage technology and agents networks,” he added. He said that with this evolution, the need to
consistently strive for holistic risk mitigation “has become greater than ever before and financial
institutions around the globe realize that they must proactively work to protect customer data and
transactions, as well as their own Information system assets”.

According to Mr. Wathra mobile banking creates a heightened level of potential operations risks adding
that security is one of the biggest customer concerns when considering e-banking adoption.

He said that during the last few years, technology adoption (especially, in communication systems
cellular/mobile systems) had shown a great momentum and spread at an unbelievable pace across
developing countries. New channels such as Short Message Service (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary
Service Data (USSD), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and SIM Application Toolkit (SAT) are widely
being used to conduct financial transactions and transmit customers integrally important and
confidential details. “But standards for wireless communication are still evolving, creating considerable
uncertainty regarding the scalability of existing wireless products. Financial institutions today more than

SBP Deputy Governor calls for building inclusive
and stable financial sector in Pakistan

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Kazi Abdul Muktadir has advised the consumer
associations, trade bodies, Banking Ombudsman, financial & legal functionaries, banks and Competition
Commission to join hands in eradicating financial consumer malpractices for building an inclusive and
stable financial sector in Pakistan.

Delivering his key note address on ‘Financial Inclusion, Consumer Awareness and Protection’ at the 4""
Conference on Financial Services and Consumers at a local hotel in Karachi, he regrettably pointed out
that financial sector in Pakistan remains restricted in its outreach as the majority of population remains
either excluded or informally served. ‘This limited access is reflected in the total number of bank
accounts, presently around 32 million, and the total number of borrowers, which is only 5.7 million,’ he
added. This high level of financial exclusion is largely attributed to two major factors, i) lack of
appropriate product offering by financial service providers and ii) lack of public awareness about
availability of financial services and products, he said.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir said that SBP is cognizant of high financial exclusion in the country and committed
to tackling the associated challenges in a sustainable manner. He outlined the multi-pronged financial
inclusion strategy of SBP as under:

— Introduction of Basic Banking Account (BBA), requiring commercial banks operating in Pakistan
to provide basic banking facilities to the low income people of the country. A BBA can be opened
with a minimum deposit of Rs1, 000 carrying no fee, no limit of minimum balance and offering
full ATM facility.

— Introduction of the Annual Branch Licensing Policy which requires commercial banks with 100
branches or more to open at least 20% of their branches outside big cities and set up branches in
Tehsil Headquarters where no branch of any bank exists.

— A world class regulatory framework to enable commercial microfinance and branchless banking
in Pakistan.

— A national microfinance strategy

SBP with the assistance of UK Department for International Development (DFID) and other donors
launched programs to increase access to finance in the country, he said, adding that the DFID-funded
Financial Inclusion Program (FIP) aims to address financial exclusion through a variety of interventions.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir pointed out that FIP interventions largely focus on addressing market failures and
industry bottlenecks, while addressing issues of fair treatment of clients and consumer protection.

FIP is supporting the establishment of a separate national level Credit Information Bureau for
microfinance clients, he said, adding that FIP is also supporting Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN)
to introduce the Transparent Pricing Initiative in Pakistan. ‘This initiative will make the prices for the
microfinance market available for the first time in history,’ SBP Deputy Governor added.

SMEs can serve as growth engine of economy: Governor SBP

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said that close collaboration
among the key stakeholders would help in creating synergies for growth of SMEs. In his
keynote address to 7 Pakistan SME Conference on “Strengthening Institutional Ties for
Increasing SME’s Access to Finance” organized by M/s Shamrock Conferences at Lahore,
he said SMEs “have the potential to serve as a growth engine of the economy by providing
economic linkages/ services to the corporate sector, generating employment and alleviating
poverty.”

According to the Governor SBP, the SME sector contributes 30 percent towards Pakistan’s
GDP, employs more than 78 percent of the non-agricultural workforce, accounts for 35
percent of the value added in the manufacturing industry, and generates 25 percent in
export earnings.

“However, despite its strong potential, the SME sector is vulnerable to economic shocks
and hence is perceived as a highly risky sector by the banks,” Mr. Anwar said, adding that
the key reason for the low level of exposure in the SME sector is the banks’ reticence
towards this market segment.

Mr. Anwar mentioned high risk perception, high transaction costs of lending and increasing
NPLs, lack of proper accounting records and financial literacy as some of the problems
contributing to this reticence.

He further said that this state of affairs “demands a robust strategy for the development of
the SME sector.”

The Governor SBP said that the stakeholders appeared to be operating in their silos. He
stressed the need for forging close collaboration among the key stakeholders like SBP,
PBA, SMEDA, Business Support Fund (BSF), SME Associations and the Chambers of
Commerce & Industry.

He urged all institutions responsible for SME sector uplift to strengthen their ties and work
together for achieving the objective of SMEs enhanced access to formal credit.

On SBP’s role in the promotion of SME Financing he said that “financial inclusion is an
integral part of SBP’s financial sector development strategy, and SME Finance is one of the

key components of financial inclusion.”

Currency Swap Arrangement with China
becomes operational and Auction announced: SBP

A bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement (CSA) between the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and
the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) amounting to Chinese Yuan (CNY) 10 billion and PKR 140 billion is
being implemented from today after issuance of necessary instructions to banks and completion of
operational formalities with PBoC.

The landmark bilateral CSA was signed between SBP and PBoC by SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen
Anwar and PBoC Deputy Governor, Mr. DU Jinfu in December 2011 in Islamabad.

Implementation Guidelines from SBP: Currency Swap Agreement between the two Central
Banks will give a positive signal to the market on the availability of liquidity of other country’s currency
in the onshore market. The arrangement will augment the pool of liquidity available to finance bilateral
trade between the two countries, supplementing the already available sources of liquidity.

In order to ensure transparency in determination of market interest rates, the State Bank of
Pakistan has decided to conduct competitive auctions of Chinese Yuan (CNY) Loan Facility. As part of
the implementation guidelines, SBP has also announced an Auction of Chinese Yuan Loan Facility.
Based on the participation of banks in this auction, SBP will draw on the Swap Line and provide CNY to
banks in Pakistan. Banks will on-lend this liquidity to importers/ exporters involved in trade
denominated in CNY. At maturity, the importer/exporter will repay the foreign currency to the lending
bank, which in turn will repay to the respective central bank. Detailed guidelines can be accessed from
the following link to SBP website: http://www.sbp.org.pk/dmmd/2013/C9.htm

In order to provide sufficient lead time for banks to arrange on-lending of CNY to importers /
exporters, the first auction will be conducted on 04Jun2013 with settlement on 13Jun2013.

All banks are expected to educate their customers on the additional option of denominating
their Trade documents in CNY. SBP would encourage banks to hold sessions with local Trade bodies.
All importers/ exporters are also requested to contact their respective banks for more details on how
they can borrow Chinese Yuan (CNY) liquidity to finance bilateral trade.

Objectives & Structure of CSA: The objective of the Currency Swap Arrangement is to promote
bilateral trade and investment between the two countries in the respective local currencies. Since the
CSA is a bi-lateral financial transaction, all terms & conditions apply equally to both countries and the
pricing is based on standard market benchmarks which are widely acceptable in the respective
domestic markets. The execution of bilateral CSA was achieved through series of technical level team
discussions between both Central Banks lead by Mr. YAO Yudong from People’s Bank of China & Mr.

Asad Qureshi from State Bank of Pakistan.

Branchless banking accounts grow by 10 percent

Branchless banking accounts witnessed a growth of 10 percent during April-June 2013 quarter
and reached 2.6 million in number. According to the 8th issue of State Bank of Pakistan’s
Branchless Banking Newsletter for the second quarter of CY 2013, branchless banking providers
collectively performed 44.8 million transactions during the quarter valuing Rs. 173 billion,
showing 9 percent growth in numbers and 1 percent growth in value. On average, agents
performed 497,333 transactions per day with an average transaction size of Rs. 3,870. The
number of agents offering branchless banking services surpassed 93,800 as of end of the quarter.
However, the observed growth has also been enabled by the growing trend of shared agents.

As per analysis provided in the Newsletter, eighty-three percent of total transactions have been
done through over the counter (OTC), whereas only twelve percent transactions were performed
through m-wallets. Fund transfer transactions continued to form a major share in numbers and
value of OTC transactions, followed by utility bill payments. Both of these types of transactions
not only constituted a major share of BB transactions but also represented the prime categories
for industry wide growth and earnings.

According to the Newsletter, branchless banking industry in Pakistan is expected to become
competitive with the entry of new players. During the last two quarters, three new players i.e.
Mobicash, Timepey, and HBL Express have initiated BB operations whereas U-Microfinance
Bank commenced its branchless banking operations under the brand name U-Paisa in August
2013 as well. Further expansion in the market is also expected in the coming quarters, since a
few other banks, which are currently in the pilot phase, are preparing to launch their BB
operations.

Branchless Banking accounts grow by 20 percent

Branchless banking in the country continues to grow substantially and number of BB
accounts has reached 2.1 million during October — December, 2012 quarter, registering an
impressive growth of 20 percent.

According to SBP’s latest Branchless Banking Newsletter, this growth is mainly
attributed to 49% growth in level 0 accounts. Level 3 accounts also registered significant growth
of 37% during the quarter mainly due to entry of two new players, ‘Mobicash’ and ‘Timepey’
while a marginal growth of 2% was observed in both level 1 and 2 accounts.

Almost 35 million transactions worth Rs.151 billion have been processed during the
quarter. The average size of transaction was Rs 4,278, while the average number of transaction
per day increased to 392,433 from 354,367 during the previous quarter.

The fast growing network of BB agents reached 41,567 as of 31st December, 2012 from
30,540 as on 30th June, 2012 registering an increase of 36 %. This growth is attributable mainly
to the entry of new players. However, this number does not take into account “shared” agents
(i.e., an agent serving multiple providers).

Branchless banking deposits have grown by 35 percent to Rs 1 billion while person to
person fund transfers constituted significant share of 33% in value of total transactions.

According to the Newsletter, bill payments and top-ups (45%) ranked top, followed by
P2P fund transfers (34%). G2P welfare payments through BB channels have increased from
Rs. 4.1 billion to Rs. 5 billion, registering a growth of 27% during the quarter. Moreover, Rs. 2.7
million have also been disbursed to Employees’ Old-Age Benefit Institution’s pensioners through
agents.

Mobile Banking - a game changer in banking,
m-commerce & financial inclusion: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has said that developments in branchless
banking across the country have been so far marvelous, leaving nobody in doubt about the potential of
mobile phone banking to be a game-changer in banking, m-commerce and financial inclusion.

Speaking at the 6"" International Conference on “Mobile Banking in Pakistan” at a local hotel in Karachi
today, he said that developments in m-banking and m-commerce will lead us to connect the unbanked
segment of our population to financial services, thus contributing to their empowerment.

The central policy objectives of SBP are to ensure safety, soundness and efficiency of the banking
system, and to protect the interest of consumers, he said, adding that since branchless banking is
becoming a vital component of the national payment grid, it is prudent for all stakeholders to ensure
that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate inherent risks associated with it like access by un-
authorized persons/ criminals such as hackers, money launderers, terrorist financiers etc.

He said: ‘Being fully cognizant of the risk factors involved in such unconventional modes of banking, SBP
has been proactively monitoring developments and associated risks both at system and entity level in
order to take appropriate corrective measures in a timely manner’.

SBP Governor said that branchless banking has also proved to be an effective instrument in channelizing
the Government to Persons (G2P) payments in trying times like serving Internally Displaced Persons
(IDPs), and devastating floods for the last two years. The Benazir Income Support Program (BISP)
beneficiaries are also being served effectively through the same mechanism, he said, adding that In the
coming days, this channel is expected to continue playing an important role towards the promotion of
financial inclusion and the management of Government to Person (G2P) Programs like Salaries
Disbursements, Pensions, BISP, Watan Cards, Pakistan Cards and tax collections services, etc. The
existing branchless banking deployments can cater to the needs of over 10 million potential
beneficiaries of G2P payments in Pakistan, he added.

Mr. Anwar said that four branchless banking models including Easy Paisa, Omni, Mobile Cash and Time
Pey are fully operational while two are running live pilots. He said that the branchless banking current
growth trajectory is expected to get further steeper in the years ahead.

He said that the number of agent network servicing branchless banking customers has reached 42, 000.
Therefore, the basic financial services can now be accessed in the remotest parts of the country through
any of these agents. 194 million transactions worth Rs 813 billion and more than 2 million m-wallets
have been opened till date, he said, adding that numbers will improve significantly. The infrastructure of
payment systems and branch network is also showing an increasing growth trend, he said adding that
the ATMs network has increased to 6,232 whereas branch network has reached 11,600 while 94
percent of our branches are now real time on-line. ‘Similarly, the number of plastic cards has increased

Finance Minister & SBP Governor meet with MD IMF Lagarde

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and SBP Governor Yaseen Anwar had a private audience with MD IMF Mrs
Lagarde on Sunday, October 13, 2013—a recognition of the importance and attention to Pakistan.

Mr. Ishaq Dar, while conveying his gratitude for the support given by the MD and her team for
approving the EFF Program Facility for Pakistan, outlined the major bold and robust structural reforms
the government had initiated that would steer the country towards sustained economic stability.
Senator Dar articulated the vital energy reforms underway, steps being undertaken to reduce the fiscal
deficit going forward, improving significantly the Tax/GDP ratio, addressing the low 14%
Investment/GDP ratio, the privatization process of key public sector entities, and improving overall
corporate governance.

Senator Dar also underscored Pakistan's commitment to strict discipline in meeting the benchmarks of
the IMF facility. This was already evident when Pakistan not only met all actions required prior to the
IMF Board approval on September 4, 2013 but also in meeting the very aggressive benchmarks as of
quarter end September 30th in a matter of 26 days. These actions demonstrate the country's
commitment and ability to meet the IMF conditions and move towards an improved economy. He also
highlighted how market sentiment had improved and that offshore investor confidence in Pakistan was
very upbeat that would translate into FDI inflows, thereby improving our Balance of Payments. Mrs
Lagarde expressed her satisfaction and was pleased to see the positive progress initiated by Pakistan
which she follows closely.

SBP Governor informed the MD of the recognized global leadership role SBP had played in recent years
in establishing the regulatory framework for microfinance and branchless banking in order to provide
huge unbanked sector the basic financial products to those who do not have access to finance. He
articulated SBP's role in Financial Inclusion, Bank-led models that currently comprise over 94,000 agent
network providing payment services, and the National Financial Literacy Program that also focuses on
educating women so they have access to basic financial products. These successes in Pakistan's financial
inclusion strategy are a major step towards supporting growth in the economy as well as poverty
alleviation. Due to her personal interest in promoting growth and poverty alleviation, Mrs Lagarde was
pleased to hear of Pakistan's success and indicated her support.

Given Mrs Lagarde's busy schedule during the annual IMF meetings, this private meeting is recognition
of Pakistan's important role as a member country.

SBP pursuing multi-pronged strategy to tackle the challenge
of financial exclusion in Pakistan: Yaseen Anwar

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has said that the SBP is pursuing a multi-
pronged approach to tackle the challenge of high financial exclusion in the country. ‘In
particular, SBP is aiming to develop an efficient and sustainable market-based financial structure
meeting the financial needs of the marginalized population of the country including women and
young people,’ he said while addressing the Closure Ceremony of Term Finance (Sarmaya)
Certificate (TFC) of Tameer Microfinance Bank at a local hotel in Karachi this afternoon.

He said that the issuance of this TFC will go a long way in diversifying funding for the
microfinance sector. ‘I strongly encourage all the financial market players to develop a long
term vision for making the financial sector in Pakistan more inclusive,’ SBP Governor added.

Mr. Anwar observed that the estimated microfinance market of 25-30 million clients may not
necessarily just need credit services. ‘It is of utmost importance that the industry should aim to
provide holistic and appropriate financial services, including deposit, credit, insurance and
remittance services,’ he said, adding that the SBP is well aware of the fact that the industry is
beset with a number of challenges in the way of achieving this high objective. ‘SBP is actively
engaged with all stakeholders to address the sector specific challenges in a sustainable manner,’
he said.

He noted that the financial sector in Pakistan remains restricted in its outreach both in terms of
its depth and breadth. According to the Access to Finance Study of 2008, hardly 12% of the
population has access to formal banking services and another 32% is informally served whereas
56% of the adult population is totally excluded, he said adding that similarly in Pakistan, the
estimated size of the microfinance market is in the range of 25-30 million clients which indicates
that the current level of microfinance access at 2.4 million clients is only 10% of the potential
market.

Mr. Anwar said that the SBP with the help of UK’s DFID had launched the Microfinance Credit
Guarantee Facility (MCGF) in 2008 to match the massive scarcity of funding to the majority of
the microfinance market. ‘Prior to the launching of this Facility, and apart from one-off funding
deals between the few Microfinance (MF) providers and commercial banks, the commercial
funding market was nonexistent for microfinance providers and the microfinance industry was
severely handicapped and highly donor dependent for its funding needs,’ he added.

SBP Governor said the scope of the Facility has recently been enhanced to allow microfinance
providers to mobilize non-bank financing from capital markets, further diversifying sources of

Economy continues to face fiscal and external challenges in Q3-FY13: SBP Quarterly Report

State Bank of Pakistan released its Third Quarterly Report for FY13 on the State of Economy, today.
The Report says that key challenges to macroeconomic management emanated from fiscal as well as
external sectors. After a surplus during the first half of FY 13, the current account position
deteriorated to a deficit in the third quarter, creating some pressure on the country’s foreign exchange
reserves. On the domestic front, the growth in FBR tax revenues remained sluggish, while
expenditures on power subsidies and debt servicing increased sharply. The government had to resort
increasingly to borrowing from SBP to finance its fiscal deficit.

The Report also notes some positive developments including a significant decline in inflation and
some signs of recovery in large-scale manufacturing. Revival in large scale manufacturing was
supported by loans disbursed by banks to the private sector businesses, and higher production of
sugar, POL, cement, fertilizer, and cotton yarn.

However, agriculture was adversely affected by heavy rains and localized floods during the Kharif
season, and services sector also remained subdued. In overall terms, growth in real GDP is estimated
at 3.6 percent in FY13 compared with 4.4 percent last year (this is at rebased GDP data).

The Report highlights that while inflation has continued to decline and registered a recent low,
deterioration on the external front, or an increase in administered prices (to minimize subsidies and
arrest the size of the circular debt required for fiscal consolidation), pose main risks to inflation in the
medium term. In the absence of these risks, inflation is likely to remain subdued.

According to the Report, the fiscal situation has worsened because of subsidies and rising interest
payments. The amount of subsidies paid during the first three quarters of FY 13, significantly
exceeded the full year target. Furthermore, debt servicing has surpassed development expenditures.
These two heads (i.e., subsidies and debt servicing) together constitute around 40 percent of total
current expenditures. On the revenue side, growth in FBR tax collection during Jul-Mar FY13 was
the lowest since FY02.

However, the availability of US$ 1.8 billion of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) and surpluses generated
by the provinces helped the government contain its 9-month deficit. Nevertheless, SBP projects the
full year budget deficit in the range of 7 — 7.5 percent of GDP, due to continuing pressure of subsidies
and interest payments, and sluggish revenue collection by FBR.

The Report also points out difficulties faced by the government in financing the fiscal deficit. As
external financing dried up completely, the government continued to rely on the domestic banking
system to finance its fiscal deficit. More worryingly, domestic borrowing was skewed towards short-
term financing, which raises concerns about the sustainability of Pakistan’s public debt, which has
already reached Rs 13.9 trillion as of end-March 2013.

According to the FRDL Act (2005), the government must achieve a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 60
percent by end FY13. However, given the pace of recent increase in the fiscal deficit (and resulting
rise in public debt), the government is unlikely to achieve this target. The Report states that SBP has
been flagging this fact that the rise in the debt stock accompanied by debt servicing, directly adds to
subsequent fiscal deficits — this shows the increased risk of entering a debt-deficit spiral.

In addition to the challenges on the fiscal front, the SBP Report also notes pressure on Pakistan’s
external account after the first half of FY13, with a current account deficit of US$ 1.3 billion in Q3-
FY13 alone. Also for rest of FY 13, the external outlook remains a source of concern with scheduled

Financial System must play a more meaningful role in the
economic development of the country: Yaseen Anwar

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Yaseen Anwar has observed that the financial system in
Pakistan is yet to grow to its full potential and play a more meaningful role in the economic
development of the country.

Delivering his speech on ‘Developing Non-Bank Financial Models while addressing the risks of Shadow
Banking’ at the SECP Conference on Non-Bank Financial Institutions at a local hotel in Karachi today, he
said that we definitely need to add to its diversification and depth. NBFls can play a meaningful role in
this pursuit, he said, adding that in the light of the global financial crises, we are better informed about
the various risks that the NBFls/Shadow Banking carries with it. ‘As regulators we need to remain
vigilant to ensure that those risks are mitigated without inhibiting sustainable non-banking financing
models,’ he said.

Mr. Anwar said that while the overall assets of the financial sector in Pakistan have increased from
Rs. 5.202 trillion in 2005 to Rs. 11.107 trillion in 2011, the share of the financial sector in terms of GDP is
very low at 57.4 percent. He said that in 2011, Banks held 74 percent of the financial assets while the
share of NBFls was only 4.7 percent of the total financial sector assets which was around 7.6 percent in
2005. ‘The low financial sector to GDP ratio and NBFls declining share in financial sector assets clearly
underscores the need for financial sector development and diversification of financial sector assets to
attract investors with different return expectations and risk appetite and channelize financial resources
for the economic development of the country,’ he observed.

The “shadow banking system” is defined as “the system of credit intermediation that involves entities
and activities outside the regular banking system”, he said, adding that the emergence of the term
reflected recognition of the increased importance of entities and activities structured outside the
regular banking system that perform bank-like functions.

SBP Governor briefly outlined the following four major constraints that the NBFI sector in Pakistan is
beset with:

— First, although there has been an increasing effort by NBFls to broaden the range of their
business activities and product base, thereby diversifying their revenue streams, the sector is
yet to make a breakthrough in this regard.

— Second, the sector is fragmented and each NBFI is trying to create its niche market in pursuit of
establishing a sustainable revenue stream. In this regard, most companies are concentrating on
financial advisory and other fee-based income segments. Unfortunately, the sector is yet to
capitalize on the huge opportunities offered by previously relatively untapped areas like SMEs,
Consumer, and Agriculture segments to enhance avenues for fund deployment.

— Third, the sector needs to develop and diversify sources of funding for sustainable growth. This
would require a shift from the traditional sources such as commercial banks credit lines etc. for

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today reduced the refinance rate and services charges
on its various financing schemes with the exception of financing for over five years and up to
ten years.

The rate of refinance under the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) has been reduced by 0.2%
to 8.30% p.a. Exporters will now get the financing facility from banks at 9.30% p.a. while service
charges under the Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) have been reduced by 0.70% for financing
up to 3 years and by 0.20% for financing up to five years. However, the service charges for
financing up to 10 years have been raised by 0.20% p.a.

The service charges under the Scheme for Financing Power Plants Using Renewable
Energy have also been reduced by 0.20% p.a. for financing up to five years. However, the
service charges for financing up to ten years have been raised by 0.20%.

It has been decided that rate of refinance under the Export Finance Scheme applicable
from January 01, 2013 and onward will be 8.30% p.a. till further instructions. The commercial
banks shall ensure that where financing facilities are extended by them to the exporters for
availing refinance facilities under the Export Finance Scheme, their maximum margin/spread
does not exceed 1% p.a., says IH&SMEFD Circular No.1 of the New Year.

The revised reduced markup rate would also be applicable on outstanding loans granted
under EFS. Accordingly, banks are advised to immediately re-price their outstanding loans
granted under EFS, keeping in view the revised reduced markup rate. Simultaneously, SBP BSC
offices would also apply reduced markup on outstanding refinance loans granted under EFS. In
order to reconcile the position of re-priced loans, banks should submit particulars of
outstanding loans re-priced by the bank under EFS on prescribed format to the concerned SBP
BSC office(s) within 10 days from 1 January, 2013.

The reimbursement of mark-up rate benefit to exporters, on excess performance under

SBP launches Livestock Insurance Scheme for borrowers

The State Bank of Pakistan, in collaboration with SECP, banks, insurance companies and
provincial livestock & dairy departments, has developed a framework for Livestock Insurance for
borrowers. It is aimed at improving access to finance to the livestock & dairy sector by mitigating risk of
loss of livestock due to disease, natural calamities & accidents.

The livestock sector contributes 55% in Agriculture GDP and 11.4% to the overall GDP. It is an
important tool for poverty alleviation and for raising the living standards of the poor especially in rural
areas. However, banks’ financing to Livestock/Dairy & meat is only Rs 56 billion which constitutes 17% of
total agri. lending of Rs. 336 billion in 2012-13. One of the major reasons for modest off take of credit to
this sector is the limited availability of appropriate insurance products or other risk mitigation tools.

Livestock Insurance Scheme will provide an essential risk mitigating tool to encourage banks to
enhance flow of credit to this highly potential and underserved sector. The scheme would safeguard the
interest of farmer borrowers in case of death due to disease, accident, flood, heavy rains and storm of
their dairy, milch or fattening animals i.e. buffaloes, cows & bulls. Under the Scheme, banks will obtain
insurance of all livestock loans up to Rs. 5 million for the purchase of animals.

SBP has advised banks to implement the scheme as per given parameters and enter into
agreements with reputable insurance companies for underwriting livestock insurance for their
borrowers. Further, banks may also negotiate with insurance companies for best terms vis-a-vis
insurance coverage for disability and theft of animal, premium rate etc. as per mutual arrangement.

SBP will request Government of Pakistan to bear the cost of insurance premium of small farmers
through budgetary support as is being done under the Government’s mandatory Crop Loan Insurance
Scheme for five major crops. As per SBP classification, farmers having up to 20 cows/buffaloes and 50
fattening cattle are categorized as small farmers.

Kazi Abdul Muktadir urges upon financial industry to take steps
for promoting SMEs through innovative banking solutions

The Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Kazi Abdul Muktadir has urged upon
the financial industry to take steps for promoting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

through prudent and more innovative banking solutions.

Inaugurating a three-day Training Program on ‘Scaling Up SME Banking Business’,
arranged by the State Bank of Pakistan, in collaboration with International Finance Corporation
(IFC), at a local hotel in Karachi today, he said the banks should formulate strategies to

overcome the challenges faced by the SME sector.

‘Banks need to shift from traditional banking approach towards SMEs to the provision of
more customized and differentiated financial products and services to suit different SME
segments, he said, adding that they also need to develop and implement appropriate credit
evaluation techniques used globally such as credit scoring, cash flow-based lending and

program-based lending.

Mr. Abdul Muktadir pointed out that the SME sector contributes 30 percent towards
GDP, employs more than 70 percent of the non-agricultural workforce and generates 25
percent in the export earnings of the country. ‘However, despite its significance, the growth of
SME sector in Pakistan remains constrained by a number of factors on both the demand and

supply side,’ he added.

He pointed out that lending figures of SMEs are not encouraging in recent years and said
the bank’s credit to SMEs has declined over the last 4 years from Rs 437 billion in 2007 to Rs
248 billion in June, 2012. With this decline, the SMEs’ loan proportion to the total advances of
banks has also decreased from 16 percent in 2007 to less than 8% percent in 2012, he said,

State Bank issues revised Prudential Regulations for SME Financing

The State Bank of Pakistan issued revised Prudential Regulations (PRs) for Small and Medium
Enterprise (SME) financing today, to ensure smooth flow of funds to the sector. The revised
PRs focus more on Small Enterprise, and formulate more specific and simpler regulations for
them.

The new set of Regulations is believed to further improve the current Regulatory
Environment and will boost the efforts to meet financing needs of SMEs. The revised
regulations underscore importance of cash flow analysis and other tools assessing the
primary source of repayment of SME borrowers. It also emphasizes the use of technology and
documentation for disciplined credit control for monitoring of credit quality.

Since Medium Enterprises are relatively less credit constrained in accessing loans compared
to Small Enterprises, the Regulations governing them have not been changed. However, the
definition for Medium Enterprises has been changed and their individual & aggregate
borrowing limits revised upwardly.

After review, the SME Prudential Regulations have now the following structure:
i. General Prudential Regulations that apply on both Small and Medium Enterprises
ii. Specific Prudential Regulations for Small Enterprise Financing
iii. Specific Prudential Regulations for Medium Enterprise Financing
The Revised PRs are applicable with immediate effect for the fresh financing facilities. However,
since the banks/DFls need to segregate their existing SME portfolio according to the new
definitions and revised classification criteria, Banks/DFls are allowed a maximum

implementation period up to September 30, 2013 for the existing portfolio.

The new set of Prudential Regulations can be accessed at SBP web-site http://www.sbp.org.pk.

SBP Releases Payment System Review of 4"" Quarter FY13

More than 300 ATMs were installed and dozens of bank branches added to the online branch

State Bank keeps Policy Rate unchanged at 9.5 percent

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 9.5 percent. The decision
was taken by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting held under the chairmanship of
Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today.

The decision to keep the policy rate unchanged was taken in view of the fact that the balance of
payments position continues to be driven by low financial inflows and high debt payments. While the
external current account deficit is expected to widen further in the remaining months of FY13, the net
capital and financial inflows are not likely to increase considerably. In addition, the SBP has to retire
another $838 million of IMF loans during the remaining period of FY13 after making payments of $2.2
billion during the first three quarters of the current fiscal year. Due to these developments, the pressure
on foreign exchange reserves is likely to remain in the coming months.

It was also observed by the Board that contrary to expectations, the year-on-year inflation has come
down by 1.5 percentage points; from 8.1 percent in January 2013 to 6.6 percent in March 2013 posing
divergent policy choices for the SBP. While the balance of payments position calls for caution, the
declining trend in inflation indicates a possible resumption of ease in the policy rate.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

In the monetary policy statement of February 2013, the SBP highlighted two main challenges for
monetary policy: to manage the balance of payment position and to contain the possible increase in
inflation. Since then, SBP’s foreign exchange reserves have declined by another $2 billion; from 8.7
billion at end-January 2013 to $6.7 billion as of 5th April 2013, mainly due to debt payments. Contrary to
expectations, however, year-on-year inflation has come down by 1.5 percentage points; from 8.1
percent in January 2013 to 6.6 percent in March 2013. These developments pose divergent policy
choices for the SBP. While the former calls for caution, the latter indicates a possible resumption of ease
in the policy rate.

The balance of payments position continues to be driven by low financial inflows and high debt
payments. A cumulative net capital and financial inflow of $34 million during July — February, FY13 is
insufficient to finance the external current account deficit of $700 million for the same period. While the
external current account deficit is expected to widen further in the remaining months of FY13, the net
capital and financial inflows are not likely to increase considerably. It is important to emphasize that it is
not the size of the external current account deficit, which is projected to be small and manageable, but
the lack of adequate financial inflows that is exerting pressure on the balance of payments.

In addition, the SBP has to retire another $838 million of IMF loans during the remaining period of FY13
after making payments of $2.2 billion during the first three quarters of the current fiscal year. Thus, the
pressure on foreign exchange reserves is likely to remain in the coming months. So far the SBP has
played an active role in managing the conditions, but only a consistent increase in foreign exchange can

Executives of all Primary Dealers through a Circular (DMMD Circular No.3 dated February 14) which is
available on SBP website.

It may be mentioned here that the secondary market trading of Government of Pakistan (GOP)
securities is already being done on Electronic Bond Trading Platform (EBND) since January 2010, which
has enhanced the visibility and price discovery of government securities. The introduction of primary
market auction will further complement and augment the capabilities of Fixed Income market of
Pakistan, as liquid and vibrant government securities market provides strong foundation for the
development of debt markets.

The total volume and value of transactions processed during the quarter has jumped by
16% to 41.1 million and by 13% to Rs.171 billion respectively. This growth in transactions is

The fast growing network of BB agents has reached to 64,716 as of 31° Mar. 2013 from
41,567 as on 31"" Dec. 2012 registering an increase of 56 percent. This growth in agents’ network
is largely owed to new players (Mobicash and Timepey).

According to the Newsletter, domestic fund transfers through OTC (P2P) remains the
dominant category with 59 percent share in value and 36 percent in number of transactions
performed by the customers. Growth in m-wallets has been driven by G2P accounts as 75
percent of the total 295,138 accounts registered during the quarter belong to G2P beneficiaries.
G2P welfare payments worth of Rs. 5.5 billion have been disbursed through BB channels during

Mr. Yaseen Anwar stresses upon the need to develop & implement
good governance practices to promote economic growth

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan has stressed upon the need to develop and
implement good governance practices in order to provide impetus to economic growth.

‘Emphasis on good corporate governance regimes cannot be underscored more as it creates an
attractive investment climate necessary to maintain investors’ confidence, resulting in positive impact
on the share price and creating possibilities for raising low cost Capital,’ he said while speaking as a Chief
Guest at ‘The Success of Executive MBA of 2012’ held at IBA (Main Campus) in Karachi this evening.

The complexities arising in the eco-system of any business may arise in the shape of macro economic
imbalances that include sagging demand, inflation, volatility in financial markets, etc., he said, adding
that while demanding situations on the internal front arise from personnel management, investment
ambiguity that there are always complex matrices linking external challenges with internal ones and
therefore, successful business leaders will never make internal business decisions in isolation. ‘An
uniformed business leader is a leader without a vision and quite likely without any success,’ he said.

SBP Governor said the present turmoil in the financial sector provides an opportunity to learn from the
financial world’s mistakes and overzealousness. ‘I feel the most significant lesson that we have learnt
from recent events is the importance of fundamentals in risk management. ‘For instance, there is a
basic rule since inception of banks which says ‘do not put all your eggs in one basket’. Had this simple
rule been followed, many institutions could have avoided huge losses,’ he added.

He asked the MBA Executives to focus on establishing a system that actively promotes ethical decision
making — one that can act as a deterrent to unethical, illegal and harmful practices within the institution.
‘Remember, as future executives, you will have a fiduciary duty towards shareholders, employees,
clients and society as a whole. More often than not, their interests will not be aligned and you will need
to make extremely tough choices,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar told the MBA Executives that they are the leaders of tomorrow and added: ‘I’d like to present
another challenge as you step into the world of business. | challenge you to change the way business is
done here. | challenge you to create an organization that can survive, and indeed thrive in the
challenging business environment we face today. | challenge you to create the organization that will
become the face of Pakistan abroad. And | challenge you to do all this while remaining true to your own
values, your own personal ethos, and while remaining servants to the people of this nation so that you
may be able to take better, well-informed and principled decisions.’

Dr. Ishrat Husain, Director and Dean of IBA also spoke on the occasion.

Economy showing mixed picture halfway into FY13

State Bank of Pakistan released its first and second quarterly reports for FY13 on the
State of Economy, today. According to the two reports that jointly cover
developments in Pakistan’s economy for July — December FY 13, some of the positive
developments experienced by the economy in Q1-FY13 could not be sustained
during the second quarter. Although the current account still posted a surplus in the
first half of FY13, the second quarter posted a deficit; the downward trend in
inflation in the first five months of FY13 was interrupted in December; and the
federal government sharply increased its reliance on SBP financing in the second
quarter. The reports further mentioned that persistent structural problems continue
to burden the economy.

The real sector is showing a mixed picture. Within agriculture, both cotton and rice
crops remained below target, whereas sugarcane performed well. The wheat crop is
likely to be below target despite the increase in support prices in November 2012.

Pakistan’s manufacturing sector on the other hand has posted an improvement, and
is likely to continue with this trend. Heavyweights like POL and steel manufacturing
have shown strong growth. In addition, allied sub-sectors that support construction
activities have shown consistent growth, reflecting strong construction since FY12.

The reports point out that the loans to private businesses showed an expansion of Rs
146.5 billion, compared to Rs 86.1 billion in the corresponding period last year, which
indicates that banks have started shifting their attention to the private sector.

In terms of federal government borrowing, the aggregated numbers show the
government has borrowed less from the banking system this fiscal year, but there
has been a sharp shift away from commercial banks to SBP during Q2-FY13.

The fiscal picture explains the federal government’s compulsion to borrow. Although
the consolidated fiscal deficit in H1-FY13 is likely to be 2.6 percent of GDP (which is
the same as in H1-FY12), the USS 1.8 billion inflow on account of Coalition Support
Fund (CSF) made all the difference. The FBR revenue collection witnessed an
increase of only 5.7 percent, against a 27.1 percent increase in the same period last
year. Furthermore, current expenditures of the federal government grew by 30.9
percent in H1-FY13, compared to 6.6 percent last year.

The reports pointed out that Pakistan’s domestic debt has increased by Rs 691 billion
in the first half of FY13 compared to Rs 854 billion in the first half of FY12. However,
Pakistan’s external public debt actually fell by USS 1.9 billion during the half year (of

State Bank keeps policy rate unchanged at 9.50%: Yaseen Anwar

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 9.50% but reduced the interest
rate corridor by 50 bps. The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar while unveiling the Monetary
Policy Statement (MPS) at a press conference at SBP Learning Resource Centre, Karachi, said the decision to keep
the policy rate unchanged and reduce the interest corridor from 300 bps to 250 bps was taken at a meeting of the
Central Board of Directors of SBP held under his chairmanship in Karachi today. The decision to reduce the interest
rate corridor was taken with the objective of improving transmission mechanism by minimizing short-term
volatility in interest rates and to bring more transparency, he added.

He said the macroeconomic conditions weakened during H1-FY13 despite improvement in some key indicators.
The CPI inflation came down quite sharply till November 2012 but has increased since then, he said, adding that
the external current account posted a surplus during H1-FY13 but the foreign exchange reserves have declined,
predominantly due to IMF repayments. ‘The non tax revenues of the government received a boost after receiving
Coalition Support Fund (CSF) of 0.7 percent of GDP during H1-FY13, yet the fiscal deficit is expected to miss the
budgeted target by a wide margin,’ Mr. Anwar added.

Responding to a sharply declining inflation and, assigning a higher weight to contracting private investment, he
said the SBP lowered its policy rate by a cumulative 450 basis point over the last 18 months. ‘SBP has also ensured
that both the money and the foreign exchange markets remain stable. It also introduced certain measures to
improve the liquidity management and financial intermediation aspects of the banking sector,’ he added.

In the wake of rising risks to macroeconomic stability and in the absence of structural reforms that could have
supported price stability and growth in medium term, it may be difficult to continue with the same monetary
policy stance, he said, adding that the SBP has to be forward looking and take steps to meet the emerging
challenges. ‘The two main challenges, from the point of view of SBP, are managing the balance of payment
position and containing the resurgence of inflationary pressures,’ Mr. Anwar added.

SBP Governor said the fundamental weakness in the balance of payments is the continuous decline in the net
capital and financial flows. ‘There has been a net outflow of $539 million in this account during H1-FY13. In
addition, the SBP has retired $1.4 billion of IMF loans during the first seven months of FY13. Thus, despite an
external current account surplus of $250 million in H1-FY13, the foreign exchange reserves of SBP have declined to
$8.7 billion as on 31st January 2013 from $10.8 billion at end-June 2012,’ he added.

Mr. Anwar said the surplus in the external current account during H1-FY13 was primarily due to the receipt of $1.8
billion in the CSF and added that marginal improvement in the trade balance and robust growth in workers’
remittances have also helped the external current account balance, mitigating the pressure on the balance of
payments position. ‘The SBP expects the external current account deficit to remain below 1 percent of GDP for
FY13. This is despite little expectation of receiving proceeds of approximately $850 million from the auction of 3G
licence,’ he added.

He observed that in view of the declining trend in financial inflows and a very low probability of receiving the
budgeted privatization inflows of $800 million in FY13, the challenges on the balance of payments position are
unlikely to subside. ‘Further payments of $1.6 billion of IMF loan in the remaining five months of FY13 and $3.2

State Bank reduces policy rate by 50 basis points to 9 percent

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points to bring it
down to 9 percent with effect from 24"" June, 2013.

This was decided by the Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan at its meeting held
under the chairmanship of SBP Governor, Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today.

According to the Monetary Policy Decision, State Bank of Pakistan has decided to place a higher weight
to declining inflation and low private sector credit relative to risks to the balance of payments position.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

There has been a discernible positive change in sentiments post May 2013 elections because of clarity
on the political front. The change in the behavior of banks in auctions of government securities and
reaction of stock market are two examples. Importantly, there has been a considerable improvement in
SBP conducted surveys of consumer confidence, expected economic conditions, and inflation
expectations. The absence of foreign financial inflows and high fiscal borrowings from the banking
system, however, remain formidable economic challenges, especially for monetary policy. Similarly,
power shortages and security conditions continue to be strong impediments to growth.

An almost continuous and broad based deceleration in inflation over the last year has had a favorable
impact on inflation outlook — a key variable in monetary policy decisions. In May 2013, the year-on-year
CPI inflation was 5.1 percent while trimmed measure of core inflation was 6.7 percent; the lowest levels
since October 2009. The average CPI inflation for FY13 is expected to be at least two percentage points
below the target of 9.5 percent.

However, in the latest budget the government has announced an increase of 1 percentage point in the
General Sales Tax (GST), from 16 percent to 17 percent, and changes in the tax structure for some goods
and services. In addition, the government is considering a phase-wise upward adjustment in electricity
tariff. The exact magnitude and timing of this adjustment is yet to be decided. Therefore, there is a risk
that average inflation for FY14 could exceed the announced target of 8 percent for the year. However,
aggregate demand in the economy is expected to remain moderate, which could have a dampening
effect on inflation.

A reflection of the current declining trend in inflation can be seen in the muted real economic activity,
especially private investment expenditures. Beset by energy shortages and law and order conditions, the
GDP growth has struggled to ameliorate in the last few years and this year was no exception. The
provisional estimate of GDP growth for FY13 is 3.6 percent, which is lower than the 4.3 percent target
for the year. Similarly, private fixed capital formation has decreased by 1.8 percent — the fifth

Dr. Ha-Joon Chang Highlights Role of State in Economic
Development

Dr. Ha-Joon Chang, Member, Faculty of Economics & Centre of Development Studies at
University of Cambridge has said that protection to the industries in developing countries does
not guarantee growth. ‘This will happen only when state ensures conscious investments in
capability-enhancing activities — investments in machinery, training, and R&D.’ He was
delivering a lecture on ""Rethinking the Role of the State in Economic Development"" at Pakistan

National Council of Arts (PNCA), Islamabad today.

The lecture, organised by the State Bank of Pakistan, was the 19th such event held as a part of
Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture series instituted in 1973 in the name of its first Governor, Mr.

Zahid Husain.

Dr. Ha-Joon Chang laid emphasis on the significance of the role of state in economic

development beyond the conventional wisdom.

“Ramping up competition through liberalisation of trade and FDI is not enough for enhancing
productivity. If the gap between the productive capabilities of the domestic producers and
those of foreign producers is too large, those liberalisation measures can wipe out domestic
producers, rather than make them shape up. This suggests that those policies should be

calibrated according to the existing capability gap and gradually introduced”, he emphasized.

While pinning down the role of state, he pointed out that enhancement of productive
capabilities require putting emphasis on exports, especially in developing countries. “This is
because, given their technological backwardness, they need to import machines and
technology licences from abroad, which in turn requires that they have enough foreign
exchanges. But to repeat, this does not mean free trade — export subsidies (including

government marketing support) and infant industry protection are needed for export success.”

Mr. Yaseen Anwar outlines 10-point banking strategy
for robust growth of financial system in Pakistan

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Yaseen Anwar has outlined the Central Bank’s 10-
point banking strategy for the growth of the financial system in the country. This strategy focuses on: (i)
to implement a financial inclusion program for underserved economic sectors of the country; (ii) to
strengthen consumer protection through legislation and codes of conduct; (iii) to strengthen competition
and efficiency with greater transparency; (iv) to consolidate the banking sector’s corporate governance
and risk management practices; (v) to strength prudential regulations & supervision of banks; (vi) to
introduce consolidated supervision frameworks that supervise financial groups and conglomerates; (vii) to
develop a safety nets for small depositors, unviable institutions and unforeseen market crises; (viii) to
strengthen the Bank’s powers to maintain monetary and financial stability by updating the SBP Act
regularly; (ix) to deepen the financial sector by developing debt markets, stock markets and NBFIs; and
(x) to develop the financial infrastructure, including payment systems and credit information systems to
facilitate transactions.

Speaking on the ‘Role of Financial Institutions and Capital Markets in Pakistan’s Economy’ at PAF Air
War College, Karachi today, he said: ‘I want to emphasize that all these measures are focused at creating
an efficient, competitive, and robust financial system that can provide the impetus for faster economic
growth, while guarding the interests of all stakeholders involved. That, in a nutshell, is all we seek to do.’

The State Bank has a dual mandate: it must tackle the issue of maintaining price stability, while also
keeping an eye on economic growth, he said, adding that we need to pay close attention to both monetary
stability and fuller utilization of the country’s resources.

He said the State Bank’s constant monitoring of the banking sector’s portfolio has meant that today our
banks are profitable, extremely healthy and robust.

He emphasized that a smooth, well-oiled financial system can ensure that monetary policy signals are
transmitted effectively into the economy.

Mr. Yaseen Anwar said the World Bank, and renowned publications, the Financial Times and The
Economist, have recognized the State Bank’s role in promoting innovative solutions, especially in
microfinance, to get more people into the banking sector.

SBP Governor said the State Bank regulates the economy as a whole by using monetary policy
instruments, which are transmitted through the financial sector. ‘The potency of our monetary policy
instruments depends on how many people are actively using formal channels of borrowing and lending,’
he added.

He said the State Bank’s monetary policy tools have become much more potent since the introduction of
secondary markets that trade government securities, and the removal of distortions from within these
markets.

Explaining as to how monetary policy works in Pakistan, Mr. Yaseen Anwar said that monetary policy
tools target the interest rate. ‘It’s important to understand just how they do that. Different central banks
use different tactics, but at the State Bank, we intervene primarily in the overnight interbank market. This

State Bank raises Policy Rate to 10 percent

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to raise policy rate by 50 basis points to 10 percent. The
decision was taken by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting held under the chairmanship
of Governor Mr. Yaseen Anwar in Karachi today.

An increase in inflation while keeping the market interest rates at the current level can increase the
incentive for borrowings and discourage savings in the economy. This can potentially increase demand
pressure through consumption as well as dampen investment, and thus the productive capacity of the
economy. In addition, with fragile external flows, negative real return can encourage outflow of foreign
exchange increasing the pressure on exchange rate.

Following is the complete text of the Monetary Policy Decision:

While the challenges for macroeconomic stability in the external sector remain, the fundamentals of the
economy going forward in the backdrop of the recent policy and reform measures appear stable.
Notwithstanding rising inflation, the prospects of an economic revival inspired by successful political
transition and the resolution of energy related circular debt issue are encouraging. To ensure the
economy remains on a stable path, further structural reforms are in progress. Although, it is too early to
conclude about their impact, there are some indications of a pickup in economic activity. The growth in
LSM has accelerated with a year on year increase of 8.4 percent during Q1-FY14. Similarly, exports have
also marginally picked up, growing at 1.3 percent in Q1-FY14.

The deterioration in the external accounts has continued in FY14, largely on account of weak financial
inflows. The external current account had a deficit of $1.2 billion in Q1-FY14, similar to that witnessed in
the previous quarter. With imports picking up at a relatively higher pace than exports, the widening of
the trade deficit mainly explains this. Moreover, the financial account balance had a net outflow of $68
million. Further, taking into account substantial repayments to the IMF, SBP reserves declined by $1.3
billion during Q1-FY14. The SBP reserves stand at $4.2 billion as of Ist November 2013.

Besides these fundamental factors, the speculative sentiments on account of IMF end September 2013
targets resulted in exchange rate volatility. Such sentiments are an attribute of uncertainty over foreign
exchange flows, which are expected to be reduced with sustainable improvement in the external
accounts. In this regard, the progress on reforms part of the IMF program is likely to play a critical role.
For instance, the resolution of the energy related circular debt issue has resulted in improved supply of
electricity, which is helpful for the growth in exports.

Successful completion of structural benchmarks under the IMF program will also ensure additional
financial inflows from other IFls. In the absence of such reforms, the burden of adjustment falls
disproportionately higher on interest and exchange rates that may perpetuate speculative sentiments in
the market.

Small Enterprises/farmers get Rs 2.83 bln bank
financing under SBP Credit Guarantee Scheme

The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) has helped small enterprises
and farmers to access Rs 2.83 billion in bank financing over the last 18 months.

The Scheme (CGS) has facilitated financing in 105 districts across the country with 85 percent of
loans provided to previously un-served/under-served clients in rural areas, of which 81 percent
were subsistence farmers. Similarly, 91% of the loans under the Scheme were provided to small
businesses with less than five employees of which 90 percent were sole proprietors.

Under the CGS, banks also focused on serving the lower end of the commercial banking market
through smaller loans, with an average loan size of Rs 390,000 for agriculture and Rs 2.1 million
for small enterprises. Based on client needs, the loan tenor under the CGS ranged from less
than one year to three years.

The Scheme through its support to previously unbanked small rural enterprises is likely to
further enhance economic opportunities and increase employment in the rural areas of the
country.

The Technical Committee during its annual review of the Scheme observed that despite the
extensive geographic spread and a focus on under-banked segments, the participating banks
demonstrated prudent lending practices reflected in an infection ratio of only 2.91 percent for
agriculture and 1.07 percent for small enterprise loan portfolios, which are much lower than
the industry averages.

It may be pointed out that the CGS is monitored by the Technical Committee drawing
membership from the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), SBP and the
Pakistan Banks Association (PBA). The Scheme introduced by SBP in 2010 with the financial
assistance of DFID under the Financial Inclusion Program (FIP) and Government of Pakistan with
the objective to increase the flow of financing to small and rural enterprises that have limited
access to financial services from the formal financial system. The Scheme has so far supported
nine banks including big five banks which were selected after due screening by the Committee.

SBP welcomes Bank of China International CEO/Chairperson in Islamabad

“Closer Cooperation in the banking sector will assist in strengthening relationship further with
China. Number of mega projects which huge Chinese companies are implementing in Pakistan
necessitates smooth and efficient banking arrangements to meet the banking needs”, this was the
core message conveyed by the Acting Governor/Deputy Governor of State Bank of Pakistan Mr.
Saeed Ahmad in a meeting welcoming the Chief Executive Officer Ms Li Tong of Bank of China
International (BoCI). BoCI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of China.

BoCl is the investment banking unit of BoC. It is a huge bank with assets over US$ 2.26 trillion
and share capital of US$ 45 billion and presence in 42 countries. It has been a Fortune Global
500 entity for the last two decades

Ms. Li Tong headed a group of more than 20 businessmen including CEO’s of mega companies
to explore further cooperation between Pakistan and China in the field of energy, infrastructure
development, transport, manufacturing, mining and banking. In the meeting at SBP she was
accompanied with Ms. Cheng Yan MD & Vice Chairman, Mr. Michae Cheng and Mr. Wang Jia
and local representatives. Mr. Saeed Ahmad highlighted the close and very special relationship
which exists between Pakistan and China covering a number of important areas. The Pakistan-
China Economic Corridor and Joint Cooperation Committee are the hall mark of deepening
friendship. This was recently got strengthened by the visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to
China and Chinese Premier’s visit to Pakistan.

The visit by BoCI CEO/Chairperson to SBP in Islamabad was meant to discuss the possibility of
opening a branch of BoCI in Pakistan. Executive Director of State Bank, Muhammad Ashraf
Khan also attended and participated in the meeting. Ms. Tong appreciated the warm reception
extended to her by SBP and the brief given to her about the process and requirements of
establishing a foreign bank, a branch or a subsidiary in Pakistan.

SBP informed her about the close working relationship which exists between People Bank of
China (PBC) — the Central Bank and SBP and the Currency Swap Agreement which has been in
place between the two countries. Ms. Tong was apprised about Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) which has branches in Islamabad and Karachi and in the process of opening the
third branch in Lahore. The experience of ICBC in Pakistan has been good. Though there is no
Pakistani banks’ branch operating in China but negotiations are at advanced stage to establish a
branch of a leading Pakistani bank’s branch there in near future. Mr. Saeed Ahmad reminded
CEO of BoCI that currently Pakistan enjoys the privilege of being a member a group of the
countries which are allowed to participate in the local bond market in China. Also an MoU
signing ceremony in Beijing is scheduled to take place in the last week of October to establish
Asia International Infrastructure Bank for which Pakistan is one of the founding members. The
ceremony will be attended by Finance Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar at a special invitation of
Chinese authorities together with other senior officials from Ministry of Finance.

SBP issues separate housing finance prudential regulations to lay more focus on housing finance

 

SBP has been extending its endeavors to enhance the priority sector lending i.e. Agriculture Credit,
Micro Financing, SME Financing, House Financing, Infrastructure Financing and Exports. Keeping in
view the importance of these sectors, SBP has been creating enabling regulatory environment
through conducive Prudential Regulations (PRs) and market development through positive policy
measures i.e. issuance of guidelines, setting indicative targets, promoting capacity building of
financial institutions etc. These activities have been undertaken at SBP as “Special Initiatives” by the

Deputy Governor, Mr. Saeed Ahmad.

Housing and construction plays an important role in an economy. Around 50 industries and 70
percent of the unskilled labour are associated with construction sector. Housing Finance
supplements radically in long term economic growth via job creation, economic linkages and in

raising living standards of people.

The Housing Finance in Pakistan is relatively very low as compared to our neighbouring countries
and has not been growing at a desired pace. Outreach of Housing Finance in terms of income
groups and geography is very limited. The State Bank of Pakistan has been taking various steps for
promotion and development of this sector. Prudential Regulations relating to Housing Finance
needed to be revised to bring them in line with current needs. Keeping in view specific features of
Housing Finance i.e. tenure, pricing, and collateral arrangements being different from other areas of
consumer financing products, a separate set of Prudential Regulations specifically for Housing

Finance has been issued to give true focus to this area.

Pakistan’s economy grows at 3.6%,
inflation falls to single-digit: SBP Annual Report

Pakistan’s economy grew at 3.6 percent and inflation fell to single-digit in FY13, says the State Bank’s Annual
Report on the State of Economy for the year 2012-13 released today. It said soft global commodity prices,
downward revision in energy prices and a relatively stable exchange rate allowed the average inflation rate to fall to
7.4 percent in FY13, which was much lower than the 9.5 percent target for the year.

According to the report, robust growth in construction activity and capacity enhancement in a few sub-sectors,
supported the industrial sector. Global prices helped contain Pakistan’s import bill, and there was some
improvement in exports. Furthermore, higher than anticipated Coalition Support Fund (CSF) inflows, and modest
growth in worker remittances, reduced the current account deficit to 1.0 percent of GDP in FY13. Notwithstanding
favorable developments, growing security concerns and persistent structural weaknesses continue to impede
economic growth.

SBP report said that challenges in managing public sector enterprises; the need to expand the tax net to untaxed or
under-taxed areas; to contain untargeted subsidies; to tackle theft and leakages in the energy sector; to revitalize the
private sector; and to increase documentation, were largely unaddressed during FY 13.

“In a repeat from the previous year, the budget deficit exceeded the target for FY13 by a wide margin, as the
realized deficit was 8.0 percent of GDP, against a target of 4.7 percent,” said the report. It added that the resulting
pressure to secure financing, dominated policymaking throughout the year. For the third consecutive year, the
energy sector was addressed by paying off the circular debt, which pushed the fiscal deficits above the respective
targets for these years.

The report said that, with inadequate external funding, the onus of financing the fiscal deficit fell entirely on
domestic sources — specifically the banking system. The government borrowed Rs 939.6 billion from commercial
banks, and an additional Rs 506.9 billion from SBP. In effect, Pakistan’s domestic debt increased by Rs 1.9 trillion,
a 24.6 percent increase from the end of FY12.

According to the report, the lack of external inflows also created challenges in financing the relatively small current
account deficit. The financial account recorded a net inflow of only US$ 0.3 billion during the year, compared to
US$ 1.3 billion last year, and US$ 5.1 billion in FY10. This, along with significant repayments to the IMF, pulled
down SBP’s liquid FX reserves to a 55-month low of US$ 6.0 billion by end-June 2013.

According to the report, SBP projects GDP growth in the range of 3.0 - 4.0 percent for FY14, which is higher than
the IMF’s growth forecast of 2.5 - 3.0 percent. While inflation outlook based on October 2013 data, reported earlier,
was in the range of 10.5 to 11.5 percent, a more realistic outlook based on latest data shows average inflation for
FY14 to remain between 10 and 11 percent.

It further said that the approval of a 3-year (US$ 6.64 billion) Extended Fund Facility from the IMF, and expected
financial support from other IFIs, should bring stability to the domestic FX market in FY14.

The detailed Report is available at SBP website www.sbp.org.pk.

“SBP issues guidelines on Value Chain financing to help
Banks increase agri-financing outreach”

State Bank of Pakistan has issued Guidelines on Value Chain Contract Farmer Financing to encourage
banks to extend credit to small and marginalized farmers by leveraging on the strengths of inter-
relationships that exist in the agriculture value chain. These guidelines will serve as a basis for banks to
develop mutually beneficial relationship between the banks, farmers and the value-chain agent.

Contract Farming assumes an extensive number of arrangements along the value chain linking small-
scale farmers to markets by either formal or informal contracts. Value Chain Contract Farmer Financing
schemes are broadly defined as binding arrangements between banks and agri. value chain actors
including producers, processors, aggregators, traders through which a farmer or group of farmers
ensures supply of agricultural products to individual firms. It replaces the traditional collateral
requirements with trade agreements by facilitating coordinated commercial relations between value
chain actors.

The introduction of value chain contract farmer financing scheme will enable farmers to avail financing
from banks backed by processor’s guarantee and in return buyers/processors may get assurance of
getting required quantity and quality of agricultural produce. The guidelines have introduced five
instruments including Trader Credit, Input Supplier Credit, Marketing Company Credit, Lead Firm Credit
and Arthi or Intermediary, besides identifying roles & responsibilities of stakeholders, financing
mechanism, eligibility criteria, types of financing, loan limits, security & collateral, insurance and loan
monitoring mechanism.

It is expected that the guideline would benefit farmers in terms of enhanced productivity in variety of
ways such as availing quality input facilities, adopting new technologies, insurance coverage for
crop/non-crop activities and most importantly assurance of buyer in advance. The processors, traders,
exporters and Artis gains ensured supply of desired quantity of quality produce and bankers are at ease
with assured loan settlement by the VC agents.

Small farmers with up to 5 acre land holding constitute 65% or 5.4 million as against 8.3 million farm
households in the country. Therefore, SBP, in line with government’s efforts to promote access to
finance to small farmers, is working on a number of initiatives that include credit guarantee scheme for
small & marginalized farmers, crop & livestock insurance and warehouse receipt financing.

These guidelines are headway into SBP’s consistent efforts to improve small farmers’ access to finance
to achieve the broader goal of financial inclusion. SBP has advised banks to use the guidelines for
developing their own products for providing credit to contract farmers particularly to those who lack
collateral to offer to the bank. Successful adoption of the guidelines will improve depth and spectrum of
agri-financing to escalate rural household incomes and economic growth of the country. The Circular No.
for these guidelines is AC&MFD Circular No.5 of 2014 dated September 30, 2014. The Guideline and
Circular may be accessed from SBP website

SBP issues Circular for Financial Consumer protection

The Consumer Protection Department (CPD) of State Bank of Pakistan has issued Circular No.4
of 2014 titled as Financial Consumer Protection .The Circular encloses a detailed note on
Financial Consumer Protection, its significance, global developments and bank’s own expected
role viz a viz the Financial Consumer Protection . It is expected that its issuance will transform
Financial Consumer Protection into a principle based adoption rather than a compliance check
for the banks. The Circular requires all Banks/DFIs/MFBs to develop and implement their own
Framework on “Fair Treatment of Consumers” FTC, duly approved by their BODs and
implemented by July 1, 2015. It is expected that the Banks/DFIs/MFBs will inculcate conducive

State Bank of Pakistan in its endeavor to foster Financial Consumer Protection across the
industry has issued several market conduct instructions for banks, however, it has been noticed
that Financial Consumer Protection is perceived to be limited to complaint handling only. In
order to disseminate the real connotation of Financial Consumer Protection, the State Bank of

and the conduct expected from banks and DFls for the advocacy of Financial Consumer
Protection.

SBP keeps policy rate unchanged

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10.0 percent. This was
announced by the Governor SBP, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra while unveiling the Monetary Policy
Statement (MPS) for the next two months at a press conference held at SBP head office, Karachi. The
decision was taken during a meeting of the Central Board of Directors of SBP held under his
chairmanship in Karachi today. Henceforth, the Board has also decided to publish the summary of
minutes of monetary policy proceedings of the Board meeting in four weeks.

According to Mr. Wathra, economic conditions are certainly better at the beginning of FY15 than a year
ago but a detailed assessment of the economy indicates that challenges and vulnerabilities remain.
Continuation of prudent policies and reforms are needed to build on positive developments and to achieve
protracted stability.

Governor SBP stated that SBP is effectively managing market sentiments by supplementing the monetary
policy stance with calibrated liquidity operations in the interbank market, adding that “this has
contributed in achieving stability in the foreign exchange market and in building foreign exchange
reserves.” This has also facilitated the shift in banks’ investment from T-bills to PIBs, improving
domestic debt maturity profile of the government.

Mr. Wathra informed the audience that, despite significant injections by SBP, appetite for liquidity
remained sufficiently high in the market. It resulted in higher short-term interest rates, making rupee
liquidity more expensive. “This reduced pressure on exchange rate as it discouraged speculative holdings
of foreign exchange and made trade financing through foreign currency deposits held by banks more
attractive, ” said Mr. Wathra.

He said that a significant reduction in government borrowings from the banking system is contributing
towards low inflationary expectations and has provided necessary space to the private sector to borrow
from the banking system. However, persistent energy shortages and deteriorating security conditions hint
towards some risks to credit demand.

Governor SBP maintained that sustainability of lower government borrowings from the banking system,
including SBP, is contingent upon further reduction in the fiscal deficit and continuation of external
financing, adding that government needs to watch the fiscal position of FY15 i.e. the revenue side
caustiously.

Mr. Wathra told the audience that the growth in domestic debt during FY14 had decelerated to 14.5
percent, which was significantly lower than the average growth of around 27 percent during the last three
years. “This bodes well from the point of view of country’s risk perception and could help in attracting
investment in the economy.”

Governor SBP reminded the audience that the increase in external borrowings since February 2014 had
provided a much needed respite and short term stability to the balance of payments position. These
foreign inflows resulted in a capital and financial account surplus of $6.1 billion which comfortably

SBP issues guidelines for banking services to visually impaired/blind persons.

State Bank of Pakistan has issued guidelines for banks to facilitate banking services to visually
impaired/blind persons. In order to provide equitable access to banking services, general guidelines
have been framed which contain instructions pertaining to opening and operation of bank account, cash
withdrawal/cheque book facility, Credit Cards, ATM/Debit Cards, phone/internet banking, lockers and
extension of loans.

According to the SBP, across advance global financial jurisdictions, it is illegal to discriminate against
anyone on the basis of disability. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities and Optional Protocol (UNCRPD), to which Pakistan is a ratified signatory since 2011, clearly
commits to the rights of persons with disability and their access to financial services. The Constitution of
Pakistan also provides that all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of
law. Accordingly, it is obligatory on the banks/Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) to make banking/financial
services accessible for people with disabilities especially those who are visually impaired/ blind.

To facilitate these services banks/MFBs have been instructed to arrange printing of all related
stationery, forms/documents etc. in Braille Script within the period of three months from the date of
issuance of the guidelines; make available related stock of stationery at least in a branch of
region/city/town from where the said stock may be procured as and when required by other nearby
branches. Banks are encouraged to collaborate with each other and ensure that in an area where
various banks/MFBs are operating , at least one branch is having Talking ATM for facilitation of visually
challenged persons;

Further details for banks/MFBs and other stakeholders have been provided at SBP’s website.

Future outlook of Islamic banking is positive: Governor SBP

Mr. Yaseen Anwar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan has said the future outlook of the Islamic Banking
industry is very positive. He was speaking today at the Round Table Conference on Islamic Banking Potential of

Pakistan.

He said Islamic finance during the last four decades has witnessed considerable progress at the global front.
Besides the traditional Islamic finance markets of the Middle East, financial centers across various Western
countries are also accepting and recognizing the viability and utility of this alternate financial system. “Islamic
financial institutions are presently catering to most of the financial services needs of various sectors of the

economy,” he added.

Mr. Anwar said that “there are dedicated regulatory, legal and academic institutions at the international

level working and providing support for maintaining the high pace growth of the Islamic finance industry.”

He said that Pakistan, with more than 95 percent Muslim population, and a constitutional obligation of
ensuring a riba free economic system, has had a favorable response to Islamic finance. Pakistan is amongst the
pioneers of Islamic finance as we started planning for nurturing the Shariah compliant financial system way back in
1970s, and made a bold attempt in 1980s to bring the whole banking and financial system in conformity with

Shariah principles.

According to the Governor SBP, the Islamic banking industry has been growing at an impressive annual
growth rate of over 30 percent over the last five years with sustained growth momentum despite significantly
increased base. “Islamic Banking is currently spread across 80 districts of the country with a network of 1200
branches offering Shariah compliant products and services. Islamic banking assets presently constitute almost 10

percent of the overall banking system in the country while in terms of deposits the share is above 10 percent.”

He said that the future outlook of the industry is also very positive with bright prospects of doubling its
market share by 2020.

He highlighted the leading role of the SBP in nurturing Islamic banking in the country on sound footings.
Mr. Anwar said that being the regulator of the banking sector, SBP over the years has introduced and implemented
key regulatory reforms and prudential measures to ensure financial stability and to meet the evolving needs of the

industry.

SBP revises regulations for microfinance banks.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued revised Prudential Regulations
(PRs) for Microfinance Banks (MFBs) to further improve their governance
structure, consumer protection practices, and anti-money laundering
(AML) policies.

Presently, ten MFBs are providing basic financial services to poor and
low-income people in the country. These MFBs are well-capitalized and
owned by diverse and strong sponsors. The revised regulations will
enable these MFBs to prudently manage their operations in the wake of
their recent business growth, technological innovations, and market
infrastructure improvements.

The revised regulations, among other areas, define role and
responsibilities of board of directors, require induction of two
independent directors, and prescribe fit and proper test for the
appointment of key executives of MFBs. MFBs are also required to
improve their consumer protection policies through basic financial
literacy programs, enhanced transparency & disclosures, fair debt
collection practices, and effective complaint redressal mechanism.
Similarly, MFBs will implement comprehensive AML framework covering
areas such as customer identification and verification requirements,
ongoing & enhanced due diligence, record retention, and cash &
suspicious transactions reporting in line with the standards prescribed
by Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Further, instructions in certain
areas of risk management and operations have also been revised.

It is pertinent to mention here that the revised regulatory framework
is in line with SBP’s efforts for promoting long-term, sustainable, and
growth-oriented business models in microfinance sector. This will also
help in further mainstreaming of microfinance into overall banking
system of the country.

Acting Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra
outlines six-point-action plan to boost agri. financing in
the Country

The Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has announced a six-point
action plan for boosting agricultural financing in the country.

Addressing a meeting of Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) at SBP, Karachi today he
outlined his action plan that includes (i) the launch of Financial Innovation Challenge Fund (FICF) in
Rural & Agriculture Finance to foster innovation and test new markets, lower cost of delivery,
streamlining systems and procedures to provide more efficient new ways of meeting the larger demands of
farming community; (ii) launch of country-wide Internship Program for 100 top agri. Graduates to be
funded under the ADB’s Improving Access to Financial Services Endowment Fund; (iii) upward revision
in the provisional agri. disbursement target of Rs 360 billion to Rs 380 billion for 2013-14 in the light of
banks’ encouraging performance in the last two years. The target is 13% higher from Rs 336 billion
disbursed in 2012-13; (iv) banks to be assigned targets for outstanding agri. portfolio and number of
borrowers to have high impact of agri. financing at grass root level from the current year; (v) SBP to make
agricultural finance a key indicator of performance of banks, including Islamic banks, which will be
reflected in their supervisory ratings; and (vi) formulation of a Working Group to review the state of
affairs of small farmers financing and making recommendations for increasing financing to this segment
and also bringing in additional small farmers into formal financing system.

Referring to the potential of agriculture sector in the economic development of Pakistan, Mr. Wathra said
that Pakistan is the 9th largest producer of wheat, 4th largest producer of cotton and 12th largest producer of
rice in the world. ‘Similarly, Pakistan is ranked one of the top ten largest producers in minor agriculture
commodities. Pakistan ranks 8th worldwide in farm output’, he added.

Mr. Wathra said that agri. finance is close to his heart as he comes from an agriculturist background. ‘Hence
it has become one of his top priorities since he joined it (SBP)’, he added.

He also urged the farmers’ representatives and government departments to contribute in the efforts of banks
and address the demand side bottlenecks including low yield, proper marketing & storage, water
efficiencies, land record management, adoption of modern techniques, mechanization and other agri.
innovations.

Mr. Wathra said that despite structural shift towards industrialization, agriculture sector continues to remain
the vital sector of our economy with its backward and forward linkages with other sectors of the economy
having strong socio-economic implications. ‘It is the second largest sector, accounting for over 21% of
GDP’, he added.

He shared with the audience some of the key initiatives taken recently by SBP. State Bank of Pakistan has
revised Prudential Regulations (PRs) for Agriculture Financing whereby banks have been urged to formulate
comprehensive agri. finance policies and set up dedicated divisions/units within banks, well equipped by
trained professional staff, to promote agricultural credit. ‘Further, the scope of agri. financing has been
widened by including Islamic as well as value chain financing aspects in the revised agri. PRs’, he added.

Press Release

State Bank of Pakistan keeps the policy rate unchanged at 10 percent

The Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan met today under the chairmanship of
Governor SBP, Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, at Karachi and decided to maintain the policy rate at 10
percent. The complete text of the decision is as follows:

“Recent gains in confidence in the economy, backed by improvement in key indicators, need to be
nurtured to ensure their sustainability. For instance, the average CPI inflation has remained in single
digits during FY14 and policy vigilance is required for this trend to continue. Economic activity has
improved and further reforms, especially in the energy sector, would help consolidate the momentum.
Similarly, improvement in productivity and competitiveness is a must to continue to build foreign
exchange reserves in the medium term while meeting external obligations.

The year-on-year CPI inflation has remained volatile during FY14. It increased sharply till November 2013
then declined for few months before increasing again to 9.2 percent in April 2014. The average CPI
inflation for July-April, FY14 is 8.7 percent; higher than the year’s target of 8 percent. The main reason
for this volatility is unexpected movements in food prices and changes in administered prices. The core
inflation, however, has remained quite stable at around 8 percent over the past 12 months. Importantly,
from the point of view of monetary policy, it is the outlook of inflation that matters.

The SBP expects average CPI inflation to remain around 8 percent during FY15, barring any exogenous
shock. Basic factors supporting this assessment are: (i) moderate aggregate demand; (ii) deceleration in
broad money growth led by contained government budgetary borrowings from the banking system; (iii)
expectations of low inflationary pressures as indicated by SBP-IBA consumer confidence survey; and (iv)
stable outlook of international commodity prices.

Indicators of current economic activity are looking better as well. Provisional estimates of real GDP show
a growth of 4.1 percent for FY14. Encouragingly, this growth has been led by a 5.8 percent increase in
the industrial sector output. Examination of private credit data also points in the direction of improved
economic activity. For instance, the flow of net credit to private sector was almost two and a half times
more during the first nine months of current fiscal year compared to the corresponding period of last
year. Similarly, the monthly average gross credit disbursements, arguably a better gauge of the nexus
between credit and production, during the same period are about Rs150 billion higher this year.

These trends show that interest rate is only one factor in affecting economic activity. It is the
improvement in sentiments, relatively better availability of energy, and reduction in government
borrowing from the banking system that has encouraged the private sector. The continuation of these
trends, however, would require a sustained effort to ease impediments to growth through
implementation of necessary reforms. In particular, reforms in the energy sector can go a long way in
increasing productivity, easing the fiscal burden, and reducing the import bill.

FY14 was a better year for the Macro-economy: SBP Annual Report

FY14 was a better year for the macro-economy, says the State Bank’s Annual Report on the State of
the Economy for the year 2013-14 released today.

According to the report the most notable developments were the tangible improvement in the
country’s foreign exchange reserves; the unprecedented appreciation of the PKR in early-March; the
reduction in the fiscal deficit; the lower than expected inflation rate; the improvement in private
sector credit; and the relatively contained current account deficit.

‘With the start of a new IMF program, external inflows from other international financial institutions
(IFls) also began after a gap of almost three years,’ the Report observes. This helped stem the gradual
depletion of SBP’s foreign exchange reserves. Moreover, the USS 1.5 billion inflow into Pakistan
Development Fund (PDF) in February/March 2014, contributed in releasing the pent up inflows,
which helped in stabilizing the PKR. The positive sentiments this generated, also instilled a view that
the government was finally gearing up for a growth phase.

The SBP views the fiscal deficit at 5.5 percent of GDP was significantly lower than the FY14 target of
6.5 percent and when compared to trends in the past three years. In our view, said the Report, there
was a concerted effort on the part of the government to contain expenditures and generate
additional revenues, but the one-off factors like the inflow into the PDF and the government delay in
paying off the circular debt in FY14 also played their role. Furthermore, the SBP views the public
sector enterprises (PSEs) continue to be a fiscal burden on the federal government.

According to the Report, although inflation increased marginally in FY14 to 8.6 percent, it was
significantly milder than SBP’s initial projections, due to several factors. First, global oil prices
softened much more than expected. Second, although the weakness of the PKR in the first quarter
had been anticipated, the subsequent appreciation and stabilization after March 2014 meant the
overall weakness of the currency was much lower than projected. Third, the above target
mobilization from the Eurobond and the successful divesture of UBL shares, coupled with a smaller
underlying fiscal gap, sharply reduced government borrowing from the banking system (especially
SBP). Fourth, the increase in electricity and gas tariff were smaller than initially expected. And finally,
the primary source of inflation in Q1-FY14 (perishable food items), had subsided by December 2013.

The Report observed that as part of the stabilization program to reduce the twin deficits (fiscal and
external), the easing monetary policy stance that started in mid-2011, was changed in September
2013. After two consecutive 50 bps increases, SBP held its benchmark rate for the remaining part of
FY14. Although the market’s inflation outlook had eased significantly by early 2014, SBP opted to
pursue a cautious monetary policy driven by concerns about the external sector, and possible
pressure on the PKR.

‘This policy stance appears to be vindicated, as it managed to curb M2 growth to 12.5 percent
(against 15.9 percent growth in FY13) and yet was able to support a significant increase in private
sector credit growth last seen in FY08,’ says the Report. From the supply side, lower government
borrowing from the banking system and healthy growth in deposits, created the space for commercial
banks to lend productively; from the demand side, the optimism after the general elections in May
2013, created a conducive environment to borrow.

State Bank of Pakistan advises banks to extend loans under PMYBL Programme

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held an Orientation Workshop on Prime Minister’s Youth
Business Loans (PMYBL) Programme at SBP, Karachi on September 10, 2014. Mr. Abid Qamar,
Director Infrastructure Housing &SME Finance Department presided over the proceedings of
the workshop which was attended by representatives from SBP, SMEDA, Business Heads and
Product Development Heads of commercial banks.

On the occasion, Mr. Abid Qamar highlighted the importance of the SME sector for spurring
economic growth, employment generation and export earnings. He lamented that despite
significant contribution of SME sector in country’s GDP, the sector is not getting its due share of
financing from the banking system and the share of SME Financing in banks’ total financing has
declined from 17% to 6% during the last 5 years. He said that SBP is aware of the situation and
has undertaken various initiatives for increasing the size of credit by the banks to the SME
sector. “Considering that PM Youth Business Loans Programme can play a very effective role in
promotion of Small Enterprises and thus job creation for the youth in the country, SBP is
providing full support to the Government and the Banks working as Executing Agencies for
successful implementation of the Programme,” he added.

During the workshop, Mr. Irtiza Kazmi, EVP, and Mr. Zubair Mirza, SVP National Bank of
Pakistan briefed the participants about NBP’s PMYBL Product and explained in detail various
operational aspects of their financing under the Programme. Questions raised about PMYBL
Programme were elaborately answered by the SBP and NBP representatives. Mr. Irtiza Kazmi
said that NBP is determined to support the government initiative of providing youth with
Opportunities of financial independence through self-employment under the PMYBL
Programme. Mr. Kazmi commented that the youth of Pakistan though highly enterprising,
generally lack entrepreneurial skills and broadly remain credit constrained. PMYBL Programme
is designed to give them the opportunity to learn and excel in various business segments
thereby bringing prosperity to Pakistan.

Participants from commercial banks took keen interest in the PMYBL Programme and
appreciated the role of SBP in arranging such an informative workshop for them which will
greatly facilitate them in designing their own financing products for extending financing under
the Programme. While concluding the session, Mr. Abid Qamar acknowledged the interest of
banks for their active participation in the workshop and appreciated banks’ resolve for
extending loans under PMYBL purely on merit.

Karachi (August 14): The Governor (acting) State Bank of Pakistan has said the central bank will keep on
playing its role in growth of the country’s economy and _ it is important to follow teachings of our
leaders and keep the national interest supreme in every decision we make.

Addressing the impressive and colourful flag hoisting ceremony to celebrate the 68th Independence Day
of Pakistan here at SBP Headquarters, the Governor (acting) said that live nations celebrate their
independence day with great zeal and enthusiasm. Later, the Governor (acting) hoisted the flag amidst
thunderous clap of the audience. It is pertinent to mention here that as per its glorious tradition, the
State Bank marked the Independence Day with traditional fervour and enthusiasm. The event also
provided a chance to the children of SBP employees to exhibit their love for the motherland as they sang
national songs showering their love to the country.

Terming independence as a great gift by Allah Almighty, the Governor (acting) said, “This day reminds us
of the supreme sacrifices our forefathers had made for creation of this country,” adding,” Our
forefathers had accomplished the arduous task of carving out a country and now it was up to us to look
after this great country. The Governor (acting) added that it is binding upon us to own the spirit behind
creation of Pakistan and leave no stone unturned for its prosperity and progress.

Lauding the spirit behind holding this ceremony, Mr. Ahmad stressed for the need of holding such
events in future as well to let the new generation know difficulties our forefathers confronted during
freedom struggle.

Mr. Ahmad said that State Bank is backbone of country’s economy and its policies, guidelines and
prudential regulations play key role in the economy.” Quaid-e-Azam had declared State Bank the symbol
of our sovereignty on its inauguration on July 1, 1948,” said he adding, ”Keeping State Bank independent
is in country’s interest.”

Earlier Director Inter Bank Security Department Kamran Khan in his welcome address thanked the
Governor (acting) and distinguished guests for sparing time for this ceremony to observe the
Independence Day. He said though the government has issued directives to observe the event
enthusiastically this year, the State Bank always celebrates independence day with fervour and zeal. He
said Pakistan was a great gift of God and it was created due to matchless sacrifices of our forefathers
and stressed the need of protecting it from internal and external threats.

Later, the Governor (acting) inaugurated Independence Day exhibition. The main objective of the
exhibition was to give awareness to younger generation of history and struggle after the independence.
The exhibition consisted of two sections and both sections were arranged in chronological order starting
from 1947 till present day. The exhibition displayed the original newspapers' clippings starting from
1947 to date and portrayed the same time period through historical photographs of political leaders and
major events.

State Bank keeps Policy Rate unchanged at 10.0 percent

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10.0 percent. This was
announced by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Yaseen Anwar while unveiling the Monetary
Policy Statement (MPS) at a press conference at SBP, Karachi. The decision was taken at a meeting of
the Central Board of Directors of SBP held under his chairmanship in Karachi today.

According to the Statement the SBP increased the policy rate by 50 basis points (bps) each in September
and November 2013 mainly on account of two concerns. One was the continued deterioration in the
balance of payments position while the other was worsening of inflation outlook.

The Statement said that the fundamental weakness in the balance of payments position is persistent
contraction in net financial flows since FYO8. Substantial repayments of IMF loans during the last two
and a half years have only increased the pressure.

According to the Statement there is no room for complacency and considerable effort is required to
bring a sustainable improvement in the outlook of external accounts.

The CPI inflation has increased during first half of FY 14. The important point is that the risk of demand-
driven inflation is still rather moderate. It added that international commodity prices have also either
remained stable or declined since the beginning of FY14. This has neutralized to some extent the direct
impact of exchange rate volatility on CPI inflation. Taking into account these factors, SBP has accordingly
revised its inflation projection downward.

The Statement said that the SBP linked the minimum rate of return on average balances held in saving
deposits with the floor of the interest rate corridor. This policy intervention ensures that deposit rates
respond more strongly to policy rate changes.

The Statement said that the quarterly flow of fiscal borrowings from the SBP has remained positive in
both quarters of H1-FY14. This does not bode well for the effectiveness of monetary policy. The SBP
expects that government will keep these borrowings in check in H2-FY14 and lower outstanding stock
gradually as stipulated in the new IMF program.

According to the Statement, a risk to the fiscal position is a possible shortfall in tax revenues, recurrence
of energy sector circular debt, and delays in budgeted foreign inflows. Such deviations could lead to
increase in borrowings from the banking system, further accumulation of domestic debt and higher
inflation.

Although there are some risks to the balance of payments position due to uncertainty surrounding
expected foreign inflows, expected increase in inflation is slightly lower than anticipated earlier. In view
of the above, the Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10.0
percent. ,

State Bank of Pakistan has announced concessional re-finance scheme of Rs 10 billion
for the revival of economic activities and to facilitate the flow of fresh credit in the flood
affected areas as reported by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Under the scheme, a mark-up of 8% per annum will be charged from the farmers and
Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of affected areas by the banks against their

financing for production/ working capital loans/advances.

Further, SBP in a separate Circular has advised commercial & microfinance banks and
DFls to reschedule/ restructure agriculture, SMEs and micro loans/advances of the
affected borrowers. For all such rescheduled/restructured loans and advances,
banks/DFlIs/MFBs may defer loan provisioning up to September 30, 2015. The
relaxation is available for loans and advances which have become non-performing since
September 1, 2014 in the affected areas.

According to the provisional estimates of NDMA as of October 15, 2014 the recent flood
in the country has caused damages to the rural infrastructure and standing crops
affecting around 2.5 million persons of 4,065 villages. It may be recalled that 45 districts

covering farming area of around 2.4 million acres is flood affected.

The relief package announced by the State Bank will not only facilitate the existing
borrowers in terms of rescheduling/restructuring of their non-performing loans but will

agriculture and business activities through borrowing at nominal mark-up of 8% per

annum from the banks.

SBP revises Prudential Requlations for agriculture financing

With a view to enhance access of formal financing to the farming community and to bring
regulatory framework for farmers’ financing in line with the changing business environment,
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued revised Prudential Regulations (PRs) for Agriculture
Financing.

The revised instructions call upon banks to develop robust and market-oriented policies and
practices to promote enhanced flow of credit to the agriculture sector without compromising
financial stability and banks’ risk management.

The revised regulations, among other areas, make it mandatory for banks to formulate
comprehensive agri. financing policies covering broad areas of strategic importance including
loan administration, disbursement & monitoring mechanisms, set-up and maintenance of
dedicated agri. finance departments equipped with qualified agri. financing experts and
delegation of powers relating to loan approval or sanction at appropriate level. Further, to
strengthen credit discipline and prudent lending practices by minimizing information
asymmetries, CIB report for all agri. loans has been mandatory. To facilitate farming community
in repayment of crop production loans under Revolving Credit Scheme on the basis of their
cropping cycle, banks are now required to segregate the repayment in two stages of at least
50% of the utilized credit during the year after harvest of each rabi and kharif crop.

PRs also cover Islamic Agriculture financing which will encourage banks to develop and launch
products to meet the financing needs of the farming community under Shariah Compliant
modes.

Revisions in these regulations have been made in consultations with stakeholders and
encompass prudent practices for banks financing various activities within agri. value chain and
come into force with immediate effect.

Farmers reap benefit as banks’ credit disbursement grows

Pakistan’s farmers are benefiting as banks’ agriculture credit disbursement nears the annual target. During first
eleven months of the current fiscal year i.e. July - May 2014, banks disbursed Rs 334.7 billion or 88.0% of the
annual target of Rs 380.0 billion, with some of the banks already surpassing their annual targets.

It may be recalled here that during recent meeting with banks, Syed Samar Hasnain, Executive Director, State
Bank of Pakistan, re-emphasized the need to boost up credit disbursement to farming community and urged
banks to ensure achievement of annual agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs. 380 billion for 2013-14.

Banks’ disbursement is 13.6% higher than Rs 294.5 billion during the corresponding period last year. The
outstanding portfolio of agricultural loans has increased by Rs 30.3 billion (12.3%) i.e. from Rs 246.7 billion
to Rs 277.0 billion at end May, 2014 as compared to same period last year.

Five major commercial banks as a group disbursed agri. loans of Rs 169.4 billion or 90.1% of its annual target
which is higher by 7.9% from Rs 157.0 billion during the corresponding period last year. Amongst the five
major banks HBL, MCB, UBL, NBP and ABL achieved respectively 92.5%, 92.4%, 91.9%, 91.7% and 78.9%
of their individual annual targets.

Amongst specialized banks, ZTBL achieved 93.1% of its target by disbursing Rs 64.7 billion against its annual
target of Rs 69.5 billion while PPCBL achieved 66.2% of its target of Rs 10.0 billion by disbursing Rs 6.6
billion during the period under review.

Fourteen domestic private banks collectively achieved 81.6% of their annual targets. Under domestic private
bank’s category, the Standard Chartered Bank has already surpassed its annual target while Bank Al Habib
achieved 96.6% of its annual target, Sindh Bank achieved 96.2%, Bank of Punjab 93.2%, Bank Alfalah 89.5%,

State Bank Quells Rumors and Reiterates that the Banking System of Pakistan is Stable

 

Since the imposition of moratorium on KASB Bank Ltd, rumors are being spread that the financial
condition of some banks is weak and they may also face supervisory action. These are also being
accompanied with misleading information attributed to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The SBP has taken
strong notice of such misinformation and it is clarified that no such information has been circulated
through media nor it has been placed on SBP’s website. The public need not to pay attention to such

rumors, which are trying to undermine the overall stability and performance of the banking system.

The SBP reassures the general public that country’s banking sector is stable and strong. To strengthen
the banking system, the SBP had set certain milestones for enhancing banks’ capital base, which are
being achieved satisfactorily. SBP is regularly engaged with banks for capital improvement.
Consequently, equity base of the banking system has increased by 11 percent to above PKR 1,000 billion
in September, 2014 from PKR 900 billion in September 2013.

It is reiterated that the banking sector’s performance has been quite impressive. As already reported in
the quarterly banking system statistics for end September 2014, the banks in Pakistan earned historical
profit before tax of PKR 176 billion for first 9 months of the year 2014, while its solvency remains strong
with Capital Adequacy Ratio(CAR) of 15.5 percent. The banking sector is the second largest sector in
terms of market capitalization and dividend payouts among the companies listed on the stock
exchanges. The capital position of the banking system will further strengthen due to expected fresh

capital inflows and improving profitability.

The continuous improvement in capital base of banks clearly contradicts the rumors currently circulating
in the media. The SBP assure the public that its policies are directed towards safeguarding the interest of
depositors and stability of the banking system. Regulatory action like the one taken in respect of KASB
Bank only aims at resolving the problems faced by the institution thus protecting depositors’ interest.
State Bank of Pakistan reiterates its commitment to ensure the stability of the banking system of the

country.

GDP grows by 5 percent: SBP’s Quarterly Report

The State Bank of Pakistan released its First Quarterly Report for FY14 on the State of Economy,
today. The report says that since macroeconomic indicators were favorable at the start of the year, the
increase in real GDP growth in FY14 was discernible. Estimates for growth exceeded expectations:
GDP grew by 5.0 percent during Q1-FY14, compared to only 2.9 percent in Q1-FY13, and a target of
4.4 percent for the full year. Industry and services were the major drivers of growth, as agriculture
performed below target.

As the industrial sector revived, import pressures reappeared, especially for capital goods and raw
materials. The import of petroleum, machinery, and metal, was particularly strong, which increased
the trade deficit by US$ 0.6 billion during Q1-FY14 over Q1-FY13. Additional stress on the current
account came from delayed inflows of coalition support fund (CSF) in Q1-FY14 As a result, the
current account posted a deficit of US$ 1.2 billion in Q1-FY14, against a surplus of US$ 0.4 billion in
Q1-FY13. Although worker remittances posted an impressive 9.1 percent growth, this was not
enough to cover the FX gap in other heads.

The report said that repayments on external debt continued to exceed fresh disbursements while
foreign investments remained shy. This caused a strain on the country’s FX reserves, which posted a
decline of US$ 1.2 billion during the quarter. As a result, the PKR depreciated by 6.0 percent against
the US Dollar during Q1-FY14, compared to only 0.3 percent in the first quarter of the previous year.

The report pointed out that headline CPI inflation increased to 8.1 percent in Q1-FY14, compared to
only 5.6 percent in the preceding quarter. SBP increased its policy rate by 50 bps to 9.5 percent in the
monetary policy decision announced in September 2013 to rein in the second-round effect of food
inflation, curb inflation expectations and to counter market sentiments following the volatile PKR.

According to the report, government borrowing from the central bank was more pronounced, as
commercial banks did not participate actively in T-bill auctions held during the quarter. As a result,
the government could not meet the limit of zero quarterly borrowing from SBP, though its borrowings
were well below the limit agreed with the IMF.

The fiscal deficit fell to 1.1 percent of GDP in Q1-FY14, from 1.2 percent in the corresponding
quarter last year. This improvement occurred on both the revenue and expenditure sides. On the
revenue side, it was the increase in tax rates and not the base which is responsible for higher
collection during the quarter. Non-tax collections were also high due to certain one-off revenues. On
the expenditure side, a major positive was the reduction in interest payments, following the interest
rate cuts in FY13.

The report said that public debt posted a record increase of Rs 1.0 trillion during the quarter. This
increase, however, does not represent the fiscal imbalances alone, which recorded only a modest
increase. Instead, this increase can primarily be traced to large revaluation losses associated with the

15t November 2014

SBP reduces the policy rate by 50 bps

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 bps to 9.5 percent. The
decision was taken by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting held under the
chairmanship of Governor Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra in Karachi today.

The complete text of the decision is as follows:

Limited impact of floods and a favorable trend in global commodity prices are the major
highlights of the post-September monetary policy decision. Indeed, CPI inflation (YoY) in
October 2014 has come down sharply to 5.8 percent. This decline is explained by: smooth food
supplies, which contained the price of perishable items; falling administered prices, which
incorporate the fall in international commodity prices, especially oil; low inflation expectations,
as witnessed by IBA-SBP consumer confidence surveys; and a significant base effect. These
developments bode well for the outlook of other macroeconomic variables in general.

Given its recent downward trend, the likelihood for inflation to end the current fiscal year on a
lower plateau is high. But, there are risks. First, downward trend over the medium to long term
remains to be seen because it is based on volatile prices of “ perishable items” and “oil”. Second,
other risks identified in the previous statement, such as cut in subsidy to electricity and levying
of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess, still hold and if materialized can alter the inflation
outlook on a higher side. Third, underlying inflationary pressures on core inflation remain.

The current low oil price could salvage some of the lost growth momentum. Broadly, however,
growth in Large-scale manufacturing would remain constrained due to energy bottlenecks.
Thus the main thrust to the growth momentum would come from agriculture outcomes in the
remaining months of FY15. Barring the limited flood-related damage to some kharif crops,
agriculture output is expected to perform better than the previous year especially now when
incentive for Rabbi season crops has been announced; such as, the recent increase of Rs100 in
wheat support price.

Government has shown a significant progress in curtailing budgetary imbalances. It seems on
course to achieve further fiscal consolidation, given its current management of expenditures
and borrowing pattern. This has positive implications for the monetary management of the SBP
and more importantly, in the coming months, it would have a favorable impact on the private
sector credit cycle. However, to achieve fiscal consolidation in the long run, structural reforms
to broaden the tax base remain imperative.

SBP sets Agriculture Credit Disbursement target of Rs 500 billion for 2014-15

 

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has set Agriculture Credit Disbursement Target of Rs 500 billion for
2014-15 to facilitate growth in agricultural production. This was announced in the annual meeting of
the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held at SBP, Lahore on 12"" July 2014. The
Finance Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Ishaque Dar graced the occasion after the meeting to encourage all
stake holders and the banking community for their support to agricultural sector.

Addressing the meeting, Governor SBP said the Finance Minister and the government has a keen
interest and high commitment to upgrade this vital sector of the economy, which is essential for
achieving the broader national objectives of rapid economic growth and alleviation of poverty.

Highlighting the role of agriculture in Pakistan, he said that agriculture sector is an essential
component accounting for around 20 percent of GDP and employs nearly half of the labor force. The
sector directly supports three-quarters of the population and contributes a large share of foreign
exchange earnings to the country. The Governor also emphasized that to increase agriculture
production and foster its growth, we need to increase productivity through optimum utilization of
resources and use of advanced farming techniques. The sector has a lot of potential which can be
better tapped by making available the required financial resources as and when needed.

Referring to SBP’s initiatives for improving access to finance to the farming community, the
Governor told that as per provisional figures, around Rs 389 billion have been disbursed by the end
of FY 2013-14 (by 30th June 2014), thus surpassing the revised target of Rs 380 billion.

Mr. Wathra said that SBP has long been making efforts to enhance the flow of credit to agriculture;
resultantly, the agricultural disbursements registered steady growth and rose to Rs 333 billion in FY
2012-13 from Rs 169 billion in FY 2006-07 recording an annual growth of over 10 percent. The
revised target for 2013-14 was set at Rs. 380 billion which was rather challenging for both SBP and
banks which was however not only met but superseded.

Referring to the indicative target for 2014-15 of Rs 500 billion assigned by the Government, he
expressed that “we, as a banking community, gladly accept it as a challenge and are fully committed
to accomplish this ambitious target”. He further elaborated that while SBP has developed a strategy
to achieve this target, however, this will require high level of commitment from banks’ Board of
Directors and their top management.

The Governor requested the national and provincial government representatives to give their
assurance and commitment to provide all kinds of support to the banking industry, especially
agriculture lending banks for smooth operations. He also urged upon banks that this is a high time to
play a meaningful role in the achievement of national goals of growth and development by
channeling adequate financial resources to the agriculture sector. The Governor also pointed out
that the share of banks’ credit to agriculture is around 5.7% of their total advances and the total
outreach is to just over 2.15 million borrowers as against 8.3 million farm households in the country.
This indicates ample room for enhancement of agriculture portfolio by the banks. Further, according
to estimates, only 35 to 40 percent credit requirement of agricultural sector is being met by the
formal banking system while the remaining is fulfilled through non-institutional credit sources.

BRANCHLESS BANKING SHOWS ROBUST GROWTH

Branchless banking (BB) transactions showed a robust growth of 29% during the quarter July —
September, 2013 to reach Rs 224 billion, whilst BB accounts climbed up by 12% leading to 2.96 million
BB accounts operating in the country.

According to State Bank of Pakistan’s latest Branchless Banking Newsletter, 51.9 million BB
transactions were recorded during Jul-Sep, 2013, which is 16% higher than that in the previous quarter.
The growth demonstrated stems from small-value transactions averaging Rs.4,315 largely carried out by
unbanked segment of population for domestic remittances, social welfare payments such as BISP,
Watan Card etc, pension payments, and utility bill payments. Owing to SBP’s supportive policy
environment for branchless banking, these BB services are being offered at alternative delivery channels
in the form of agent network, mobile phones, ATMs, and PoS.

The agent network continued to rapidly expand and has reached 110,214 in number. This fast
expansion has also been fueled by the trend of using shared agents by the providers.

According to the newsletter, over the counter (OTC) transactions were 41.87 million worth
Rs.116.8 billion, demonstrating growth of 12% in volume, and 24% in value, during the quarter.
Meanwhile, 7.2 million m-wallet transactions, valuing Rs 13.6 billion were performed, signifying 32%
growth in volume and 44% in value during the quarter. Even though OTC transactions, with a share of
81% in overall number of BB transactions dominated over m-wallet transactions which seized a share of
14%, if compared to last quarter a slight pickup of 2% share in m-wallets transactions has been
observed.

The BB market, currently consisting of eight players, is gradually becoming competitive and
innovative. According to the newsletter, international consultants from World Bank testified in a
workshop held at SBP in December 2013 that SBP’s policy framework for BB and financial inclusion is in
sync with the best approach for optimally managing linkages between financial inclusion and central
banks’ traditionally core objectives of financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection.

Mobile Money is a viable channel for masses to access Financial services:
Wathra

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has said that mobile money
landscape has proved a viable channel for the un-served and underserved masses to access
financial services with minimum know-your-customers (K YC) requirements. He expressed these
views while addressing SBP-CGAP-DFID Workshop on Inclusion-Effective Interoperability
held today at a local hotel in Karachi.

Wathra encouraged the industry to develop interoperability solution in the market to catalyze the
take up of mobile wallets, increase choices for the customers, and expand the business of banks.

Governor SBP said that our objectives for financial inclusion are not only to reach out to poor
people, but also to contribute to banking stability and economic development. ‘In SBP’s vision,
‘Payment System’ and ‘Financial Inclusion’ are mutually-reinforcing, and their linkages are
expected to deepen further in future, he said, adding, ‘In line with this vision, digital financial
inclusion is going to be the cornerstone of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) that
is currently in the stage of formulation.’

Wathra stated that Pakistan mobile phone subscribers are almost 140 million. In contrast, the
banking accounts are only 37 million whereas number of borrowers is as low as 6 million. These
statistics indicate that there exist a large “financially-excluded” market, facing difficulties in
buying goods and services, paying utility bills, borrowing and saving, or investing in their future.
Registering this un-served market through mobile wallets should be our key objective.

It is encouraging to see that the branchless banking sector is proving to be a driving force to
penetrate into the unbanked geographies with an agent network of 168,000 agents, 4.2 million m-
wallets and Rs. 1,063 Billion worth of transactions for the last year. Despite the rapid growth, the
BB industry has however not been able to register mobile wallets massively in comparison to the
potential market.

A robust environment of interoperability in branchless banking shall benefit all participants in
the Payments ecosystem. End users, including consumers, merchants, governments, and other
types of enterprises would find it easier to make and accept payments. Providers to these end
users, including banks, networks and other service providers shall capitalize on each other’s
strengths in interoperable systems that they may not be able to achieve with closed loop (or non-
interoperable) systems.

Q2 CY14: Mobile Wallets reach 4.2 million

The number of mobile wallets has reached to 4.2 million by the end of the quarter April- June
2014, registering an increase of 11%. The mobile wallets are banking accounts which are being
opened largely by the previously unbanked population at their nearby shops which are working as
branchless banking agents.

Overall, number of Branchless banking (BB) transactions grew to 71.1 million valuing Rs 326.1 billion
during the quarter, 4% higher in volume and 17% higher in value in comparison to the previous quarter.
Average size of transaction stood at only Rs 4,581, according to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s latest
Branchless Banking Newsletter.

The volume and average size of BB transactions is a key indicator measuring access to finance by the
unbanked population in the country. The continuous growth of BB transactions reflects interest and
confidence of common man in this innovative banking service. Currently, eight BB players with country-
wide presence of easy-to-access service delivery channels are offering an array of services including bill
payments, money transfers, Government-to-persons (G2P) payments, loan repayments, and mobile top
ups.

The combined agent network of BB players has increased to 168,615 agents, registering 14% growth
over the last quarter. While recent growth in agent network is owed to agent-sharing arrangements
among the players, the number of distinct agents is estimated to be around 80,000.

According to the newsletter, G2P payments worth Rs 16.9 billion were disbursed via BB channels to 5.3
million beneficiaries during April- June 2014 quarter, higher than Rs 15.32 billion disbursed to 4.6 million
beneficiaries in the last quarter.

As a result of various initiatives taken by State Bank of Pakistan, branchless banking has been reaching
out to all geographic and economic segments of the country. SBP considers that branchless banking
would grow further and gradually become a significant part of overall retail banking landscape in
Pakistan.

The newsletter covers BB industry events, local and international news, and industry expert interview.
Importantly, the newsletter highlights the progress of an important SBP’s initiative to engage World Bank
for drafting a first-ever National Financial Inclusion Strategy for Pakistan.

State Bank of Pakistan Issued “Code of Conduct” For Treasuries of Banks, DFls and PDs

 

State Bank of Pakistan today has issued “Code of Conduct” for the treasuries of Banks, DFls and
PDs. The size of Pakistan’s Interbank Market, its diversity and complexity have grown over the
years. Therefore, the need of adopting highest ethical conduct and uniform practices has

become essential for smooth functioning of the market.

This ‘Code of Conduct’ has an important role to play in promoting ethical behavior and
standards of conduct; affirming the use of sound dealing practices and procedures; supporting
robust and efficient front and back office operations; and mitigating risks from the point of
execution to settlement. The application of this ‘Code of Conduct’ is expected to address

weaknesses in business practices with a view to foster stronger market resilience.

The objective of introducing this ‘Code of Conduct’ is to foster high standard of business
conduct, adopt good market practices and ensure equitable and healthy relationships among
market participants. The recommendations contained in the recognized codes like “ACI Model
Code of Conduct” and “Singapore Guide to Conduct & Market Practices for Treasury Activities”
were considered in compiling this ‘Code of Conduct’. Further, stakeholders in the Inter-bank
market have also been consulted through the forum of Financial Markets Association of

Pakistan (FMAP).

All Banks, DFls and PDs have been advised to implement this Code of Conduct in their treasuries
and ensure its meticulous compliance which will also be checked by the SBP inspection teams
during on-site inspections. Further, Risk and Compliance Department of the each Bank/DFI/PD,
has been advised to submit a quarterly report to their senior management regarding
compliance to this ‘Code of Conduct’, which should be discussed and documented along with all

exceptions and breaches.

SBP hosted SAARCFINANCE Seminar on Risk Management Framework in Banks

 

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Acting Governor, State Bank of Pakistan highlighted the significance
of robust risk management framework in banks for healthy banking system and economic growth.

While addressing the participants of the SAARCFINANCE seminar on “risk management framework in
banks” held at NIBAF, Islamabad, Mr. Wathra said that banks’ risk management frameworks should
strive to cover the full spectrum of risks and should be tailored as per their specific needs and
circumstances. Nevertheless, he elaborated on the main elements of a risk management framework
which included active role of the Board of Directors of Banks and senior management, establishment
of adequate policies, procedures, limits and controls, effective MIS and institutionalization of a risk
management function.

He also highlighted the key lessons learnt from the global financial crisis due to weaknesses in the
risk management practices. He stressed the need for active involvement of the board of directors
elevated role of the Chief Risk Officers (CRO) in the business planning and strategy, alignment of
compensation with the risk-adjusted performance, institutionalization of risk culture, and
management of risk at enterprise level.

He informed that SBP has established a comprehensive and well balanced regulatory and
supervisory framework. In this regard, he mentioned various guidelines and instructions issued by
SBP for effective risk management in banks. He further added that a major on-going regulatory
development is the implementation of Basel III in Pakistan from December 2013. Further, Pakistan
banking industry has a strong capital base as reflected by a capital adequacy ratio of 16 percent.

In the end, he said that expanding business arenas, globalization of financial activities, emergence of
new financial products and increased level of competition have opened up opportunities but also
increased the potential risks from such developments. Therefore, such regional forums are very
helpful in facilitating knowledge exchange and ongoing collaboration for region specific issues which
may pose potential risks for each of our banking sectors.

Earlier, Mr. Amir Aziz, MD, NIBAF welcomed the distinguished guests and presented the main concept
of the seminar.

State Bank, IBA launch

Consumer Confidence Survey Website

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Yaseen Anwar has said that information provided by consumer
confidence survey brings him in touch with the ground realities of Pakistan. He was speaking at the
occasion of the official launch of the IBA-SBP consumer confidence survey website.

Introducing the audience to the IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey, he said that in January 2012,
together with Dr. Ishrat “we inaugurated the Centre for Survey Research (CSR), housed on the 2""
floor of SBP LRC building. In this centre, students and teachers from IBA and SBP officers have
been meeting every other month to collect data on households’ views about various economic
propositions.”

Mr. Anwar said that consumer confidence and inflation expectations reflect the confidence of the
households in the economy. These “expectations regarding inflation, interest rate, stock prices, and
employment are important for policy formulation, which explains why many developed and
developing countries are using consumer surveys for policymaking and research purposes.”

He added that results from these surveys help us study not only the expectations of consumers but also
their reaction to different economic and policy shocks. The information gathered from this exercise is
expected to help in the process of designing a forward-looking monetary policy in the country.

Referring to the moving stories of households suffering from gas shortage and loadshedding, Mr.
Anwar said that the “project provides me an opportunity to get a glimpse into the thought process of
Pakistani households as well as their livelihood.”

According to Mr. Anwar, the impact of the project is indeed much wider in scope than keeping the
policymaker informed about the ground realities of the economy. “We have been increasingly using
the concepts of consumer sentiments and inflation expectations in our flagship publications of annual
and quarterly reports as well as most recently in our Monetary Policy Statements,” he added.

He informed the audience that twelve waves of the survey had been completed. “In each wave, we
surveyed in excess of 1800 households. The sample of households is spread all over Pakistan and
households are chosen randomly from the PTCL directory. Furthermore, the sample is stratified on the
basis of population.”

Mr. Anwar said that the project had been developed in-house but “we have benefitted from our
colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, CIMS at University of Surrey and Yale
University in the form of theoretical background, development and implementation.”

Wathra appreciates banks’ interest in PM Youth Business Loans Programme

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra while appreciating the banks’
desire to voluntarily participate in Prime Minister’s Youth Business Loans (PMYBL) programme has said
that banks’ participation in the programme can play a very effective role in promotion of Small and

Medium Enterprises (SME) financing and thus job creation for the youth in the country.

It is pertinent to mention that Youth Business Loan Programme was launched by the Prime
Minister in December 2013 and currently it is being implemented through National Bank of Pakistan and
First Women Bank Limited. The other banks have now voluntarily demonstrated their pledge to support
the economic initiatives in empowering the youth in either setting up new businesses or strengthening

existing businesses.

A cluster of banks (excluding NBP/FWBL) has indicated that the banks can extend loans under
the PMYBL programme upto Rs. 20 billion during fiscal year 2014-15. Similar targets will be announced
in subsequent years. In order to effectively implement this programme, the banks are likely to specialize
in one or more specific SME market segments and will train and allocate capable and dedicated personnel

to deliver.

It is worth mentioning here that SBP prudential regulations for SME financing, issued last year,
have facilitated the banks to increase outreach of their financial services to small entities with ease. SMEs
mostly tend to be labour-intensive and help in creating more jobs with relatively low levels of investment.
Thus promoting activities of this sector through extension of credit can help in reducing unemployment in

the country more effectively.

Mr. Wathra while acknowledging and appreciating banks’ resolve for extending loans under

PMYBL purely on merit, hoped that the loans provided under the programme will have significant effect

Financial exclusion hindering people in availing opportunities:

Acting Governor SBP

Acting Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, has said that financial
exclusion is hindering our fellow citizens in availing economic and business opportunities. Speaking
at the Bank Alfalah Mobile Commerce Conference in Karachi today, he said that an estimated 2.5

billion adult people worldwide did not have access to formal financial services.

He said that Pakistan’s branch network of almost 12,700 was insufficient to serve the millions of
unbanked masses. “Banks operating in Pakistan are hosting only 35 million customer accounts
including 3.5 million accounts opened by branchless banking providers. Despite phenomenal spread
of banking business in Pakistan, we have a long way to go to achieve digital financial inclusion the

in country.”

Mr. Wathra further said that given the complexities and challenges of limited financial access in the
country, SBP had adopted a multi-pronged and long-term strategy to address financial exclusion

through structured policy & regulatory actions, and market-development interventions.

He pointed out that Pakistan was amongst the pioneers of mobile/branchless banking in the
developing world. “This could not have been possible without an effective and enabling regulatory
regime, dynamic, innovative and always eager banking and telecom industry in the country,” he
added.

He added that SBP was focusing its energies to identify gaps and bring solutions to address those
gaps. He told the audience that SBP had formed the National Branchless Banking Consultative
Group with representation from branchless banking industry players including banks, mobile
operators, and technology service providers. “This group is actively working on different protocols
including agent code of conduct, agent sharing models, interoperability schemes and consumer

State Bank introduces incentives for SME Borrowers under
Export Finance Scheme

Recognizing the economic significance of Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs), State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) in line with its regulatory policy framework for development of the sector has introduced some
special incentives for both banks and SME exporters to enhance their share under Export Finance Scheme
(EFS). These incentives will enable SME borrowers to fulfill their financing needs and ultimately contribute
to exports growth of the country.

Effective March 4, 2014 Banks’ spread in EFS mark-up rate has been increased from 1% to 2% for
SME borrowers, according to a circular issued by SBP today. Banks can charge spread of 2% (currently
1%) under the scheme against lending to SMEs without changing prevailing end user rate. SBP refinance
rate will be adjusted accordingly. Any bank claiming refinance facility against financing provided to SMEs
will be required to give a certificate on a prescribed specimen.

Under existing performance based mark-up rebate system of EFS Part-II, exporters can avail mark-
up rate rebate ranging from 0.5 — 1.5 percentage points depending on the level of export performance
achieved. For SMEs the incentives of mark-up rebate have been increased by 0.5 percentage point for each
category of existing export performance level. This performance based mark-up rate rebate will be allowed
to high performers of SME borrowers against achievement of high export performance during FY 2013-14
and onward.

It has been decided that utilization of the available limit for SMEs by banks will also be taken into
account while sanctioning their annual revolving limits under EFS. Banks will be required to allocate at
least 10% of their limit for SMEs out of their total limit. Accordingly banks can extend financing to
corporate exporters up to a maximum of 90% of their annual limit. However, new limits of banks will be
adjusted in a way that existing share of corporate borrowers is not disturbed due to meeting the minimum
SME share i.e. 10%. A reasonable transition period is given to the banks to adopt this mechanism for limit
allocation and adjust their corporate clients share accordingly. SBP BSC offices will start implementing this
new mechanism from 1st July, 2015. While extending finance, banks should continue to follow the
regulations regarding maximum exposure against a single SME prescribed under Prudential Regulations for
SMEs.

State Bank and PBA launch Clean Chundrigar Road drive

State Bank of Pakistan and Pakistan Banks’ Association has joined hands in a drive to clean up I.
I. Chundrigar Road of wall chalking, garbage and other waste. On the initiative of Acting Governor SBP
Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Sunday March 30 was celebrated as “Clean Chundrigar Road — 2014” day.
A ribbon cutting ceremony was held at State Bank of Pakistan. Governor Sindh Dr. Ishrat-ul-Ebaad Khan
was the chief guest. It marks the beginning of a year-long campaign to clean I. I. Chundrigar Road.

The 2.5 km road is divided into eight sections allocated to eight different banks: Bank Alfalah
limited, National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Limited, Bank Al Habib, Habib Bank Limited,
MCB Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited and JS Bank Limited will participate in the drive.

Speaking on the occasion Governor of Sindh Dr. Ishrat ul Ebad Khan said that every citizen of Pakistan
needs a clean area to work and live in.

“Throwing garbage in the streets, roads or parks has become a common practice in our society. In public
places dustbins are seldom found. Even if dustbins are installed, people do not use them properly.”

He urged all Karachiites to embrace the cleanliness and wall chalking day and take some positive steps
towards making Karachi the city of our dreams.

Acting Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra said that no society could afford to ignore the
significance of cleanliness and hygiene. He reminded the audience that earlier in a similar project in 2007,
funds were supplied for a similar project for construction and refurbishing I. I. Chundrigar Road. SBP and
other stakeholders had contributed the huge amount of Rs 230 million for the project. But after the
completion of the project, Municipal Administration did not look after its cleanliness and maintenance.

“Tt is the corporate social responsibility of the State Bank of Pakistan and commercial banks to remain
committed to ensuring a positive impact of our activities on the environment. We must, at the individual
and collective level, adopt a pro-active approach instead of waiting for someone to come along and do it
for us.”

He urged all the stakeholders to come forward and join hands to purge the road of garbage and take active
part in the campaign.

The campaign was formally launched with the joint ribbon cutting ceremony by the Governor Sindh and
acting Governor SBP.

Deputy Governors SBP, senior officers of SBP along with their families, Commissioner Karachi, City

State Bank denies any laxity in verifying Election 2013 candidates’ data

Karachi (Sep 25): State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has strongly rejected the report of 2013
Election Observers that SBP did not timely provide candidates’ data to the Election Commission
of Pakistan (ECP) for scrutiny purpose.

In a statement issued to the media, the SBP Chief Spokesman clarified that SBP had provided
complete information as agreed with the ECP and there was no deficiency or delay in supplying
the required information to ECP. “A mutually agreed reporting format mechanism was
developed between SBP and ECP for scrutinizing the nomination papers of contesting
candidates for the election 2013. The mechanism was finalized at the highest level in meetings
with the ECP which were also attended by the Governor SBP” the spokesman said.

Giving details of the agreed arrangements, the spokesman said that Returning Officers (ROs)
were required to upload the particulars of candidates contesting election on the web portal of
ECP for onward submission to the State Bank. In response, State Bank had to provide the
required information about the defaults of contesting candidates within 24 hours. ‘SBP started
receiving requests from ECP through online system from March 26, 2013 and completed the
process on April 7, 2013 on daily basis, and no instance of any delay was reported whatsoever,’
the spokesman maintained.

The spokesman elaborated that the State Bank had made special arrangements whereby
officials were deputed exclusively for the purpose and particulars of 24,286 candidates and their
110,972 family members were searched in e-CIB database and responses were uploaded
without delay. The spokesman further explained that “SBP had also developed an on-line
information portal for the purpose of smooth and efficient verification of the data. In this regard,
ECP was requested by the SBP through a letter dated March 29, 2013 to advise all the
Returning Officers to seek the verification of loan defaults as per agreed arrangements, instead
of approaching State Bank directly.”

Shedding light on SBP’s extraordinary role, the spokesman elucidated that “Further, a Director-
level official of State Bank was deputed at ECP during the entire period for coordination and on-
spot resolution of any related matters. Also, a senior SBP official well-versed with e-CIB
assisted the Lahore High Court in disposal of appeals of the candidates. It is important to
mention that SBP facilitated the opening of bank branches on weekly holidays for settlement of
any outstanding dues from the contesting candidates. Thus, the SBP carried out this task day
and night in national interest.”

He recalled that the role of SBP was also lauded publicly by the Chief Election Commissioner at
several occasions and no lack of cooperation was ever reported by the ECP or media.

SBP enhances per acre limits for farmers’ financing

With a view to align the cost of production of various farming activities with inflationary
pressures and current market practices, the State Bank of Pakistan has revised the Report on
Indicative Credit Limits & List of Eligible Items for Agri Financing. The production financing limits
have been revised for major and minor crops, orchards and forestry.

Under major corps, financing limits per acre for rice, wheat, cotton and sugarcane have been
increased to Rs 34,000, Rs 29,000, Rs 39,000 and Rs 53,000 respectively from existing limits of
Rs 19,000, Rs 16,000, Rs 21,000 and Rs 30,000 fixed in 2008.

The report provides a yardstick for banks to assess the credit needs of different groups of
farmers’ vis-a-vis their activities. Banks extensively use the Report for reporting financing
statistics to SBP as per the list of eligible items. The provincial planning departments use the
methodology of the Report to determine the farm and non-farm sector financing and credit
requirements.

The revised Report includes the parameters for segmentation of borrowers based on land
holdings and average requirements of seed, fertilizers and pesticides have also been embedded
in the revised Report to facilitate provincial planning departments in computing financial and
credit requirements of respective provinces for farm sector activities. An exhaustive list of
activities and purposes segregated for farm and non-farm sector has also been annexed to the
Report.

The revised limits for per acre cost of production are indicative and banks can adjust these
based on the actual credit requirements of farmers, market conditions, and prevailing prices of
farm inputs at respective place while sanctioning the loan.

The Report has been revised in consultation with Pakistan Agriculture Research Council,
provincial government including AJK, agricultural universities, agri. lending banks and farmers’
representatives. The revised report and enhanced indicative per acre credit limits are expected
to facilitate farmers in getting adequate loans for growing their farms and forestry besides
facilitating banks and provincial governments to estimate actual credit requirements of the
farmers.

Mortgage Refinance Company will catalyze promotion and growth of Housing
Finance in Pakistan; says Saeed Ahmed, Deputy Governor, State Bank

“Apart from other limiting legal and operational obstacles, non-availability of long term liquidity
does not allow requisite growth in housing finance in Pakistan”. Mr. Saeed Ahmed, Deputy
Governor said while chairing first meeting of the Steering Committee of Mortgage Refinance
Company (MRC) held on October 13, 2014 at State Bank of Pakistan.

The Meeting was also attended by other members of the Committee including executives of
MRC’s equity holder banks/DFls, representative from Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Housing &
Works, and an industry specialist from IFC. The Committee would steer the process of
incorporation of MRC expeditiously in a planned manner. Further, the Steering Committee will
also be responsible to discuss pre- and post- incorporation formalities for the MRC.

In his opening remarks, Mr. Saeed Ahmad highlighted the fact that Pakistan is far behind in
terms of mortgage finance to GDP ratio even within the region. He emphasized on need of
development of housing sector because of its forward and backward linkages with more than 40
allied industries. He further mentioned that realizing its significance, the Federal government
and State Bank of Pakistan are taking various steps for promotion and development of housing
finance.

While other key issues including foreclosure laws, land record system, stamp duties etc are
being handled separately by the concerned quarters, formation of MRC under public-private-
partnership model, would help in provision of long term funding to primary mortgage market and
development of secondary market in Pakistan by adopting appropriate refinancing models.
Further, the Chair also briefed that significant progress has been made during this year as
feasibility report of MRC has been revalidated by independent international consultants and firm
equity commitments have been secured from commercial banks/DFls and the Government of
Pakistan. Mr. Saeed Ahmad clarified that MRC will work on with-recourse model which will
ensure that its financial health is not affected in case of default by mortgage borrowers as banks
would be required to replace bad mortgages with the good ones. MRC will also help in
development of capital markets by issuance of corporate bonds/TFCs/Sukuks.

Deputy Governor set end December 2014 as the deadline to incorporate MRC with SECP.

Islamic finance all set to become alternative

to conventional banking: Deputy Governor SBP

Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Saeed Ahmad has said that Islamic finance is all set
to become a better alternative to the conventional banking. He was speaking today in Karachi on the
occasion of completion of ten successful years of ‘Raast Islamic Banking’ programme of Bank of Khyber.

Congratulating Bank of Khyber Management, Board of Directors, and ‘Raast Islamic Banking’ team, Mr.
Saeed Ahmad hoped that with continued demand on an accelerated basis for the Islamic banking in the
country, Bank of Khyber would participate in the sector and reap benefits for all stakeholders including
its shareholders.

According to the Deputy Governor, Islamic finance is one of the fastest growing segments of the global
as well as domestic financial sector. “Given its global outreach, growing recognition as a prudent and
stable system and ability to provide financial solutions for all business needs, Islamic finance is all set to
establish itself as a better alternative to the conventional financial system having capacity to ensure
financial stability and inclusive economic growth.”

He said that global financial crisis in 2008/09 made western financial experts to look for an alternative
under which the international financial system could overcome the weaknesses of the conventional
system based on fixed predetermined return in the form of interest. The search was for a system which
leads to equitable treatment of all stakeholders under all circumstances. A lot of attention was focused
on solutions which are not far from the Islamic financing where system allows fairness of return, sharing
of risk and reducing income inequalities.

He said that Pakistan was amongst the first few countries that undertook the ambitious aim of Islamizing
the banking system. Significant efforts towards this end were made during the 1980s. However, it went
through rough ride until some 12 years ago when SBP allowed three types of Islamic banking institutions
i.e. full-fledged Islamic banks; Islamic banking subsidiaries of conventional banks; and Islamic banking
branches (IBBs) of conventional banks. Moreover, conventional banks having Islamic banking branches
were also allowed to have Islamic banking windows in their conventional branches.

Holistic approach needed for development of agri finance: Ishaq Dar

Federal Minister for Finance Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar has said that a holistic approach is
needed for development of agricultural sector and agri finance in Pakistan. He was speaking as
Chief Guest at the launching ceremony of the 2"" Challenge Round of Financial Innovation
Challenge Fund (FICF) on “Promoting Innovative Rural and Agriculture Finance in Pakistan” in
Islamabad today. The programme is being funded by UKAid and implemented by the State Bank
of Pakistan as part of “Pakistan Financial Inclusion Programme”.

He said that the partnership between DFID and SBP in promoting financial inclusion to reduce
poverty in Pakistan had further strengthened the bond between the two countries.
Congratulating the State Bank and the UK Government, he said that this would go a long way in
promoting inclusive economic growth through provision of demand-driven innovative financial
services for the low-income and unbanked population particularly our agricultural households
and rural entrepreneurs.

He reminded the audience of measures taken by PML (N) government in the 1990s which
included banking sector reforms in Pakistan, adding that since then, Pakistan’s banking industry
had witnessed a major transformation.

In his welcome address, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Acting Governor State Bank of Pakistan,
said financial innovation needs to be targeted towards the productivity of small farmers to
combat poverty in rural areas. He said that tackling poverty demanded fundamental rethinking
and innovation.

He reminded the audience that improving financial access to alleviate poverty was a global
challenge. “More than 2 billion adults in the world do not have access to formal or semi-formal
financial services. At the same time, one billion people with mobile phones do not have even a
basic bank account.”

He said that both the Government and the State Bank of Pakistan were addressing the
challenge using innovative policy approaches and actions.

Performance of the Banking Sector Remained Impressive: SBP

Substantial improvement has been observed in the banking sector during July-September quarter of
2014. The profit (before tax) reached historically high level of Rs 176 billion as of end September, 2014
showing 44 percent increase over the end September, 2013. Similarly, the return on assets (ROA) and
return on equity (ROE) inched up to 1.4 percent and 15.9 percent respectively up from 1.1 percent and
12.3 percent a year earlier.

The quarterly banking sector statistics for the quarter ended September, 2014, released by the State
Bank of Pakistan today, indicate that Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the banking system improved to
15.5 percent in September, 2014 compared to 15.1 percent a quarter earlier largely on the back of
healthy profits. The CAR at its existing level is well above the minimum ratio of 10 percent set by the
SBP, despite implementation of strict Basel-Ill capital standard. Encouragingly, the stress test results also
show that capital base of the system is strong enough to withstand unusual shocks due to credit, market
and liquidity risks.

The indicators of asset quality of the banking sector, with marginal changes, also reflect stability. Non-
Performing Loans (NPLs) to Loan ratio net of provisions at 3.2 percent in September, 2014 is far below
its peak of 6.4 percent in September, 2011.

Compliance of SBP Rules and Regulations —Correspondence with SBP

Attention of the Authorized Dealers is invited to the instructions contained in Paras 5 and 6 of Chapter |
and Para 4 of Chapter II of the F.E. Manual (Eighth Edition—2002) in terms of which they are, interalia,
required to bring Foreign Exchange Regulations to the notice of their customers and to ensure
compliance in their day to day operations. Further, Authorized Dealers are also required to refer to the
State Bank only those cases which they are not authorized to approve after satisfying themselves about
the bonafides of the applicants and the correctness of the statements made by them on the application
and the accompanying documents, if any, along with their recommendations/comments and
appropriate documentary evidences, according to EPD circular letter No 08 of 2014 issued to The
Head/Principal Offices of all Authorized Dealers in Foreign Exchange.

It has, however, been observed that the above referred instructions are not being followed in letter and
spirit by the Authorized Dealers. Further, it has been noticed that queries/clarifications relating to
various Foreign Exchange Regulations/F.E. Circulars/Circular Letters are sought from and cases are
forwarded to Exchange Policy Department directly either by field functionaries or different officers of
the Authorized Dealers without in-depth study of the instructions and knowledge of the concerned Head
of the Department/Group Head. This results in wastage of precious time and resources in unnecessary
correspondence with the Authorized Dealers.

In order to streamline the process for expeditious disposal of the cases/references, it is advised that
Authorized Dealers must ensure that the same are forwarded to Exchange Policy Department after
proper review/scrutiny in the light of above referred instructions. Further, henceforth all references
seeking clarification on the regulations/instructions and all other cases, except routine and prescribed
statements/returns/information, shall be signed at least at the level of respective
Departmental/Business/ Group Head of the bank. It may carefully be noted that the references/cases
received without following the above procedure shall not be attended and shall be returned back in
original to the respective Authorized Dealer.

It has also been observed during inspections of various banks that personnel handling foreign exchange

D-8 Central Banks Experts Meeting

 

SBP working on making financial markets more inclusive: Wathra

Acting Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has said that SBP has been
working on making financial markets more inclusive. Inaugurating the D-8 Countries’ Central Banks
Experts Meeting in Islamabad, Mr. Wathra stressed the need for continued collaboration amongst D-8 central
banks for inclusive economic growth. The meeting was held as part of the D-8 organization for economic
cooperation on promoting inclusive financial services and Islamic banking. Mr. Wathra informed the audience
that the SBP like many of the D-8 central banks has been working on making financial markets more
inclusive; “however, financial exclusion remains an impediment in achieving inclusive growth.”

Mr. Wathra told the audience that financial inclusion was SBP’s top priority and one of the pillars of its
financial sector development strategy. “So far SBP has been pursuing financial inclusion through various
policy and market interventions to promote technology based financial innovations and address market
imperfections. However, going forward, SBP is developing a holistic National Financial Inclusion
Strategy in collaboration with the World Bank. The national strategy will be developed through
consultative process.”

Mr. Wathra highlighted the fact that Pakistan had made significant progress in introducing Islamic banking
system in the country. “Islamic banks hold a market share of 9.6 percent and 10.4 percent of the total
banking sector assets and liabilities respectively, with a healthy asset quality and double digit return on
equity. Accordingly, SBP has recently adopted a holistic approach through a Strategic Plan for the industry for
next five years (2014-18), which sets the future direction of the industry and gives a consensus strategy to take
the industry to the next phase of growth and development.”

The D-8 Countries’ Central Banks Experts Meeting was held at the National Institute of Banking and Finance
(NIBAF), Islamabad. The meeting was attended by experts from D-8 central banks, members of private sector
industry and other officials. The experts shared experience of member countries and deliberated on further
cooperation in promoting financial inclusion, branchless banking and Islamic finance in D-8 countries.

D-8 is an organization for cooperation among 8 developing countries namely; Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia,
Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. The objectives of D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation
include improving all member states’ position in the global economy, diversifying and creating new
opportunities in trade relations, enhancing participation in decision-making at international level, and improving
standards of living.

SBP to facilitate general public in obtaining fresh notes on Eid

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to set up special counters at 150 designated branches of the
commercial banks to facilitate issuance of fresh currency notes to the public during the month of Ramzan
and for Eid-ul-Fitr, 2014. Issuance of fresh bank notes from these branches will commence from July 16,
2014 and will be made under the supervision of the officials of the SBP BSC. It may be added that during
Ramadan of 2013 only 91 branches were designated for this purpose, a step that helped the SBP to
provide fresh currency notes in a more effective manner and in greater quantity both in value and pieces.
Therefore, the number of such branches has been substantially increased this year as stated above. The
city wise details of these branches are available on the following SBP web _ link:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/BANKNOTES/2014/Designated-Branches.pdf.

 

The 150 designated branches will be in addition to the large network of commercial bank branches for
which additional fresh currency notes of small denomination will be issued by the field offices of the SBP
BSC. It will be the responsibility of the main branches of the commercial banks in the cities where SBP
BSC has offices to lift the fresh bank notes of small denomination and distribute among their branches
across the country keeping in view the business and size of the same. For this purpose, the SBP BSC has
issued detailed guidelines to the banks and has also put in place a mechanism for monitoring of bank
branches to ensure distribution of fresh notes as per plans to be submitted to field offices of SBP BSC.
SBP will penalize the banks violating these instructions.

The branches of commercial banks/microfinance banks will issue one packet each of Rs.10/-, Rs.20/-,
Rs.50/- and Rs .100/- to the visiting general public/account holders. To ensure efficient and transparent
issuance by commercial bank branches, issuance to general public / account holders will be made on
presentation of original Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) and a copy to be provided for
bank's record. The issuance of fresh notes from these branches will start from July 07, 2014.

With a view to address the public complaints, if any, in obtaining fresh currency notes from commercial
bank branches, the SBP BSC has also established a Help Desk in SBP BSC which may be contacted at
the telephone numbers 021-32455470 and 021-32455454. Complaints may also be lodged at the

Digital finance channels can lead to rapid expansion in access to financial services: Dar

Finance Minister of Pakistan Mr. Ishaq Dar has said that digital finance channels can lead to
rapid expansion in access to financial services, particularly to those currently not served, and
thus helps promote economic growth of the country.

He was addressing a State Bank of Pakistan’s International Branchless Banking Conference on
“Innovations in Digital Finance for Financial Inclusion’ in Islamabad which was also attended by
heads and representatives of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), National Database
and Registration Authority (NADRA), Department for International Development (DFID) and
World Bank’s affiliate Consultative Group to Assist the Poor(CGAP).

The conference was attended by over 300 participants from the Government, International Policy
Advisory Organizations, financial service providers, telecom sector and donors.

Mr. Dar said that digital payments can be an efficient and transparent medium for Government
payments. “By digitizing government to person (G2P) payments, our Government will
strengthen the e-Governance framework,” he added. He commended the successful experience
of digitizing the leading social welfare schemes of the Government for income support programs
and internally displaced persons. He expressed the desire of the government to work with global
agencies like UN’s Better-Than-Cash-Alliance to chart a roadmap for digitizing government’s
retail payments. Moreover, he stressed on the need to further develop the digital finance to
expand services to small farmers and pensioners. He also advised to strengthen the customer
grievances redressal mechanism.

While appreciating the State Bank of Pakistan for its strategic vision and commitment to improve
financial inclusion in the country, he added that SBPs financial inclusion policy framework and
branchless banking models are recognized globally. Pakistan’s microfinance and branchless
banking sectors have seen inflow of foreign capital and increased use of innovative technologies.

He desired to be personally involved in steering financial inclusions initiatives in the country
through the newly created National Financial Inclusion Council to assign the much needed
priority to this issue. The Council will draw membership from important stakeholders including
relevant Government ministries/departments, financial and telecom regulators and industry to set
and monitor activities and national targets for digital financial inclusion.

Earlier in his speech, Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra highlighted
that high level of financial exclusion has led our society to rely on excessive use of cash
especially for payments and savings which is risky, costly, and inconvenient to the businesses
and public at large. He pointed out that SBP-led initiatives stimulated the market forces to drive

State Bank keeps policy rate unchanged at 10 percent

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10.0 percent. The decision
was taken by the Central Board of Directors of SBP at its meeting held under the chairmanship of
Governor Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra in Karachi today.

The complete text of the decision is as follows:

The post July monetary policy decision period continued to witness stable macroeconomic conditions.
This was most visible in the headline variable of inflation that declined to 7.0 percent YoY in August
2014, which is its lowest level since June 2013. Moreover, after recording an improved 4.1 percent
growth rate in FY14, real economic activity is expected to continue in FY15. The other highlight of this
stability is the gains on fiscal liberalization: shrinking budget deficits, contained government borrowings,

and improved debt profile.

Following on the actual number of 8.6 percent in FY14, the average CPI inflation during Jul-Aug 2014 is
recorded at 7.4 percent. This declining trend is broad based since both measures of core inflation, Non-
Food Non-Energy (NFNE) and trimmed mean, also decelerated YoY to 7.8 percent and 7.14 percent in
August 2014 as compared to 8.7 percent and 7.9 percent in June 2014, respectively. Although actual low
inflation might weigh positively on market sentiments, it is the future path of inflation that matters for
monetary policy decision. The current outlook of around 8 percent average CPI inflation for FY15 might

change adversely if the subsidy to electricity is cut and Gas Infrastructure Development Cess is levied.

After demonstrating low growth since 2008, real economic activity started to show signs of revival in
FY14. Continuation of the current growth momentum, however, primarily hinges on agriculture
production in FY15. This is because Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) growth might remain constrained
due to continued energy shortages; reduced production capacity of independent power plants; low supply
of gas to fertilizer plants; lower domestic and international prices in the sugar sector; and higher

inventories and slower exports growth prospects in food and textile sectors, respectively.

Incorporating the latest trends in exports and imports, oil payments in particular, trade deficit is going to
dominate the composition of external current account deficit, even with a healthy growth in workers’

remittances. Declining private capital inflows, foreign direct investments in particular, would present

Robust growth in usage of electronic banking and payments
witnessed during FY 2013-14

In a rapidly evolving International Payments arena, Pakistan is also leaping forward as Fiscal Year 2013-
14 registered robust growth in usage of electronic banking and payments, according to the Annual
Payment System Review for the Fiscal year 2013-14 issued by State Bank of Pakistan. The progress
certainly bodes well for country’s electronic Banking and Mobile Banking since they have emerged as
fastest growing payment channels among all Alternative Delivery Channels (ADCs) in terms of volume
and value.

According to the details Internet Banking shows an impressive growth of 80% reaching 17 million
transactions and Mobile Banking shows a substantial increase of 149% reaching Rs.67.2 Billion, during
the year. Retail Payments during FY 2013-14 also registered inspiring growth and POS Transactions
reached 24 million, valuing Rs.124 Billion. These transactions are 33% higher in volume and 38.5% in
value. ATM transactions also recorded notable increase and stood at 258 million of value Rs.2.6 trillion,
showing a growth rate of around 30% in volume and value, whereas, volume and value of Call Center &
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Banking was 0.67 million and Rs. 9.5 billion respectively showing
growth rates of 4% in volume and 17% in value.

The report further discloses that Real Time Online Banking (RTOB) transactions have increased to
around 98.5 million in terms of volume and Rs. 30.2 Trillion in value showing a growth of around 11%
each. In Large Value Payments Systems, during the FY2013-14, RTGS processed over 600,000 payments
worth Rs. 149 trillion as compared to 488,018 transactions of value Rs.162 trillion in FY2012-13 showing
an increase of 23% while the value showed a decrease of 7.7%.

It is worth mentioning here that innovative products and channels are continuously being introduced by
different financial institutions and payment operators in financial markets across the globe. On the one
hand, the proliferation of electronic payment products like e-wallets, m-wallets, multi-purpose cards
and smart applications enabled by new technologies like Near Field Communications (NFC) cards and
MPOS is being witnessed, and on the other hand a variety of non-bank players like Payment System
Operators (PSOs) and Payment System Providers (PSPs) are entering into the market for collaborative
products and service innovations. SBP, being cognitive of these changes and realizing the need for
Pakistani market to remain aligned with the international developments, has been taking a number of
initiatives to promote efficiency, security, innovation, and mass acceptability while ensuring competition
and level playing field for all payment participants.

Macroeconomic indicators improve:
SBP’s Quarterly Report

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Second Quarterly Report for FY14 on the State of Economy,
today. According to the report, by the end of first half of FY14, there was a perceptible improvement
in the country’s macroeconomic indicators. Inflationary pressures have softened (post November);
pressure on FX reserves and the PKR parity has eased in December 2013; LSM is showing
improvement, which is supported by an increase in credit to the private sector; and as reported by the
Ministry of Finance, the fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP declined in first half of FY14.

The report says that improvement in the fiscal and external accounts in the second half of FY14
depends on the expected proceeds from the auction of 3G licenses and Coalition Support Fund
inflows. However, if expected official external inflows are realized in second half of FY14, SBP’s
FX reserves are likely to exceed our initial projection for the full year.

The report traced the recent comfort on the external side to an unanticipated US$ 1.5 billion inflow
into SBP’s reserves, which may have triggered market expectations that Pakistan may receive a
facility to defer oil payments in Q4-FY14. “Along with dampening inflationary expectations for the
remaining part of FY14, this has changed the market’s interest rate outlook. SBP projects average
inflation in FY 14 to be in the range of 8.5 to 9.5 percent.”

The report says that due to a decline in cotton production, the prospects of achieving the GDP growth
target in FY14 could be undermined. However, LSM continues to post strong growth, which bodes
well for the country’s overall economic growth. The rebound in LSM is supported by investments in
alternate energy sources; improved power supply (after the resolution of the circular debt); capacity
enhancement (in steel, paper, fertilizer, beverages, and rubber) in past few years; and increased
lending to private sector businesses, especially in fixed investment loans.

According to the report, government borrowing from commercial banks also increased in the second
quarter. It mobilized Rs 188.1 billion from commercial banks during the quarter, against a net
retirement of Rs 179.1 billion in the first quarter of the year. Government was not able to contain its
borrowing from SBP within the limit agreed with the IMF. “However, with the bilateral inflows in
February and March 2014, and other external inflows expected in second half of FY14, these targets
should be easier going forward.”

The report says that because of a slowdown in spending and an increase in revenues, the fiscal deficit
during first half of FY14 narrowed to 2.1 percent of GDP, compared to 2.7 percent in the same period
last year, as reported by the Ministry of Finance.

State Bank launches KAP Study report on Islamic banking

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has launched the survey based report; “Knowledge, Attitude and Practices
of Islamic Banking in Pakistan” on October 3, 2014 at LRC auditorium, SBP, Karachi. The ceremony
was chaired by Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan and attended by
presidents of banks and senior industry representatives, Shariah scholars, reputed members of academia,
officials of DFID, World Bank and other reputed national and international organizations.

Governor State Bank encouraged the industry to focus on research and development to develop
innovative financial solutions that can meet needs of growing clientele of Islamic banking industry. He
emphasized that while Islamic banking industry has established its foot prints in international and local
market, the industry should not be complacent and stride towards bringing it closer to the key objectives
of Islamic economic system; transparency, social justice and equitable distribution of wealth. He formally
launched the KAP report and appreciated the efforts of Islamic Banking Department, and EdBiz
Consulting Ltd for successful completion of the project and thanked DFID for financing the study.

Subsequently, a detailed presentation on the survey findings was delivered. The first known initiative of
its kind, the study has quantified the demand for Islamic banking in the country both for retail and
corporate customers and has also identified demand supply gaps. The survey has a nation-wide
representation of 9,000 households (Banked and Non-Banked) and 1,000 Corporate.

According to the survey there is an overwhelming demand for Islamic banking in the country that is
evenly distributed amongst rural and urban areas, varied income strata and education levels. According to
the analysis pent-up demand for Islamic banking is higher amongst retail (95 %) than businesses (73%).
The study indicates that individuals in rural areas or in low income brackets have relatively limited access
to financial services. This highlights a huge opportunity for Islamic microfinance in rural areas.

The study recommends that the role of Shariah scholars needs to be further enhanced and made more
public in promoting Islamic banking and finance. Lack of general awareness about Islamic banking has
emerged as one of the key challenges confronted by the industry.

The study indicates that rural markets, SME, agriculture and microfinance sectors have got huge
financing needs and are potential markets for Islamic banking. It can also be inferred from findings of the
study that Islamic banks are desired to significantly improve their investments in expanding their outreach
to 2""! and 3” tier cities both to improve their visibility across the country and also to increase their
interaction with local businesses and trading communities. According to survey findings, given the
supply-demand gaps, there is huge potential for further development of Islamic banking in Pakistan.

Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Saeed Ahmad in his closing remarks informed the
participants of measures taken by the central bank to address the keys challenges facing the Islamic
banking industry. Mentioning the resolve and commitment of the Government of Pakistan for promoting
Islamic banking in the country on sound foundations the Deputy Governor shared with the audience
progress of the National Steering Committee on Islamic Finance.

for uniform cheque printing standard

State Bank of Pakistan has decided to implement a uniform standard for cheque printing across
the banking industry in Pakistan and prescribed guidelines relating to the layout of cheques. June
30, 2014 has been set as the deadline for implementation of the standard.

per the new standard upon the exhaustion of existing stock or by the deadline, whichever comes
earlier, and to issue only the new standardized cheque books after the said date.

Banks and financial institutions have further been directed to ensure that clearing stamps are
affixed on the reverse side of the cheque, not on the obverse, so that no material part of the
cheque is defaced. SBP advised banks to ensure that the size of stamp is in accordance with the
requirements of new standards.

The circular advises the banks and financial institutions to take all possible steps for creating
awareness and educating their customers and staff about the new standards and instructions, and

SBP Deputy Governor emphasizes the need for strengthening

Corporate Governance in Microfinance sector

Mr. Saeed Ahmad, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan, while speaking at the launching
ceremony of Microfinance Corporate Governance Training Program at a local hotel in Karachi,
said that microfinance sector has witnessed remarkable growth during past few years. He said
that the growth and development of Pakistan’s microfinance sector was attributable to the

visionary leadership and ownership at the highest level at the SBP.

He reminisced that the journey started in 2000 to promote access to finance by creating a new
class of banks dedicated to provision of financial services to the poor and low-income segments
of our society. He said that the same vision has been consistently pursued by successive
leaderships at SBP. The legal and regulatory framework of Pakistani microfinance was built on
the strong foundations and strategic direction by State Bank’s leadership which is internationally
acclaimed today.

He said that building on this strong leadership legacy, the current SBP leadership was deeply
committed to take the agenda of ‘access to finance’ to the next level. Mr. Ahmad said that
strengthening of governance structures of microfinance providers was critical to achieving scale
and institutional development by addressing key challenges. He added that the sector had
become complex and diversified, seeing new types of players such as telecom companies,
insurance companies and commercial banks entering the market.

According to the Deputy Governor the landscape in terms of funding for the sector was also
changing and the ability of institutions to access commercial funds was increasingly gaining
importance. He said that the core objectives of a strong corporate governance structure should

World Bank Country Director meets SBP Acting Governor to strengthen cooperation
on financial inclusion

The World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, Mr. Rachid Benmassoud, called on Governor (Acting)
State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Saeed Ahmad, to enhance collaboration under ongoing projects for
implementation of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy and explore new opportunities for
strengthening of the banking sector.

Mr. Saeed Ahmad highlighted the fact that financial inclusion has been recently elevated to global
development agenda due to its significance for improving livelihoods and its prevalence across the
world. Evidence suggests that countries with a clear financial inclusion strategy achieved better
results as compared to those which have no strategy. He pointed out that financial inclusion is very
important for Pakistan as it is critical for poverty alleviation and attaining financial stability. He
conveyed his appreciation for creating the environment for mutual collaboration.

Mr. Rachid Benmassoud said that the World Bank valued its partnership with SBP for universal
financial inclusion in Pakistan and the partnership has been recently acknowledged even at the World
Bank’s Board level. He shared that the World Bank has been working on a Country Support Paper
(CSP) which will provide technical assistance for implementation of the recently adopted National
Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to promote universal financial inclusion in the country.

The State Bank launched Pakistan’s first ever ‘National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS)’ at a public
event which was chaired by Finance Minister, Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar on 22"" May 2015 at
Islamabad. The strategy was developed in collaboration with the World Bank and through an
elaborate consultative process with all stakeholders. The strategy has been instrumental in creating a
common national vision for universal financial inclusion in Pakistan and will inform all stakeholders
about their respective roles and responsibilities towards achieving the national targets for financial
inclusion. A high level NFIS Council which is chaired by the Federal Finance Minister, and Governor
SBP, Chairmen of SECP, FBR, PTA and Provincial Finance Secretaries as members, will oversee its
implementation. The NFIS Steering Committee which is chaired by SBP Governor with high-level
technical representation from the relevant public and private sector stakeholders will implement the
Strategy under the guidance of the NFIS Council with support from various technical committees. The
WB and SBP also exchanged views on technical assistance for banking sector, including Enterprise
Risk Management, and other sectors of the economy.

IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey - SBP inks agreement with IBA

The signing Ceremony of Consumer Confidence Survey between State Bank of Pakistan and Institute
of Business Administration (IBA) was held at the State Bank of Pakistan, Karachi today. Governor State
Bank Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Director Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Dr Ishrat
Hussain oversaw the signing of the agreement on behalf of their respective organizations.

It may be recalled here that in January 2012, SBP inaugurated the Centre for Survey Research (CSR),
in collaboration with the IBA. This inauguration was followed by the launch in Jan 2014 of a dynamic
web portal [http://dsqx.sbp.org.pk/ccs/index.php] at SBP’s website containing the necessary
information on the survey and the latest data. In this centre the teams from IBA and SBP meet every
other month to collect data on households’ views about various economic propositions.

Shedding light on the importance of the project for SBP and its stakeholders, the Governor stated
that consumer confidence and inflation expectations reflect the confidence of households in the
economy which in turn reflect the state of the economy.”The expectations regarding inflation,
interest rate, stock prices, and employment are important for policy formulation, which explains why
many developed and developing countries are using consumer surveys for policymaking and research
purposes,” he added.

Referring to the flagship Annual, Quarterly Reports and Monetary Policy Statements, the Governor
said “Increased attention to these concept developed therein reflect the maturing of the consumer
confidence project.” The Governor also acknowledged the value addition to the understanding of
inflation in the country by the development of Administered Price Index (API) by the Pakistan Bureau
of Statistics (PBS).

It is worthwhile to mention here that scientific and dependable evidence on the expectations channel
in Pakistan has been rare. Being the Central Bank the SBP enhanced efforts to collect information on
these expectations, in order to undertake meaningful research, which is well-supported by the first-
hand knowledge of the prevailing situation in the country. Important results are available on CCS
web portal in the working paper by Abbas, Beg and Choudhary (2014), ‘Inflation Expectations and
Economic Perceptions in a Developing Country.

The Governor also spoke on the choice of IBA as partner in this project and said that SBP wanted to
partner with a reputable institution to ensure and address any possible Central Bank bias. “I am glad
that we were able to collaborate with a reputable public institution like the IBA in the
accomplishment of this task,” said the Governor adding, “Today we will further solemnize this
partnership.”

Dr. Ishrat Hussain, Director IBA, in his address said that the renewed partnership between SBP and
IBA showed that IBA’s team was able to deliver the project up to the standard required by the Central
Bank. He said that in a country like Pakistan project completion is a novelty because there is general
lack of know-how about successful ‘implementation’ of projects. He said that this project is also a
good example of an educational institution meeting the demands of a policy-making organization,

SBP remains vigilant of foreign exchange market

The State Bank of Pakistan is cognizant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly
observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. Yesterday, financial markets across the globe
witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets.

Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of
devaluation of Chinese Yuan on 11™ August 2015, currency depreciation around the globe,
particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their
currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is
also part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe.
This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward
movement of the exchange rate. As a result, on 24"" August 2015, Pak Rupee depreciated against the
US Dollar to close at Rs.104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4
percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year.

It is important to realize that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not
due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through
sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent
developments do not pose any serious challenge to it. Our external sector is robust and reserves are
at historically high level.

SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable, going forward, and may even strengthen depending
on the relative movement of international currencies. Nevertheless, it is keenly watching the
international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching
the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by
their speculative activities. SBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets
and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.

SBP Releases its Third Quarterly Report for FY15 on the State of the Economy

State Bank of Pakistan has submitted the third quarterly report of the Central Board of Directors to the Parliament.
According to SBP Report on the State of Economy, the third quarter of FY15 ended with a visible improvement in the
country’s macroeconomic environment. External sector improved considerably: (a) the current account, benefiting
from a robust growth in workers’ remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support Fund, and a sharp reduction in
oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15; and (b) the SBP’s liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen
a year ago, enough to finance three months of the country’s import bill.

The resulting stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on the benefit of fall in
international oil prices to domestic consumers and the prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI
inflation down to a decade’s low, but also eased inflation expectations as shown by IBA-SBP’s Consumer Confidence
Survey. The reduction in inflation is broad-based: all measures of core inflation (non-food-non-energy, trimmed, and
Relatively Stable Component of CPI) posted noticeable declines during the period of analysis.

The Report added that the budget deficit during Jul-Mar FY15 slightly narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared
with 3.9 percent in the same period last year. FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which
were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Unlike the revenue side, the government efforts
to control spending supported fiscal consolidation. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15,
against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. It is also encouraging to note that lower growth in expenditures was
not at the expense of development spending, which grew by over 20 percent YoY during the review period.

According to the Report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary
borrowing from SBP; instead, it retired a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during Jul-Mar FY15. As a
result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-Mar 2015,
but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.

With these improvements, the policy focus is gradually moving from stabilization to economic growth. SBP has
already initiated monetary easing to support economic activity by cutting its policy rate to a historic low. This policy
reversal is likely to support credit to the private sector, which grew by only 5.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15,
compared with 10.0 percent during the same period last year. Investment, which has been a key concern for
economic growth in recent years, is likely to benefit from monetary easing and planned investment under the China-
Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The Report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell
short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist.
Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large
scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during
the same period last year. Despite relatively low growth in commodity producing sectors (agriculture and industry),
services managed to grow by 5.0 percent in FY15, which was higher than 4.4 percent of last year.

Press Release

SBP plans to revisit its Interest Rate Corridor

In order to further strengthen the transmission of monetary policy and have the desired effect on
term structure of Interest Rate, the State Bank of Pakistan is reviewing its interest rate corridor
framework. According to the SBP, a main feature of this planned improvement is the introduction of
‘SBP Target Rate’ for the money market overnight repo rate. ‘This rate will be in addition to SBP
Reverse Repo Rate (ceiling rate) and the SBP Repo Rate (floor rate) of the corridor,’ says the SBP.
Moreover, this rate will be specified within the corridor — lower than ceiling rate and higher than floor
rate. In this context a proposal will be submitted to the Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy
(ACMP) in its March 2015 meeting, for review and its recommendations to the SBP Board. Later on,
the SBP Board of Directors will make a final decision about needed improvements in interest rate
corridor in its March 2015 meeting. More details of the proposed plan are available on SBP website at
the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/dmmd/interestRateCorridor.pdf

Press Release

GOVERNOR STATE BANK ASK BANKS TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY

Governor State Bank Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has stressed upon the banks to focus on private
sector lending and deposit mobilization. In this context he said that the average spread of all banks
continue to remain high and should be reasonably rationalized. “SBP shall review the position by the end
of June 2015 and may take regulatory measures to lower the spread,” he added.

He was addressing a meeting of Presidents/CEOs of all commercial Banks and DFls at SBP Head office in
Karachi today. The Governor took stock of operational activities and performance and issued important
directives to enhance the efficiency of banks.

Discussing the condition of Islamic Banks and its profitability, Governor highlighted that Islamic banks
should reward their customers appropriately in line with their surging profits. “Banks were advised to
come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply Shariah compliant measures to address the issue,”
he instructed.

Mr. Ashraf Wathra told the banks to improve their foreign exchange related services for the small
customers. ”The staff needs to be appropriately trained, and products developed to assist public in the
easy execution of their genuine foreign exchange transactions such as fees or medical expenses,” he
observed. He advised that all possible measures should be taken at institutional level to improve the
quality of services. He said that SBP will also review its foreign exchange circulars to facilitate the banks in
this regard.

Urging the banks to realize the efforts required for maintaining foreign exchange reserves, the Governor
emphasized that banks should discourage import of non-essential items by reviewing their internal credit
policies. On the other hand, he directed the banks to facilitate the exporters to the maximum to promote
growth in exports and thus the economy. He was also critical of the banks for inefficiencies of their
overseas offices. “SBP has been receiving requests from different banks to have their representation
overseas but on the contrary, performance of existing representative offices is not productive.
Therefore, instead of having overseas offices, banks should perhaps consider subsidiaries in foreign
markets as “exchange companies” which may further help home remittances as well,” he elaborated.

Talking about the IT security management, the Governor State Bank stated that banks must strengthen
their back up support and improve security measures. He also pointed out towards the need to improve
capacity of bank staff to upscale their service standards and run banking operations. He offered that
banks could be facilitated by the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) and Institute of
Bankers (IBP) to train the human resources at different levels. The Governor added that branchless
banking agents also need to be trained.

The Governor advised the banks to improve the functioning of their ATMs as unavailability of ATM
services is akin to going to a bank branch counter which doesn’t have cash. The banks were advised to
ensure round the clock services of their ATMs for the public.

SBP Releases its Second Quarterly Report for FY15 on the State of the Economy

‘After facing some difficulties in the initial months of the fiscal year, the economy ended the first half
of FY15 with some positive developments,’ says the second quarterly report of the Central Board of
Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan presented to the Parliament today. These positive
developments include a decade low inflation; contained budget deficit along with its improved
financing mix; comfort in balance of payments mainly on the back of sharp decline in global oil prices;
increase in forex reserves; and stability in the exchange rate.

However, the report comments that the persistent structural weaknesses, particularly energy
shortages, low FDI, losses of PSEs, and low tax-to-GDP ratio still continue to take a toll on the
country’s overall economic performance. ‘In order to address these issues and to put the economy
on a higher growth trajectory, bold policy measures along with better overall governance are
inevitable,’ the report concludes. The report presents a detailed analysis of various sectors of the
economy, with some the key observations as follows.

Preliminary information about the real sector suggests a mixed picture of the economy. Prospects of
a better wheat crop, and some improvement in minor crops, are likely to offset the performance of
cotton and sugarcane. However, farmers’ income may be adversely affected by higher input cost
(especially fertilizer), and the decline in output prices of cash crops. On the other hand, the industrial
sector is struggling with energy issues, as shown by a modest growth of 2.3 percent in the large-scale
manufacturing. Within services sector, it seems challenging for some sub-sectors (like wholesale and
retail trade) to achieve their target growth rate, while others (like banking) can perform well.

The commercial banks aggressively participated in primary auctions of longer-term securities as they
anticipated a cut in the policy rate and also took advantage of the healthy term premium on PIBs.
The government also accepted huge sums in these auctions to lengthen the maturity profile of its
debt, and to substitute some of its borrowings from SBP. This enabled the government to contain its
borrowing from SBP within the ceiling agreed with the IMF, and meet the limit of zero quarterly net
borrowing from the central bank.

On the policy front, low inflationary outlook allowed the central bank to reduce interest rate in
successive monetary policy announcements from November 2014 onward. The SBP has, so far,
reduced the policy rate to a decade low of 8.0 percent. SBP supplemented its policy decisions with
increased OMO injections during this period.

In terms of the country’s fiscal performance, the budget deficit as percent of GDP was 2.2 percent in
the first half of the year — slightly higher than the last year’s level. The government (federal and
provincial combined) was able to contain expenditures growth to only 4.8 percent during this period,
compared with 10.7 percent in the same period a year earlier. Encouragingly, current expenditures
were controlled, while development expenditures showed a robust growth. The financing mix of the
budget deficit also improved with higher availability of external resources and less pressure on
banking system.

Governor’s remarks on CPEC not quoted in its entirety: SBP

China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is one of the most important initiatives of the government in recent times
and is expected to play a significant role in accelerating economic growth of the country, going forward. The State
Bank is fully aware of broader contours of this initiative, unfolded to dateand has full confidence on its potential to
play the role of a game changer for the country.

On Friday last an interview given to a foreign news agency has been reported in a way that portrays Governor SBP
apprehensive of the CPEC project. The same story has also been published in various local newspapers later on as
well. The views expressed in the interview have not been referred in its entirety. The transcript of expression on the
subject has been the following:

“we have CPEC in the lime light now which is a large investment program...well with debt some equity would also
come...| think CPEC needs to be made more transparent...day before yesterday | was talking to the Planning Minister
that we need to share the blue print of the project with all and sundry so that people could find their roles in that
greater plan...right now... it is a bit of difficulty for analysts...if you ask me | don’t know out of 46 billion dollars how
much is debt how much is equity and how much is in kind...where the investor would only sell his machine... and that
will convert into a kind of debt with no inflows and in the longer run we have to make sure that we...have more
capability to export which most likely CPEC will itself be generating some export. There is a plan to have industrial
estates alongside this major route they are going to have with Chinese and Pakistani collaboration and these JVs are
going to be export oriented but we need to see this plan with more clarity”.

It would be pertinent to mention that regarding CPEC, Governor has expressed his optimism on several
occasions/interviews in the past and is in complete agreement with the government over its potential.

SBP Launches Videos and Smartphone Application
on Banknote Security Features

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) today, as a part of its campaign “Rupay ko Pehchano”, launched Videos
and Smartphone Application on security features of currency notes in a ceremony attended by high-
rank officials of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and presidents and senior executives of
commercial banks. The videos and Smartphone application are aimed at enhancing public awareness
and understanding of the currency notes’ security features thus enabling the public to easily
differentiate between the genuine and fake notes. A total of 5 videos have been developed, one each for
Rs.5000, Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes, one for Rs. 10, 20, 50 and 100 and the fifth highlights the
security features of all the currency notes in circulation. The smart phone application, downloadable
from both Apple and Android platforms, gives information on security features of currency notes both

in descriptive and pictorial forms.

The Governor SBP, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, while launching the videos and Smartphone
application said that SBP has adopted a three pronged strategy to combat counterfeiting which
involves: i) enhancing the security features of our currency notes to make counterfeiting even more
difficult; ii) automation of cash processing function in the banking system to ensure that no fake note
passes through the banking system; and, iii) creating awareness amongst general public about security

features of the currency notes to help them differentiate between genuine and fake notes.

He said that under the strategy some advanced security features are being added in the higher
denomination currency notes of Rs.500 and above and that the higher denomination notes with
enhanced security features, after approval by the Federal Government, would be available for issuance
by third quarter of Calendar Year 16. Further, in order to ensure that no counterfeit currency passes
through the banking system; a comprehensive cash management strategy has been issued to automate
banks’ cash processing functions by January 2017. SBP itself is in the process of installing state-of-the-
art high-speed banknote processing machines at SBP BSC Karachi and other important regions across

the country, he added.

Emphasizing the importance of the videos and Smartphone application the Governor said that the key

deterrent against currency counterfeiting is the public awareness about the security features of currency

Pakistan ranked among top five countries in the Global Index on Financial Inclusion 2015

Pakistan’s financial inclusion ranking has been elevated to number 5 in the Global Index on Financial
Inclusion, two notches up from the 2014 ranking as revealed by the Economist Intelligence Unit’s
(EIU) Global Microscope 2015 Report.

The EIU Report attributed the improvement in Pakistan’s ranking to the top level commitment,
consistency, and major financial inclusion initiatives implemented by State Bank of Pakistan during
the year. It particularly pinned Pakistan’s financial inclusion progress on a very well documented and
articulated National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), policy on Asaan Accounts, passage of Credit
Bureau Act, membership of global Better Than Cash Alliance, and Financial Literacy Initiatives. The
report also highlights some key challenges facing Pakistan in NFIS implementation including the
constrained supply of credit to underserved markets, deficiency in land titling and registration, the
absence of a secured transaction framework and electronic collateral registry for movable assets, and
lack of capacity in both financial institutions and clients. It is important to mention that NFIS has
already prioritized these challenges and will build momentum to push forward reforms to achieve
universal financial inclusion in an integrated and sustained manner.

The Global Microscope Report 2015 assesses the regulatory environment for financial inclusion across
12 indicators and 55 countries. The country rankings are based on their progress and commitment to
financial inclusion, regulatory and supervisory environment, market infrastructure and financial
stability etc. Microscope 2015 is directed towards practitioners, policymakers, investors, and other
stakeholders in the area of financial inclusion to help drive financial inclusion through their respective
roles.

Warehouse Receipt Financing can turnaround Pakistan’s
agriculture sector: Saeed Ahmad- Deputy Governor, SBP

The Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mr. Saeed Ahmad has said that Warehouse Receipt
Financing was one of the most important initiatives in terms of promoting post harvest agricultural
finance in the country. He was addressing leadership workshop on “Warehouse Receipt Financing in
Pakistan” organized jointly by SBP and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Karachi.

While addressing the senior executives from banking, insurance and development organizations, Mr.
Saeed Ahmad highlighted that in Pakistan, post harvest losses were estimated to be around 25-35%
of crops and horticulture irrespective of the fact that a big part of our population remained
malnourished.

He said that Pakistan is one of the leading agricultural producing countries in the world. However,
shortage of warehousing & storage facilities, lack of standardization, non existence of independent
collateral verification, lower access to financing and non-availability of transaction data has hampered
the development of an efficient commodity trading market. This in turn has led to excessive produce
wastages, high price volatility, and lower levels of farmers’ access to finance. He termed Warehouse
Receipt Financing as an initiative which could turn around the country’s agricultural landscape.

Deputy Governor informed the participants that SBP has been collaborating with SECP for formulating
a regulatory framework for establishment of commodity Warehouse Receipt Financing mechanism.
He appreciated the role of Pakistan Mercantile Exchange (PMEX), banks, insurance companies, FAO,
and other stakeholders and their joint efforts for scaling up of this financing system in the country.

He expressed his resolve and encouraged the participants to join in the efforts for the development
of a system to provide physical commodity storage, marketing, and Warehouse Receipt Financing
mechanisms in Pakistan. He assured that State Bank will continue to play its active role in this regard.

The event was also addressed by Syed Samar Hasnain- Executive Director SBP, Mr. Francisco
Gamarro- Deputy Representative FAO Pakistan, Mr. Krassimir Kiriakov- Expert Warehouse Receipt
Financing Voca Consultant UK, Mr. Fahadullah Khan- CEO ACE Global Depository Services Pakistan,
and Mr. Hasan Mahmood- Head of Research, Product Development & Risk Pakistan Mercantile
Exchange (PMEX).

Around 130 senior executives of banks, insurance companies, SECP, FAO, PMEX and other
stakeholders attended the event which was followed by a two day Training of Trainers (ToT) session
for around 50 participants from banks and other stakeholders.

PROVISION OF CIB INFORMATION TO CONSUMER COMPLAINANTS

State Bank of Pakistan has issued a circular instructing all Banks/Development Finance Institutions,
(DFIs)/Micro Finance Banks (MFBs/)Non Bank Finance Companies(NBFCs)/ Modarabas that in case
of recovery against overdue/write off/late payment, the bank /Financial Institutions (FIs) will clearly
mention in the clearance letter that history of overdue/write off/late payment will continue to be
reflected in credit report for a period of one year.

SBP has further advised that banks/FIs should provide complete information to borrowers while giving
financial relief in the form of write off/ reversal of mark up and will categorically inform them in
writing that this financial relief will be reported to CIB. Banks will have to ensure that reporting to CIB
is invariably discontinued immediately after the settlement and closure of facility.

It may be recalled here that State Bank of Pakistan has been receiving a number of complaints wherein
various issues are being raised by the customers related to their CIB information uploaded by the
banks/FIs. It is pertinent to mention here that the banks/FIs and not State Bank of Pakistan report
customers in CIB database.

Also, it has been observed that while issuing clearance certificate to their customers after receipt of
overdue amount, the banks/FIs do not mention that their overdue/write off/late payment history in CIB
report will continue to be reported for a period of one year from the date of adjustment of overdue
amount. The customers, therefore, have understanding about clearance of their liabilities immediately
after payment, which subsequently leads to unnecessary correspondence/ legal proceedings against the
banks/FIs and State Bank of Pakistan;

While giving some financial relief to the borrowers in the form of write off/ reversal of mark up, the
banks/FIs do not inform their customers that this relief will be reported to CIB database and will
continue to be reflected in their CIB reports for a period of one year.

Some of the banks/FIs misguide their customers to approach State Bank of Pakistan for any correction
in their CIB report; despite the fact that any amendment is required to be made by concerned bank/FIs;

Development of skilled HR base is critical for sustainable growth of
Islamic Banking in Pakistan: Ishaq Dar

‘The development of skilled human resource base is critical for sustainable growth of Islamic
finance industry in Pakistan,’ says the Federal Minister for Finance Senator Muhammad Ishaq
Dar. He was speaking as chief guest at the launching ceremony of the 3"" Challenge Round of
Financial Innovation Challenge Fund (FICF) on ‘Promoting Excellence in Islamic Finance’ in
Islamabad today. The program is being funded by UKAid and implemented by the State Bank of
Pakistan as part of Pakistan Financial Inclusion Program.

He said that the partnership between Department for International Development (DFID), UK and
SBP for promotion of financial inclusion has further strengthened the bond between the two
countries. Congratulating the State Bank and the UK Government, he hoped that the initiative
will go a long way in promoting inclusive economic growth through provision of demand-driven
innovative financial services for unbanked population particularly the low income households
and rural entrepreneurs.

In his welcome address, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor State Bank of Pakistan said that
the establishment of Centre of Excellence for Islamic Finance would contribute significantly
towards developing a more inclusive Islamic financial system leading to financial products with a
closer link between finance and real economic activity. He also believed that the Centre would
serve to provide Shariah based solutions for financing needs of all segments including the
government and monetary policy instruments for the central bank.

He said that since financial exclusion was quite pronounced in Pakistan, both the Government
and the State Bank of Pakistan were making efforts to address the challenge using innovative
approaches and actions. Emphasizing the full commitment of the government to provide
sustainable financial access to the under-served economic and geographic segments including
youth, women, and SMEs, Mr Wathra said that the role of multilateral institutions and bilateral
donors particularly the UK Aid has been critical.

Mr. Saeed Ahmad, Deputy Governor SBP, emphasized the importance of knowledge and
education in light of teachings of Quran & Sunnah. While speaking at the event, Mr. Ahmad
affirmed SBP’s vision to flourish RIBA free economy in Pakistan. He assured that Govt and SBP
were committed for promotion and development of Islamic financial industry through innovative
solutions that are not only Shariah compliant in the form but also in line with the Maqasid e
Shariah.

‘The eventual aim of this FICF Round is to establish Islamic finance education and research
infrastructure in partnership with leading higher education institutions in Pakistan to serve the
Islamic finance industry in meeting its growing human resource and knowledge requirements
through quality and value added services and knowledge products’ said the Deputy Governor.

He shared that an independent FICF Advisory Committee, drawing representation from DFID,
HEC, private sector, and the SBP, will review and approve the challenge round winners. Detailed
guidelines, in print, were distributed and are also placed on SBP website for further guidance.

PRESS RELEASE
KASB BANK: SBP CLARIFICATION

The State Bank of Pakistan as part of its mandate is responsible for protecting the interest of
depositors and ensuring stability of the banking system. Fulfilling its mandated
responsibilities State Bank assesses fitness and propriety of every prospective investor in a
bank beyond a defined threshold (currently 5%), so as to ensure that the investor is capable
of fulfilling the fiduciary responsibilities and can be entrusted with the license to collect
public deposits.

Due to persistent losses for the last five years KASB bank’s equity had eroded significantly
and was much below the regulatory Minimum Capital Requirement, its Capital Adequacy as
of 30-09-2014 has also turned into negative thus technically rendering it insolvent. Because
of the weak financial health of the bank and inability of its sponsors to meet capital
requirement of State Bank, in the best interest of the depositors and other stakeholders, had
to request Federal Government to place the bank under moratorium. The Federal
Government imposed the moratorium on the bank and also directed State Bank to prepare a
scheme of reconstruction / amalgamation in accordance with the law.

The sponsors of the bank filed a writ petition against the State Bank of Pakistan and others at
Islamabad High Court; however, the petition was subsequently withdrawn unconditionally.

State Bank of Pakistan has noticed that post withdrawal of the petition rumors have been
spread that some Chinese investors have struck a deal with State Bank of Pakistan. State
Bank denies any such deal and clarifies that a Chinese investor approached State Bank
through the bank’s existing shareholders. SBP informed the prospective investor to establish
its bonafide and has to clear Fitness and Propriety criteria. They were also guided about the
position of the bank and information required to be submitted in order to assess their
request. However, they could not submit any of the required information. An entity whose
beneficial ownership is not clear cannot be entrusted with the license of a bank.

Although the prospective investor under discussion has indicated to bring in some
investment by May 13, 2015 but in view of the quantum of deposits of the bank and the
Minimum Capital Requirement the committed amount of investment is very meager.
Further, the prospective investor did not share any information about how and from where
the funds would be mobilized.

State Bank of Pakistan, always welcomes the Foreign Direct Investment, however, this can be
accepted only within the bound of laws and regulations prevalent in the jurisdiction. State
Bank of Pakistan reassures the public at large that it is committed to strengthen the banking
sector of the country.

State Bank of Pakistan has confidence on NBP’s BOD and Management

State Bank of Pakistan is interalia, responsible for the stability of the financial system. After
the international financial crises, the regulators around the world have particularly given
more emphasis to the systematically important banks due to their role in financial stability.
Pakistan is no exception to that and the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) is one of the
systemically important banks in the country. In a certain section of the press a news item
refers to a letter from SBP to NBP portraying lack of confidence being shown by SBP on the
management of NBP and their Board of Directors. This is malicious and undermines the
governance of the largest and systemically important bank in the country and can potentially
shake the confidence of its stakeholders. The communication by the SBP is a normal course
of business action that is taken to ensure compliance of measures as considered fit by it.

Corporate Governance initiatives are a part of the over-arching role of the State Bank of
Pakistan and it does not undermine the role of the Board of Director (BOD) of any bank or for
that matter NBP in particular. State Bank of Pakistan has confidence on present NBP’s BOD
and its Management as they have already started showing progress keeping in view the
challenges of a large Public Sector Commercial Bank. Further, NBP has to comply with the
requirements of Banking Nationalization Act (BNA) as well while other private/privatized
banks are not required to follow BNA.

Fit and Proper test (FPT) of Management and BOD is a normal process carried out by SBP for
all banks, and in all cases of Key Executives, FPT documents are submitted to SBP. Since all
the existing board members and President of the NBP have been appointed following due
process after SBP’s clearance, as such no question arises about confidence in NBP’s BOD and
management.

SBP issues Draft Framework on
“Identification, Regulation/ Supervision of D-SIBs in Pakistan”

As part of its commitment to ensure stability of financial system and further strengthen the supervisory
and regulatory regime, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has designed a framework for “Identification,
Regulation/ Supervision of Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) in Pakistan”. SBP is seeking
comments on this document from the banking industry, academia, economists and other stakeholders
before implementation of the framework.

The focus on systemically important financial institutions came in the wake of the recent global financial
crisis. In November 2011, Financial Stability Board (FSB)/Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)
issued a G-SIFls framework for enhancing resilience of large financial institutions. Later in October 2012
the framework was extended to D-SIBs. Cognizant of the developments in international arena, as well
as to better manage build up of systemic exposures in the financial institutions of Pakistan, SBP has
designed the framework encompassing; (a) setting criteria for identifying the D-SIBs and (b) way forward
on policy implications with respect to D-SIBs to enhance their resilience . The framework adopts the
benchmark BCBS methodology for constructing criteria for identifying D-SIBs in Pakistan. Indicators
used to gauge systemic importance include: size, interconnectedness, substitutability and complexity.
Further, the framework touches upon the matter of possible specific regulations, monitoring, and
disclosure requirements for D-SIBs to maintain financial stability and reduce the probability of direct
support and implicit Govt. guarantee for managing D-SIBs during crisis.

It is expected that identification of the Domestic-Systemically Important Financial Institutions and
future work on development of regulatory and supervisory framework will go a long way in limiting
systemic risk and ensuring financials sector stability. The draft framework can be accessed on SBP
website at the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/osed/2015/Discussion-Paper-D-SIBs.pdf and
comments may be forwarded to: Sarwat.amir@sbp.org.pk, Rizwana.rifat@sbp.org.pk latest by
August 31, 2015.

through Mobile SMS service will commence from September 14, 2015.

Under this facility, a person will be required to send an SMS message comprising his/her
CNIC/Smart Card number along with desired bank branch code [e.g. CNIC Number (space)
branch code] to 8877. The alphas numeric branch codes of nominated e-branches are
available at SBP website www.sbp.org.pk and PBA website www.pakistanbanks.org In return,
the person will get SMS containing his/her transaction code, branch address and transaction

the former KASB Bank Limited are now depositors of
BanklIslami Pakistan Limited and are free to operate their
accounts maintained at the respective branches of the former
KASB Bank Limited as per their convenience.

State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges the patience shown by the
depositors of the former KASB Bank Limited as well as their
confidence on the regulator during moratorium period.

State Bank of Pakistan reiterates its commitment to safeguard
the interests of depositors and to ensure safety and soundness of
the banking system of the country.

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra - Governor SBP, unveils ‘Access to Finance (A2F) Survey 2015’
results

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has launched ‘Access to Finance (A2F) Survey 2015’ results
on Tuesday, 15th December 2015 at Karachi. Governor SBP, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra
while speaking at the launching ceremony said that A2F is part of the National Financial
Inclusion vision as it will serve dual purpose of gauging the impact of our financial inclusion
initiatives since 2008, and providing baseline data for the National Financial Inclusion
Strategy.

While addressing Presidents/CEOs of banks and key stakeholders, Mr. Wathra shared that
traditionally, one of the key challenges to access to finance has been the lack of demand side
information which is necessary for understanding the barriers to financial inclusion. Without
such information the market doesn’t have the insights and capacity to develop client centric
products and services. He hoped that the survey will help all the stakeholders in
understanding knowledge, attitude and practices of a common Pakistani when it comes to
managing financial matters.

On this occasion, Mr. André Oertel from M/s Horus Development Finance also made a
detailed presentation sharing the findings of the report.

SBP initiated the Access to Finance (A2F) Survey 2015 to assess the state of financial
access and usage in the country. This comprehensive country level study of more than
10,500 respondents was geared to measure and analyze the current and foreseeable
demand for financial services in Pakistan. The A2FS 2015 results show that access to
financial services has significantly increased in Pakistan since 2008, with 16% of the adult
population now having access to a bank account (including mobile wallets), improving from
11% in 2008. Moreover, 23% of the adult population has access to formal financial services
up from 12% in 2008. Furthermore, women have advanced remarkably in terms of financial
inclusion as now 11% of women are utilizing banking services, compared to only 4%
recorded in 2008.

This 2"" A2F Survey was carried out by M/s Horus Development Finance, International
consulting company together with local partner Gallup Pakistan.

The first Access to Finance (A2F) Study was conducted in 2008 which yielded a rich
database on all aspects of access to financial services and provided useful inputs for
analysis, planning and implementation of various initiatives and programs. The current and
previous survey results are available on A2F portal at www.A2FS2015.com.

Pak Rupee is in line with economic fundamentals

During the past couple of days the Pak Rupee has been once again facing speculative pressures due to
some recent newspaper articles criticizing external borrowing of government and the quality of
reserves of the country. These articles are highlighting just one aspect of the debt dynamics without
contextualizing it in Pakistan’s current performance and the overall macroeconomic stability.
Further, reference to reports by international rating agencies, such as Moody’s, is also being made
conveniently ignoring the strengths of the economy highlighted in the same report.

It would be pertinent to mention that the current level of exchange rate is broadly in line with the
economic fundamentals of the country. It is consistent with the improved external position of the
country, achieved through contained external current account deficit at low levels, continued surplus
in overall balance of payments of the country and built up of foreign exchange reserves to historic
high levels. SBP expects the external position to continue to strengthen and stands ready to take any
measure to ensure stability in the foreign exchange markets.

While referring to Moody’s reports, columnists have overlooked their recent assessment which noted
that “the support from multilateral and bilateral lenders bolster an improving foreign reserve position
and ongoing reform progress”. Moody’s have also mentioned that while Pakistan’s government
financing is mainly from domestic sources and system-wide external debt is declining as a percent to
GDP, the level of public debt poses a moderate degree of credit risk. It may be noted here that
Pakistan’s external debt obligation has actually decreased from 33 percent of GDP in FY10 to 23
percent at the end of FY15. Similarly, despite stagnant exports, the external debt to exports ratio has
declined from 300 percent in FY10 to 255 percent in FY15. Further, Moody’s have appreciated the
progress on structural reforms undertaken by Pakistan.

Borrowing externally is necessitated by trends in balance of payments in general and trade deficit in
particular. With shrinking of the current account deficit and with surplus in capital account, Pakistan’s
overall balance of payment position has contributed to the build-up of external buffers. State Bank of
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves is now over USD 15 billion at present, sufficient to cover four
months of imports, which is a marked improvement from 2013 when these were only USD 3.9 billion.
Apart from privatization proceeds, spot purchases from the interbank market amid falling oil prices
and rising workers’ remittances, Coalition Support Fund, and multilateral and bilateral inflows,
increase in foreign exchange reserves have also come from external borrowing, including that from
international capital markets.

Governor SBP calls upon banks to ensure ‘Fair Treatment of Customers’

State Bank of Pakistan Governor Ashraf Wathra has stated that financial institutions bear the
responsibility to be proactive in ensuring that their consumers are treated fairly. He was giving his
inaugural address to a seminar on Financial Consumer Protection organized by SBP under the
auspices of SAARC Finance here on Monday at National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF)
Islamabad.

The seminar was attended by the participants from central banks of SAARC member countries.
Local and foreign experts on the subject shared their views on financial consumer protection in
banks and the importance to conduct supervision.

The SBP Governor emphasized that enhancing consumer protection in banks eventually promotes
competition in the industry and it has positive linkages with financial stability and financial
inclusion. ‘The banks have to take a leading role in promoting and ensuring consumer protection in
banking sector,’ he said. He underscored the responsibility of the board of directors and senior
management of the banks in bringing a cultural shift to ensure fair treatment of the customers. He
further emphasized the importance of transparency and public awareness and suggested that the
banks should give its customer opportunity of taking informed decision by disseminating adequate
information at the time of offering a product or service. He urged the need for robust, fair, unbiased
and efficient complaints resolution mechanism within the banks.

He stated that Financial Consumer Protection should ideally rest on self regulation complemented by
regulatory reinforcement. He also highlighted the importance of market conduct supervision and
enforcement and stated that SBP is cognizant of its responsibility and gives equal importance to both
prudential regulation and conduct of supervision.

It was the first ever Seminar on Financial Consumer Protection at SAARC level aimed at providing
the participants an opportunity to share with each other the related policies and practices prevalent at
their respective jurisdictions, initiate healthy dialogue and explore new areas of cooperation.

Depositors of the former KASB Bank start transactions with BankIslami

State Bank of Pakistan is pleased to inform that the amalgamation of the defunct
KASB Bank into BankIslami Pakistan Ltd has been implemented smoothly. As a
result all the depositors which are over 150000 in number and have Rs 57 Billion in
deposits are free to operate their accounts. Many of them have already started
operating their accounts and more than 1200 employees have continued their jobs.

All the branches of the defunct bank, now taken over by BankIslami, remained open
for business on Friday, while the branches at major business centres also opened on

Saturday. The customers freely operated their accounts as per their convenience. So

far, no complaint of any sort has been reported and, in any such case, the customers

may contact their respective branches or call centre of BankIslami.

Regarding some apprehensions about the amalgamation of a conventional bank into
an Islamic bank, it is clarified that the process is in compliance of Shariah. The
Banklslami has planned to gradually transfer the defunct bank’s conventional
banking operations into Shariah based operations. The customers of the bank may
seek further clarifications from the bank management in this regard.

An important issue that is often debated in some quarters of the media is the
notional value at which the defunct bank has been handed over to BankIslami. In
this regard, it would be pertinent to mention that post due diligence, all the four
banks which had shown interest in acquiring the defunct bank had come out with an
estimated negative equity gap of Rs. 12 to 14 billion in addition to the shortfall in
Minimum Capital Requirement (Rs.10 billion). Following the international
practices, a notional value of Rs1000 was set for the defunct bank. There are many
examples of such international practices such as the sale of Barings Bank at a price
of 1 pound to ING group, Lehman Brothers Asia Pacific business taken over by
Nomura Holdings for consideration of only 2 US $ and Northern Rock taken over
by the government without any payment.

State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges the depositors' confidence in the regulator and
reiterates its commitment to safeguard the interests of depositors to ensure safety
and soundness of the banking system of the country. From now on it is business as
usual.

PRESS RELEASE

Governor SBP meets representatives of Exchange Companies

Mr. Ashraf Wathra, the Governor State Bank of Pakistan chaired a meeting today with the
representatives of the Exchange Companies at Karachi. During the meeting, issues relating to
prevailing exchange rate in the Kerb market, performance of exchange companies and the
role of their association came under discussion.

The Governor SBP highlighted different regulatory measures recently taken for providing
opportunities to exchange companies to expand their businesses. He, however, stressed the
exchange companies to play their role in stabilizing the exchange rate in the Kerb market.
The exchange companies were reminded that strict regulatory action will be taken against
those exchange companies who do not ensure meticulous compliance of the applicable rules
and regulations. While assuring the exchange companies to address their genuine grievances,
the Governor SBP apprised the participants that work is already underway in requiring the
importers to produce proof of payment at the time of Customs clearance of their goods.

The Governor emphasized that there is adequate supply of foreign exchange in the market to
meet the needs of the various stakeholders; hence the recent fluctuation of the exchange
rate in the kerb market is not justified. He further stressed the need for curbing speculative
trading which exerts undue pressure on the exchange rate. The gross reserves of SBP have
touched the all time high of USD 21 billion.

He also emphasized the need to make the association of the exchange companies more
effective in order to address related issues in a more coordinated manner.

Eurobond 2015 — looking from a broader perspective

Last week the government issued a 10-year USD500 million Eurobond in the international market
successfully at a cost of 8.25 percent. The same has been criticized by many of the financial journalists in
the print and electronic media on different grounds. This criticism is largely based on it being expensive
when compared with similar issues in the past. It is questioned that why despite a visible improvement
in the macroeconomic conditions of the economy Pakistan has not been able to sell it at a lower cost.
Timing to float this bond is also being criticized and considered as a reason for this high cost.

Despite the difficulties of timing, the issuance of the Eurobond was important for many reasons. While it
may be considered as relatively expensive comparing it with the past issues, it has many associated
benefits. Foremost, it is helpful to maintain the current year’s budgeted cash flows and meeting many of
the performance criteria set under the IMF program. The country is benefitting from a smooth sailing of
the program as many of the other bilateral and multilateral flows are contingent upon the success of the
program as well.

Another important contribution of the bond issuance is through maintenance of foreign exchange
reserves of the country. The foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank are currently well above the
minimum threshold of three months of imports, which is generally considered as adequate from external
sector sustainability view point. Continuing with such trend is important since availability of adequate
reserves support in attracting both debt and non-debt inflows of foreign exchange. Admittedly,
borrowing from the external sector has its limitations due to a rise in external debt as a percent of GDP;
but, currently Pakistan’s external debt to GDP ratio is well below when compared with its peer countries.

Issuing the bond at a price tag of 8.25 percent, similar to the price fetched in last year’s bond issuance, is
also being portrayed as negating the significant improvement in macroeconomic conditions over the last
one year. It would be pertinent to mention here that these improvements are reflected in undeniable
facts and country’s assessment by international rating agencies. Nevertheless, it must be understood,
that international investors are looking at other global factors as well, which may outweigh the positives
of an issuing country’s own conditions at times. Moreover, the overall market conditions are not the
same as few years ago.

With regards to the timing of bond issuance, there is a view in the media that a delay in the issuance of
bond would have been more appropriate as international investors appear to be jittery of current global
economic developments. In SBP view, such a delay would have only added to the cost of raising the
bond. More recently, US Fed decided to postpone an increase in its policy rate due to uncertain global
economic developments. The diminishing uncertainty over time will increase the likelihood of a rise in US
interest rates that would only reduce the interest in other developing countries’ papers. With increase in

Guidelines on Standardization of Payment

Orders (PO) and Demand Drafts (DD)

State Bank of Pakistan has issued guidelines on Standardization of layout and Security
features of POs and DDs. The move is aimed at addressing the risk of fraud, forging in
Payment Orders (POs) and Demand Drafts (DDs) and to safeguard the interests of
general public by reducing the risk of counterfeiting.

The said guidelines mandate the use of “Minimum Security Features” in the paper
used in printing of POs and DDs comprising of Watermark, Anti-Forgery Ink, Ultraviolet
Fibers etc. In the area of layout, Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) line, name
of Drawee Bank Branch (in case of DD), maintenance of purchaser’s record by the
respective bank branch etc. have been introduced.

Moreover, to facilitate customers, Banks/MFBs have been advised to devise a
centralized mechanism for the verification of genuineness of POs and DDs.

In this regard, Banks are required to Set up 24/7 helpdesks / call centers, so that the
person in possession of instruments is easily able to verify the genuineness of the
instrument. Bank branch shall validate the genuineness of PO / DD if the holder of an
instrument approaches in person to any branch offering online banking services. Banks
are also required to arrange proper training of staff to examine / verify the security
features / genuineness of PO / DD.

It may be recalled here that last year SBP had issued instructions for standardization of
security features and layout of cheques. Now by standardizing POs and DDs, almost
96% of total financial instruments in clearing process will be standardized resulting in
uniformity and increased efficiency in the process as well as facilitation of general
public using them.

All the Banks and MFBs have been advised to issue POs and DDs as per the new
standard with effect from April 1, 2016.

Wathra sees microfinance trajectory achieving vision of ‘financial inclusion for all’

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has said that with strong commitment of
the Government, SBP’s strategic vision, sound legal and regulatory foundations, robust market
infrastructure, technological and institutional innovations, and private sector dynamism, the
trajectory of microfinance is set for achieving the long term vision of “financial inclusion for all” in
Pakistan.

He was addressing the second International Conference on Economics and Finance in Kathmandu,
Nepal titled ‘Promoting Equitable Economic Growth through Inclusive Finance’ held by the
Nepal Rastra Bank.

Sharing his thoughts on the need for promoting equitable economic growth among South Asian
countries, the SBP Governor described in detail his vision on promoting inclusive economic growth
in Pakistan through financial inclusion. Wathra highlighted the fact that the global financial crisis
has pushed most of the emerging economies into difficult economic challenges in recent history. He
stressed that globalization has increased the need for regional economic and financial cooperation
among South Asian countries due to the cross border interdependencies and taking advantage of the
emerging opportunities.

Elaborating further, he said that the dwindling export earnings and receding foreign capital inflows
translated into foreign exchange market pressures. Therefore, added the Governor, ‘most of us were
challenged while we endeavored to stabilize our foreign exchange markets due to weakening of
exports earnings.’

He hoped that the common challenges faced by the South Asian countries would strengthen regional
cooperation to help our nations sustain and contain future down side risks transmitting from
advanced economies.

Referring to the strong fundamentals to the advantage of South Asian countries, Wathra recalled that
the region is home to around 1.7 billion people, with the youth in majority, thereby giving positive
population dynamics for both to grow fast and greater headroom in terms of debt carrying capacity
to continue economic expansion.

Sharing SBP’s experience in promoting an inclusive financial sector in Pakistan Wathra asserted that
Pakistan has kept pace with the changing global trends in policy and practice, and the State Bank of
Pakistan’s role has been pivotal in steering the sector with a strategic vision and pursuing a systemic
approach in developing the microfinance sector on sound footings.

Press Release
Pakistan’s economy faced several challenges during Q1-FY15 - says SBP report

The State Bank of Pakistan submitted its First Quarterly Report of FY15 titled ‘The State of
Pakistan’s Economy’ to the Parliament today. The Report says that Pakistan’s economy faced
several challenges in the initial months of FY15 as the fourth review of the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) could not be finalized in early-August meetings with the Fund. The Report also refers to
political events in mid August in Islamabad that impacted the economic activity in the country. In
September, floods inundated a large part of the country’s agriculture land in the Punjab. It was
feared these losses may push the price of perishable food items up, which fueled inflation
expectations.

‘Against this backdrop, key macroeconomic indicators could not follow up positive developments
observed in the second half of FY14. Q1-FY15 saw higher deficits in the current and fiscal
accounts, which had to be financed via domestic resources,’ the report concludes. According to
the Report, however, there has been a marked improvement in the economy during the second
quarter of FY15, which is likely to persist through rest of the year.

Highlighting developments in the external sector during the First Quarter of FY15, the Report says
‘Overall trade deficit increased by USS 1.6 billion in Q1-FY15, compared to the same period last
year’. This increase was partly compensated by USS 765 million increase in home remittances
during the quarter. The Report avers that the rising current account deficit, coupled with the
uncertainty in the FX market, was one of the key factors that guided SBP’s decision to keep
monetary policy tight during July-September, 2014.

The Report adds that government borrowings remained lower during Q1-FY15 compared to last
year because the government was able to borrow more from non-banks via PIBs and NSS. ‘Within
the banking system, instead of borrowing from the central bank, the government borrowed from
commercial banks, which also remained lower than the same period last year’, observes the
Report.

According to the Report, industrial sector is presenting a mixed picture. ‘Higher cement
dispatches, steel imports and strong PSDP spending, suggest a pick-up in construction activity in
Q1-FY15. Adding further, the report says, ‘In contrast, LSM growth posted a decline in Q1-FY15, as
local manufacturers faced gas shortages (especially in fertilizer, textiles, paper, glass and leather
sectors). Furthermore, textiles also remained dull on account of lower demand for yarn and fabric
from China and Bangladesh. The fall-out of a weak commodity producing sector can also be seen
in wholesale and retail trade activity. However, the vibrancy in finance and insurance, and
telecommunications, appears to have provided services a boost this year. ‘

Demonetization of All Old Design Banknotes

As per Federal Government’s Gazette Notification dated 4"" June, 2015, the old design banknotes will
cease to be legal tender with effect from 1'December 2016. Therefore, it has now been decided to

Monetary Policy Decision
November 21, 2015

The average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the
corresponding period of last year. The decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core
inflation measures came down in this period. Going forward, with subdued outlook of international
oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food
items, even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent,
the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum. Moreover, market surveys
indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.

Current account deficit, despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports, has narrowed
down to USD532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from USD1.9 billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement
largely owes to declining oil price - that has substantially reduced the oil import payments, healthy
workers’ remittances, and the realization of Coalition Support Fund. At the back of official
disbursements and Eurobond inflows, surplus in capital and financial account has supported the
overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange
reserves in Jul-Oct FY16. Going forward, continued flow of external resources would be required to
maintain the stable balance of payments position. Furthermore, realization of investment inflows
stemming from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector
outlook over the medium to long term.

Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM), mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers,
and cement production, increased to 3.9 percent in Jul-Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same
period of last year. Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn
manufacturing, strong construction activities as per planned development spending, increased
automobile production encouraged by government schemes, and improving energy supply at the
back of recent LNG imports.

Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015; wherein fixed
investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter - from Q2-FY15 to Q1-FY16. As
a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans,
at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September 2015, are the lowest in 10 years. Thus, with current credit
cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth, borrowing on account of both
the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase. This outlook would reflect in broad
money (M2) growth going forward, which during July 01-November 06 2015 M2 has expanded by
0.2 percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year. While the Net Domestic Assets
declined by Rs78 billion, Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it
increased by Rs106 billion.

In view of the foregoing, the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate
unchanged at 6.0 percent.

State Bank forms committees to scale-up warehouse receipt financing mechanism, and
increase agri-credit in under-served provinces

Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced formation of two
separate committees to scale-up warehouse receipt financing mechanism, and increased agri-credit in
under-served provinces and regions. He was addressing a Mid Term Review Meeting of the Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) for FY 2014-15 in Faisalabad today.

“During first seven months of FY 2014-15, banks have disbursed Rs.256 Billion of agricultural credit and
achieved 51% of the annual Agriculture Credit Disbursement Target which is Rs. 500 billion. This is an
increase of 35% compared to the disbursement made during the same period last year”. Mr. Wathra
shared with the participants. He congratulated the banks for their remarkable performance.

Mr. Wathra said that the performance of agriculture credit growth is on track, and sector is poised to
achieve over 53% of the agriculture credit demand in FY 2014-15 compared to only 39% in FY 2009-10.
Pointing out the gradual reduction of agri-credit demand-supply gap over the recent years, Mr. Wathra
urged up the banks to do more to further reduce this gap. He asserted that agriculture based growth has
positive and far-reaching influence on poverty alleviation, food security, export income and employment.

ACAC expressed the satisfaction over improvement in non-performing loans which has come down to all-
time low 11.4% alongside positive growth trends in banks’ agri-credit disbursements. ACAC was informed
that presently 33 financial institutions were proving agri credit in the country, compared with 20
Participating Financial Institutions in 2010. As a result, private sector banks including microfinance banks
are increasingly meeting financing needs of the agriculture sector.

Speaking to the audience, Mr. Wathra reiterated State Bank and government’s commitment in promoting
agriculture finance through inclusive and broad-based initiatives. He appreciated improving market trend
from being predominantly state-sponsored to being more open and market-led. He admired the
transformation brought about by diverse, strong, and forward-looking financial institutions. He also
appreciated the banks’ collective efforts in improving areas like product-mix, portfolio quality, and use of

SBP Issues instructions for Modernizing
Cash Management Function in Banks

State Bank of Pakistan has issued comprehensive instructions for modernizing cash
management function of banks. The instructions are part of a strategy for transforming the
cash management function from manual to automated environment and improving the
quality of banknotes in circulation.

A circular No. FD.03/2015 dated 26"" August 2015 says that from 2™ January 2017, the banks
shall only disburse machine authenticated and sorted cash to their clients/general public
from their branches/ATMs. For the purpose, the banks shall establish specialized ‘Cash
Processing Centers (CPC)’ having state of the art cash processing machines and storage
facilities. Alternately, the banks can have the requisite cash processing facilities at their cash
feeding branches and/or can make arrangements with other banks/ CPCs to get their cash
processed.

In addition, SBP has also introduced the mechanism of interbank exchange / trading of cash
whereby from 2"" January 2017 the banks will be able to exchange cash directly from other
banks and SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP-BSC) window will be used as only a last
resort to provide cash to the banks in case of shortages and to absorb access cash in case of
surpluses in the market. With the introduction of this mechanism from and January 2017, the
existing facility available to banks for deposit of re-issuable banknotes with the offices of
SBP-BSC will cease to exist.

The SBP-BSC offices will accept the surplus cash only as a last resort when this cash could not
be placed in the interbank market and that too against a service charge of 0.12% of the total
value deposited. The SBP-BSC shall however continue to accept soiled/unfit banknotes from
banks. The transition from the existing arrangement will be managed in an orderly manner.

The effective implementation of the instructions is likely to transform and modernize the
cash management function in the country, bring efficiency and transparency, check
counterfeiting of banknotes and significantly improve the quality of banknotes in circulation.

Press Release
Several key macro indicators recorded improvement, says the State Bank’s Annual
Report

State Bank of Pakistan today released Annual Report on the State of the Economy for the year 2014-
15. According to the Report, Pakistan’s economy did reasonably well during FY15, in contrast to a
number of other emerging economies that are facing slower economic growth. The real GDP growth
increased to 4.2 percent in FY15, and key macroeconomic indicators like inflation, fiscal balance and
current account balance recorded improvements.

The Report emphasizes on the improvement in the external sector given its significant positive
spillover to the rest of the economy. The external account improved due to a robust growth in
worker remittances and a sharp decline in global oil prices. As a result, not only country’s FX reserves
reached an all-time high level of USS 18.7 billion by end-June 2015 (sufficient to finance around 5
months of the country’s import bill), the exchange rate also remained stable during the year. More
importantly, the improvement in the external account significantly diluted the global risk perception
for Pakistan.

The Report further explains that the stable PKR parity kept CPI inflation under control, and lowered
inflation expectations in the country. However, the significant reduction in CPI inflation during FY15
was caused primarily by a sharp decline in oil and other commodity prices. The average CPI inflation
fell from 8.6 percent last year, to only 4.5 percent in FY15. A stable outlook of inflation and balance
of payments allowed policymakers to implement pro-growth strategies. For example, SBP cut its
policy rate by a cumulative 350 bps during the year to boost investment activities. Similarly, on the
fiscal side, development expenditures by the government remained strong through most of the year,
focusing mainly on infrastructure development.

While the Report recognizes the fiscal consolidation efforts of the government in terms of controlling
expenditure, it also points out structural weaknesses in tax collection. A sharp decline in oil prices
and subdued manufacturing activities during the year had made already sluggish tax collections more
difficult. The provincial budget surplus also recorded lower than the last year.

In order to finance the budget deficit, the government relied heavily on commercial banks, the Report
says. However, encouragingly, the government retired a large amount of its debt to SBP. In the
meantime, SBP continued liquidity injections to ensure adequate supply of loanable funds for the
private sector. Working capital utilization declined due to drop in commodity prices. A redeeming
feature has been the increase in long term financing which indicates new investment in plant and
machinery. Nevertheless, the overall credit to private sector remained lower than that in the
previous year.

According to the Report, country was able to marginally reduce its public-debt-to-GDP ratio mainly
due to revaluation gain from US Dollar appreciation against major currencies. The reduction in debt
burden was realized despite the successful launch of 5-year Sukuk bond in November 2014, which
allowed the government to raise USS 1.0 billion against the initial target of USS 500 million.

While the report welcomes positive developments in the economy, it reiterates several long standing
structural constraints (for example, low investment rate, low tax-to-GDP ratio, and continuing energy
shortages) that continue to hinder a sharp economic recovery.

charges should be reasonable, commensurate with the service and customers should not be charged for the
services not rendered or rendered without consent. Central Bank also encourages commencing awareness

State Bank of Pakistan Organizes International Conference on

“Affordable Housing & Mortgage Finance”

A two-day International Conference on Affordable Housing & Mortgage Finance organized
by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was inaugurated today in Islamabad. The Conference aims to
discuss innovative strategies and solutions to increase outreach of housing finance to low and
middle income groups.

At the beginning of the conference a message from the Prime Minister, Mian Muhammed
Nawaz Sharif, was read by the Deputy Governor, Saeed Ahmed. The Prime Minister said,
‘Pakistan is currently confronting a massive challenge of housing backlog of around 9 million
units, out of which, a large part pertains to the economically disadvantage families and
members of the lower middle class. This, coupled with a weak governance regime of urban
civic institutions, has resulted in the mushroom growth of katchi abadies and slums / squatter
settlements in major metropolitan areas.

In line with the manifesto of PML(N), our Government is fully committed to resolve the issue
of housing shortage in the country particularly for the low income groups. It has announced a
comprehensive housing finance scheme which includes construction of 1000 clusters of 500
houses each for low income families all over the country. To ensure cost-effective access to
credit for housing, government has undertaken to pick up a portion of the cost of financing on
behalf of the borrower over and above 8 percent under this program.

While addressing the audience, Mr. Akram Khan Durrani, Federal Minister for Housing &
Works who chaired the inaugural session, appreciated the steps taken by SBP to promote
housing finance. He stated that the provision of affordable housing and mortgage finance are
paramount to cope with rapid urbanization. He highlighted the various efforts by the
government to come up with affordable solutions particularly for people belonging to low
income strata and kachi abadis. He stated that SBP is actively involved in supporting the
sector. He emphasized that if proper planning is not undertaken for urbanization it may lead
to serious problems.

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, in his policy address shared
SBP’s policy framework for enhancing the flow of financial services to middle and low
income groups. Mr. Wathra, while asserting the importance of housing and housing finance
for the economy, said that the country is witnessing rapid urbanization and escalation in
property prices with increasing shortage of housing units especially for low and middle
income groups. In the absence of a sound and vibrant housing finance system, we can expect
the situation to further deteriorate. He appreciated DFID, World Bank, AFG and CSAPs for
their support in SBP/Mof efforts to improve upon financial inclusion in the country.

He further added that housing finance is one of the critical elements to make housing
affordable for the new entrants and existing incumbents of major metropolitan cities. The lack
of effective institutional framework, secondary mortgage market, high transaction costs,

ATM services and fresh currency notes to the public

State Bank of Pakistan held a meeting on July 10, 2015 with the Group Heads of Operations of all
commercial banks to address the distribution of fresh currency notes to general public,
uninterrupted availability of ATM services during Eid holidays and issues relating to deduction of
Withholding Tax (WHT) on bank transactions. The meeting was co-chaired by Mr. Muhammad Ashraf
Khan, Executive Director BPR Group and Mr. Qasim Nawaz, Managing Director, SBP-BSC along with

SBP-BSC and through new SMS-based mechanism. The banks were emphasized to ensure the
availability of fresh currency notes at their counters.

Commercial banks were advised to meticulously comply with the SBP’s guidelines and instructions
regarding management of ATM operations in order to ensure continuous availability of ATM services

tax filer. They were also advised to provide WHT statements to the customers.

Press Release

SBP revises Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility guidelines

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued revised Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility (MCGF)
Guidelines offering higher risk coverage of up to 60% to Commercial Banks/ Development Finance
Institutions (DFls) for lending to smaller Microfinance Banks (MFBs)/ Microfinance institutions (MFls). The
facility is expected to graduate smaller MFBs/ MFIs to avail credit lines from commercial banks/ DFls for
onward lending to microfinance clients.

It may be recalled that the Microfinance Credit Guarantee Facility is a credit enhancement facility to
attract market-based and long-term finance for microfinance institutions. MCGF was launched by the
State Bank in December 2008 with £15 million funding support from the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) under the Financial Inclusion Program (FIP) which is being implemented by SBP.

The facility is focused on market development and has been instrumental in resolving the
funding constraints of the microfinance sector in Pakistan. So far, 6 large MFBs/MFls have
completed 38 transaction with commercial banks and capital markets/retail investors mobilizing
Rs.12.825 billion for onward lending to around 650,000 micro borrowers. This has significantly
helped in reducing the risk perception of banks towards the microfinance sector, thus
introducing poor borrowers to mainstream financial institutions.

The revised Guidelines on MCGF have been issued by SBP through AC&MFD’s Circular No. 1 dated the
28"" January 2015. This supersedes all earlier instructions/guidelines issued in this regard.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 21, 2015

Increasing number of economic indicators in the current fiscal year have moved in a favorable
direction. Headline CPI inflation continues to follow a downward trajectory and is expected to
be well below the annual target of 8.0 percent; latest SBP projection range is 4-5 percent for
average CPI inflation in FY15. At the same time, GDP growth is on course to surpass the FY14
outcome. Owing to recent foreign exchange inflows and lower oil price, external sector outlook
continues to improve. Government's efforts to contain the fiscal deficit have been on track in
the first half of FY15, despite slightly slower growth in revenue collection. IBA-SBP survey-
based indices of March 2015 report increase in consumer confidence and in current economic
conditions. The current macroeconomic stabilization has thus opened a window of opportunity
to gear up reforms to ensure improvements in the economy are sustainable.

As per the recent trend, moderation in inflation is broad-based with food and non-food
inflations receding, both the measures of core inflation, Non-Food Non-Energy and Trim-Mean,
are also recording decline. However, due to current decline in inflation in general and
commodity prices in particular, there could be an increase in aggregate demand which may
have inflationary repercussions beyond FY15.

After growing by 2.2 percent in Jul-Jan FY15, Large-scale Manufacturing is likely to gain
traction due to recent cut in policy rate and low prices of raw materials that could boost the
manufacturing sector. In the agriculture sector, improved outcomes in major kharif crops (cotton
and rice, in particular) and incentives in place along with favorable weather conditions for rabi
season wheat crop, GDP growth is expected to be higher than that of FY14.

With strong workers’ remittances and declining import growth, current account deficit has
shrunk in Jul-Feb period of FY15 as compared to same period last year. The improvement is in
spite of subdued exports performance. Nonetheless, with lower price impact in imports and
multilateral inflows on track, the external sector outlook remains stable. This is most visible in
the stability in foreign exchange market and in an upward trajectory in foreign exchange
reserves.

During Jul-Feb FY15 period, Net Domestic Assets decreased and Net Foreign Assets increased,
which is a welcome development in contrast to the trends in the same period last year. The
Year-on-Year growth in broad money (M2) by February 27, 2015 was 11.5 percent; lower than
the average growth of 13.6 percent in the past five years. This deceleration is largely due to
contraction in Net Domestic Assets of the banking system. Growth in credit to private sector
during Jul-Feb FY15 has also remained subdued at RS 158.9 billion compared to RS 298.3 billion

The ceremony was also attended by Dr. Mu Yong Peng Vice Consul General Chinese Consulate,

period of time. The most recent among these is the establishment of Industrial & Commercial Bank

operating as a development finance institution for the promotion of trade, investment and economic

Mr. Wathra elaborated that Pakistani banks also have their presence in China as Representative
offices that include National Bank, Habib Bank, United Bank and Bank AL Habib. However, he
underscored the need for further improving the current banking links between the two countries.
“These financial relations are encouraging; however, I desire that the current banking links between
the two countries should improve further,” he said. He added further that the two countries have
strong trade ties but to bring them to the next level where Pakistani exports also become a significant
portion of the Chinese imports, the presence of a strong banking network is essential.

Automation of Form E----- SBP and FBR sign MoU

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Chairman FBR Mr. Tariq
Bajwa have shown optimism that automation of Form E will have manifold benefits to all
stakeholders and the country would reap advantages of increased inflow of foreign exchange.
‘The automation will reduce cost of doing business for exporters and will bring efficiency in
the system,’ the Governor said. The Chairman FBR remarked that automation of Form E will
also facilitate in efficient processing of duty drawback claims of the exporters as well as
preventing any fake/bogus documentation.

Governor SBP and the Chairman FBR were speaking at the signing ceremony of
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between State Bank of Pakistan and Federal Board of
Revenue (FBR) at SBP Headquarters today on October 26, 2015. In order to streamline
issuance of Form-E, State Bank of Pakistan and the Pakistan Customs had initiated a project
for the automation of the process of issuing Form-E. In this regard, an Electronic Form-E
(EFE) module has been developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and incorporated
in the Pakistan Customs’ electronic system called Web based One Customs (WeBOC).

The landmark development is expected to provide several benefits to stakeholders including
reduced cost of doing business for exporters, efficient processing of duty draw back claims of
exporters, elimination of fake/forged Form-E, improve repatriation of foreign exchange
besides bringing efficiency to the current system.

At present, most of the exports are processed through WeBOC but a small percentage of the
export cargo are being exported through the ‘One Customs’ system. Efforts are underway to
expand scope of the EFE module to export of such goods as well. Currently, Form-E is issued
manually by Authorized Dealers (Banks). The system will begin receiving applications for
EFE with effect from November 2, 2015, for exports taking place from November 11, 2015
onwards. The request for EFE will be submitted electronically by the exporter in WeBOC and
Authorized Dealer will approve or reject EFE electronically in WeBOC. Accordingly,
paragraph 36 has been added in Chapter XII of FE Manual 2002, which provides regulations
for issuance of EFE. However, for exports taking place through One Customs, manual Form-E
will be issued by Authorized Dealers as per existing instructions.

After electronic approval of Form-E by the Authorized Dealer, the exporter will attach EFE in
WeBOC with Goods Declaration (GD) Form to carry out export of goods for which Form-E
has been approved. The serial number of EFE for each Authorized Dealer will be generated by
WeBOC.

Authorized Dealer shall fill in relevant sections of Bank Credit Advice (BCA) for each EFE in
WeBOC, including the date of lodging shipping documents with Authorized Dealer,

The SBP conference on affordable housing paves the way for a
grand alliance between the public and private sector

The two-day International Conference on Affordable Housing & Mortgage Finance organized
by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was concluded today in Islamabad. The Prime Minister,
Mian Muhammed Nawaz Sharif, graced the occasion. The Prime Minister evinced keen
interest in the deliberations of the conference and offered his candid comments. He reaffirmed
the Governor State Bank’s reference to the fact that it is a formidable task and that a journey
of a thousand miles begins with a step. The PM appreciated the work and directed the SBP to
refine its proposal broadening its scope by including both the formal and informal sector.
Further, citing his own experiences in the past, he advised SBP to involve housing experts and
come up with a comprehensive proposal for his approval so that the vision of affordable
housing could be given a real impetus under his leadership.

The major gain of this international conference marks the beginning between the government
and the banking sector to accomplish the gigantic task of new cities with all the basic
amenities in the spirit of inclusive development. ‘We want to build dignified houses for the
downtrodden and not become a party to the perpetuation of a ghetto culture in the cities and
suburbs,’ he remarked. The Prime Minister pledged his unequivocal support for the initiation
of this task by providing his full support for an effective legislative framework and public
sector cooperation.

The concluding session was marked by an interactive discourse among the Prime Minster,
Finance Minister, SBP officials and the international experts which is a welcome departure
from a more generally formal template of the concluding sessions.

Earlier, the Finance Minister, Senator Muhammed Ishaq Dar while giving his remarks said
that the government has already taken steps to develop mortgage industry and promote
housing finance. In this regard, he mentioned the creation of Pakistan Mortgage Refinance
Company with a significant share of government in its equity. The government has also
initiated a Housing Finance Credit Guarantee Scheme, he said. The Finance Minister cited the
global examples where foreclosure laws have helped to promote housing finance. He assured
that the government would accelerate the process of foreclosure law to be passed from the
parliament to give effective protection and stimulate housing finance by the financial
institutions without any hesitation.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Ashraf Mehmood Wathra, in his welcome remarks
sought Prime Minister’s support to accelerate the process to bring in a legislative framework
to address the well known issue of repossession and recovery which is a pre-requisite for
providing mortgage finance to a borrower. This, he said, is central and the first step to realize
the vision of affordable housing for the poor and low income segment of the population. The
Prime Minister expressed his consent to the Governor’s suggestion and instructed Ministry of
Finance, later on, to accelerate the process. The Governor appreciated the valuable

Thursday May 14, 2015: Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, today, launched a credit
guarantee scheme for small farmers at Prime Minister Office, Islamabad. “The objective of the
scheme is to help our small farmers get bank loans more easily for producing their crops”, the Prime
Minister said.

economic challenges, energy shortage and worst security situation at that time. Since then, the
government has taken unprecedented measures to revive economy, improve law and order situation
and restore investors’ confidence.

While sharing the vision, the Prime Minister expressed his determination to consolidate the gains
made during the first two years of his government. He said that the initiatives like China-Pakistan
economic corridor and strengthening relationships with neighboring countries to eradicate terrorism
in the region will guarantee a strong and prosperous country.

commitment to support the small farmers in increasing their productivity and income levels, and
spurring growth in overall agricultural sector, he reiterated.

segments of the society to enable them to contribute in socio economic development of Pakistan. He

last year’s payments under Income Support Program were increased from Rs 12,000 to Rs 18,000 per
annum. He appreciated the role which the banks are playing in national economy but emphasized
banks to cater the financial needs of all segments of the economy rather than focusing on a few large
borrowers.

fully committed to providing an enabling environment for financing to agriculture sector and small
farmers through innovative and scalable products. He highlighted that the agri-sector has strong
linkages with the manufacturing sector and high significance for fighting poverty and generating large

PRESS RELEASE ON KASB BANK RELATED ISSUES

The State Bank of Pakistan as part of its mandate is responsible for protecting the interest of depositors and ensuring
stability of the banking system. The implication of issuance of a banking license is allowing an entity to take deposits
from general public for onward lending. With authority of taking public money comes responsibility. SBP as a matter of
prudence and fulfilling its mandated responsibilities assesses fitness and propriety of every prospective investor in a
bank beyond a defined threshold (currently 5%), so as to ensure that the investor is capable of fulfilling the fiduciary
responsibilities and can be entrusted with the license to collect public deposits.

In case of KASB Bank SBP intends to:

(a) ensure the payment of over 150,000 depositors with Rs 57 billion, and

(b) resolve the bank amicably in the best interest of all the stakeholders but primarily depositors and for the
sustainability of the banking system at large.

Historical Perspective of KASB Bank:

KASB Bank Limited (the “Bank”) has been facing severe capital shortfall in terms of both Minimum Capital Requirement
(‘MCR’) and Capital Adequacy Ratio (“CAR”) since 2009. As of September 30, 2014 the Banks’ MCR (free of losses)
was in the amount of Rs. 0.958 billion with a CAR of negative 4.63% against the required levels of Rs. 10 billion and
10%, respectively (i.e. shortfall of Rs. 9.04 billion in respect of the MCR and shortfall by 14.63% in respect of the CAR.

As a result of supervisory process/assessment by SBP the banks are put on resolution in view of the issues of
supervisory concerns. SBP started relevant measures when issues of supervisory concerns were detected in KASB
Bank.

Considering the Bank's weak solvency position and serious regulatory violations, SBP imposed certain limitations on the
bank and required the sponsors to inject capital.

However, neither capital was injected by the sponsors nor any serious resolution efforts were made. Rather, the bank
failed to comply with the limitations imposed by SBP. Consequently, sponsors and Board of Directors were advised on
3""4 June 2013 to sign an undertaking with SBP to fulfill several regulatory gaps and make up for deficient capital upto
May 2014 in installments.

Unfortunately, the sponsors and Board of Directors, despite SBP’s consistent persuasion through meetings and in
writing, failed to meet their critical commitment of capital injection. Ultimately, they were suggested to merge the bank
with any of the large banks, however, they failed to do that either. In 2014 the bank was again given an option by SBP
to merge with any other bank in the domestic market as appropriate. However, the bank’s sponsors failed to do the
same also.

In addition to deficient capital base, serious governance issues including involvement of sponsors in the day-to-day
affairs of the bank in violation of applicable regulatory instructions were noticed. The bank also transacted business with
its related parties/ associated concerns on terms and conditions that were detrimental to the interest of its depositors.
The sponsors’ and management's self serving practices caused considerable erosion in the capital base, asset quality
and earning capacity of the bank.

As already mentioned due to persistent losses for the last five years KASB bank's equity had eroded significantly and
was much below the regulatory Minimum Capital Requirement, its Capital Adequacy as of 30-09-2014 has also turned
into negative thus technically rendering it insolvent. Because of the weak financial health of the bank and inability of its

Press Release
25 July 2015

SBP Policy Rate unchanged at 6.5 percent

1. Improvements in macroeconomic indicators led SBP to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy stance and slash the policy rate by a cumulative 300 bps in FY15. The key
factors facilitating the decisions can be pinned down to a sharp decline in CPI inflation,
along with its benign outlook, and improvement in external account. In addition to this,
narrowing of fiscal deficit and continuation of Extended Fund Facility (EFF) improved the
market sentiments. These developments also led to an upgrade of Pakistan’s sovereign
ratings by international rating agencies in recent months. Macroeconomic stability thus
achieved should reflect positively on real economic activity going forward.

2. Following its declining trend in nearly every month of FY15, average CPI inflation came
down from 8.6 percent in July FY15 to 4.5 percent in June FY15. Some recent
developments such as lagged impact of monetary easing in FY15, expected higher
monetary expansion in FY16, bottoming out of inflationary expectations,’ and the base
effect of historically low inflation during the second half of FY15 might suggest slight
deviation in the disinflationary trend of FY15 going into FY16. However, there is no major
change in SBP’s previous inflation forecast.

3. There is a possibility of upward revision in energy tariffs in FY16 and an adverse impact of
floods on production of perishable food items going forward that could have an upward
pressure on inflation. Meanwhile, projections of high oil production and weak global
demand suggest that international oil price might not have bottomed out yet. Given the
recent behavior of Pakistani CPI inflation amid falling international oil prices, this could
result in keeping inflation on the lower side.

4. While GDP growth in FY15 at 4.2 percent was slightly higher than that of FY14, it
remained lower than the target. In particular, industrial sector missed the target due to
lower growth in Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) and electricity generation; however,
the activities in construction and mining and quarrying remained buoyant. Agriculture
sector despite some losses to major crops from untimely and heavy rains did mange to
record some improvement. Noticeable increase in growth, as in the previous few years,
came in the services sector.

State Bank of Pakistan employing all available

resources to curb menace of counterfeit currency

Recently the issue of counterfeit currency notes in circulation was discussed during a briefing given by a team from
SBP to the Senate’s Standing Committee on Finance. During the briefing the Chairman of the committee asked the
SBP team to look into the complaints by public about them having received such notes from some banks. It is
unfortunate that the issue was highlighted out of proportion in a section of the media with the connotation that
banks are involved in injecting counterfeit currencies in circulation systematically. The State Bank categorically
rejects any such news items and clarifies that the views expressed in the meeting have wrongly been presented in
the media.

The presence of counterfeit currencies is an undeniable fact not only in our country but across the globe and SBP
being cognizant of the issue has been taking necessary measures to deal with this menace.

While the primary responsibility to check the influx of counterfeit notes lies with the Law Enforcement Agencies
(LEAs), SBP has adopted a three pronged strategy to manage this risk. The strategy aims at: i) ensuring state of the
art security features in our banknotes, which are difficult to counterfeit; ii) developing necessary capacity and
infrastructure with banks to issue genuine and authenticated banknotes to the public; and iii) creating awareness
amongst general public about the security features of our banknotes. Following the strategy SBP has issued new
series of banknotes between 2005-2008 with significantly enhanced security features comparable with those of
Euro, Pound Sterling, and US Dollar.

In order to ensure that banks issue genuine and authenticated banknotes to the public, they are required to issue
only sorted cash to the public from their cash counters and ATMs. The cash received in the branches cannot be
issued unless sorted. Bulk of the sorting activity is, however, manual and vulnerable to human errors. To improve
this capacity, SBP has advised banks to install banknotes authentication and sorting machines. From 24 January
2017 the banks will only be issuing machine authenticated banknotes from their branches and ATMs.

To lead by example, SBP is also installing state of the art high speed banknote processing machines in its subsidiary
SBP-BSC, besides using the desk top note sorting machines. This measure will significantly improve the banking
system’s capacity to check the currency counterfeiting.

Also, SBP uses different measures to create awareness amongst general public about the security features of
Pakistani banknotes. Campaigns under the title “Rupae Ko Pechano” are run occasionally under which public
awareness programs are held across the country, besides newspaper advertisements, website pages, and placement
of posters at banks’ branches, SBP-BSC offices and other important public places. Recently, a short documentary on
the security features of the banknotes has been prepared, which is being launched during the current month.
Moreover, a smart phone application has also been developed to enable the general public to have complete
information about security features of banknotes on their finger tips. During the briefing to Senate’s standing
committee meeting, the committee was shown the documentary and apprised about the mobile application. The
committee was highly appreciative of the initiative and recommended the government to declare it a public service
message for its free of cost display on TV channels.

The success of these initiatives in minimizing the currency counterfeiting will, among others, also depend on public
cooperation in reporting of fake banknotes to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). People are hesitant in reporting
about finding fake currencies to LEAs to avoid procedural and behavioral difficulties. Reporting by the people is an
important step towards helping LEAs to apprehend the individuals/groups involved in the menace of currency

counterfeiting.

SBP revises criteria for renewal of license of Exchange Companies

The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to amend its instructions relating to renewal of
license of Exchange Companies (ECs).

companies was linked with the inspection rating of the respective exchange company.

State bank decided that henceforth licenses of exchange companies shall be renewed for five
years from the date of expiry of the license. However, license shall be renewed after giving
due consideration, inter alia, to SBP inspection report, compliance status, corporate
governance and financial health of the exchange company.

The request for renewal of the license must reach State Bank of Pakistan at least 60 days
before expiry of the license. All other terms and conditions on the subject shall remain
unchanged, says FE Circular No. 01 of 2015 issued to the Chief

Executives of all Exchange Companies.

Performance of the banking sector continued to improve: QPR
of the Banking System for March, 2015 quarter

The Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking System for the quarter ended 31% March,
2015 released by SBP today highlighted that the banking system posted profit before tax of
PKR 80 billion over the quarter indicating YoY growth of 58 percent. Accordingly, Return on
Assets (ROA) increased to 2.6 percent in Mar-15 from 1.9 percent in Mar-14. Solvency of the
system improved further as Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) increased to 17.4 percent as of end
Mar-15 from 17.1 percent as of end Dec-14 (against local bench mark of 10 percent and
international benchmark of 8 percent).

During the quarter, asset base of the banking system rose by 3.5 percent (Rs.422 billion) to
reach Rs 12.5 trillion. This growth came on account of increase in banks’ investment in
government securities, while advances observed net retirements primarily due to seasonal
adjustments and drop in commodity prices. With continuing accumulation of huge stock of
liquid assets in the form of government securities, the liquidity of the system remained at
comfortable levels.

According to the report, the asset quality slightly deteriorated; Non-performing Loans to
gross loans ratio increases by 50 bps to 12.8 percent and Net NPLs to Net Loans increased by
9 bps to 2.8 percent during January to March 2015. However, with increase in capital base
during the quarter, capital impairment ratio (Net NPLs to Capital) declined by 27 bps to 9.8
percent, thus decreasing risk to the future earnings and equity of the banking system.

The State Bank of Pakistan has commenced publishing Quarterly Performance Review (QPR)
of the banking sector from December 2014. The QPR for Mar-15 is placed at URL:

Monetary Policy Decision
September 12, 2015

Year-on-year headline CPI inflation decelerated to 1.7 percent in August 2015 from 7.0 percent
in August 2014. Following its declining trend of the past several months, the 12-month moving
average CPI inflation came down to 3.6 percent in August 2015 from 8.4 percent in August 2014.
Other indicators, such as core inflation measures, have also decreased in August 2015. Major
sources of declining inflation are favorable supply shocks and demand management policies.
The current deceleration owes much to the smooth supply of the perishable food items and
falling international oil price pass-through to consumer prices.

Continuation of current trends along with moderate pick up in aggregate demand would
largely determine the path of inflation in FY16. Recent increases in natural and compressed
natural gas prices and their likely second round impacts would be offset by lower global oil
price that has yet to find the bottom. Thus, there is no change in SBP’s forecast of average CPI
inflation for FY16 with its range of 4.5-5.5 percent remaining below the annual plan target of 6
percent.

There are, however, two possible upside risks to this forecast. Government plans of paring
down of subsidy on electricity along with increase in its tariffs and the possible adverse impact
of low food prices on crop production. Downside risks to the forecast include the lesser
likelihood of recovery in global commodity prices including that of oil. With current trends and
projections, the probability of downside risks appear to be greater than the upside risks.
Moreover, the latest IBA-SBP survey of September 2015 has reported lower inflation
expectations for the coming months.

The situation in external current account at the beginning of FY16 is not much different from the
end of the last fiscal year. While the exports again declined in the month of July 2015, external
current account deficit recorded slight improvement due to declining oil import payments and
increasing workers’ remittances. With favorable trends in these variables, a current account
deficit of the size of end-FY15 seems manageable in this fiscal year. This is supported by the
expected surplus in the capital and financial account in FY16 on the back of planned

Euro/Sukuk bonds inflows, official disbursements, and the remaining IMF funding under the
EFF program. Apart from yielding an overall balance of payments surplus, this would help
maintain the foreign exchange reserves’ upward trajectory of the last two fiscal years.

However, increases in exports and foreign direct investments are imperative for sustainability
of external sector. In this regard, recent improvements in law and order situation and continued
macroeconomic stability are likely to increase the prospects for long-term foreign capital

Liquidity management: SBP View

Liquidity management operations of SBP aim to achieve monetary policy objectives of price stability so as to
provide a facilitating environment for economic growth. In particular, the intermediate goal is to contain
the overall monetary expansion (M2 growth) within safe limits; consistent with price stability objective. This
is ensured by management of day to day liquidity in the banking system with a view to keep the overnight
money market repo rate within the interest rate corridor specified by SBP Repo and Reverse Repo rates. This
requires liquidity injections or mop ups at appropriate periods in time.

In recent times the liquidity injections by the SBP have increased considerably relative to its past trends.
Noticing these unusual changes, various market analysts perceive the SBP liquidity management to be
favoring the banks in making profit or supporting the government to meet its borrowing needs. These
perceptions are based on misconceptions and partial analysis of monetary variables. The SBP considers it
important to address these misconceptions to avoid misguided conclusions and expectations on the basis of
such analysis.

While assessing the liquidity conditions and analyzing the open market operations, it is important to keep in
view the overall growth of money supply in the system and its composition. Liquidity injections are
considered counterproductive only when given the inflationary outlook and monetary policy stance, they
are contributing towards excessive monetary expansion. Further, a lopsided contribution in growth in
money supply complicates monetary management. For instance, despite a contraction in net foreign assets,
high monetary growth led by government borrowing reflects external as well as fiscal imbalances, which had
been the case during last few years.

From the recent monetary aggregates data it can be observed that the overall monetary expansion (M2
growth) is not excessive; in fact it has decelerated compared to past few years. More importantly, the
composition of money supply is reflecting the positive changes occurring in the real economy. For instance,
the growth in M2 is being contributed significantly by an expansion in net foreign assets of SBP owing to
improvement in external sector. Moreover, the growth in private sector credit, albeit lower than last year,
has a reasonable contribution in monetary expansion.

Moreover, the improved fiscal discipline has resulted in lower government borrowing from the banking
system and changed its composition between the commercial banks and SBP considerably. The government
has in fact been retiring its borrowings from SBP. As a result, the liquidity shortage in the system has
increased considerably. To meet this, the SBP has been injecting liquidity, through its open market
operations, consistent with its monetary policy stance. If the SBP refrains from injecting liquidity in the
system, it could retard broad money growth leading to stifling of economic activities and thus a recovery in
growth.

Hence the quantum and frequency of liquidity injections through OMOs of SBP, even when they seem
excessive in isolation, are in fact necessary to keep money supply consistent with keeping inflation low and
provide support to growth.

RCG Asia conference--Governor SBP for expanding work done on resolution framework

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has outlined his outlook for the Regional
Consultative Group Asia (RCG Asia) and suggested that the RCG expand on the work done so far on
resolution framework as well as financial safety nets. “These initiatives will enable the member countries to
exchange fruitful ideas in order to get critical insight on these issues’, he added.

He was co-chairing the g” meeting of Financial Stability Board- Regional Consultative Group for Asia
(FSB-RCG Asia) alongside Mr. Norman T.L.Chan of Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The meeting was
held in Hong Kong SAR today on October 20, 2015.

In July 2015, Governor Wathra was appointed as the co-chair of Financial Stability Board- Regional
Consultative Group for Asia (FSB-RCG Asia) along with Mr Norman T.L. Chan of Hong Kong Monetary
Authority for a two-year term. The co-chairs are responsible for hosting RCG Asia meetings, conducting
workshops, coordinating with the FSB Secretariat, and attending FSB Plenary meetings.

FSB has been established to coordinate, at international level, the work of national financial authorities and
international standard setting bodies and to develop and promote the implementation of effective regulatory,
supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. In addition to its own
member countries, FSB through six regional consultative groups (RCGs) conducts outreach with another
approximately 65 jurisdictions. Formed in 2011, the RCG Asia includes central banks and financial
authorities of 16 countries.

During the welcoming remarks, the Governor also commented on sessions pertaining to retrenchment of
correspondent banking, wholesale market conduct, and deposit insurance.

During the meetings, the RCG Asia members discussed issues pertaining to vulnerabilities and financial
stability including global and regional developments. Further, they discussed market-based financing and
asset Management activities along with associated risks. Members also deliberated upon the potential
retrenchment of correspondent banking by large international banks in certain regions and for certain types
of clients. Moreover, members also considered fair and effective wholesale market conduct, wherein the
discussion focused on deficiencies in fixed income, currency and commodity markets practices.

Meeting was concluded with a session focusing on changes to deposit insurance systems (DISs) resulting
from the global financial crisis. The crisis resulted in greater convergence in practices across jurisdictions.

FSB has issued a detailed press release about the proceedings of the gh meeting, which can be accessed on
its website at www. financialstabilityboard.org

Zahid Hussain Memorial lecture: Innovative ways to encourage financial
inclusion of rural poor urged

Major goal of policy makers in developing countries is to develop innovative ways to encourage
financial inclusion of the rural poor. Enabling poor farmers to diversify into high value cash crops is
one of the best ways to achieve this goal, but farmers lack collateral. This was stated by Mr. Dilip
Mookherjee, Professor of Economics, Boston University, U.S.A. at Zahid Hussain Memorial Lecture
organized by the State Bank of Pakistan at Islamabad.

The lecture was attended by high level government officials, federal ministers besides faculty
members of various universities and bankers. In his lecture, Prof. Mookherjee expounded a new
approach towards financing of smallholder agriculture in developing countries

Mr. Mookherjee added that existing microfinance products play only a limited role in financing
cultivation by poor farmers. “Indeed, most microfinance include high frequency repayment, loan
officials actively discourage risk taking, and group-members that share loan repayment liability exert
peer pressure,” he said adding, ’Interest rates charged by most microfinance institutions often
exceed interest rates charged by informal lenders, which in turn are too high to allow poor farmers to
profitably grow cash crops.”

In this context, he particularly emphasized the role of ‘Trader Agent Intermediated Lending
(TRAIL)’ approach for financing the agriculture sector. Prof. Mookherjee shared that TRAIL
approach yielded better results as compared to Group-Based Lending in terms of loan take-off
preferences, timely repayment, impact on production and profit of the small farmers. In light of his
experience, Prof. Mookherjee suggested that “TRAIL is thus an innovative financial product with
potentially large development impacts, at lower costs for the lender”. He recommended this
approach as a viable (business) model of financial inclusion that can help policy makers and
practitioner to expand food production and manage poverty in developing countries. In this context,
he highlighted the pilot TRAIL run by the State Bank of Pakistan and called for collaboration.

Earlier, while introducing the Guest Speaker, Governor Sate Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf Wathra,
said that Prof. Mookherjee is an academic par excellence, having devoted his life to understanding
the problems that surround developing economies. He recounted numerous achievements of Prof.
Mookherjee and admired the relevance of his research in the context of developing economies.

Governor SBP reiterated the role of agriculture sector and its contribution to national economy. He
discussed the hurdles to an efficient agriculture financing and the weakness of the system, especially

Demonetization of All Old Design Banknotes

As per Federal Government’s Gazette Notification dated 4"" June, 2015, the old design banknotes will
cease to be legal tender with effect from 1* December 2016. Therefore, it has now been decided to
phase out all remaining old design banknotes of Rs 10, 50, 100 & 1000. The Rs 5 banknote and the old
design Rs 500 banknote have already been demonetized.

It is worth mentioning that the State Bank of Pakistan issued a new design banknote series which
started with the issuance of Rs 20 denomination banknote in 2005 to improve the security, durability
and aesthetic quality of banknotes. The process of issuance of complete series of new design
banknotes comprising eight denominations (Rs 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000) was
completed in 2008.

Banks surpass Agricultural Credit Target: Rs.516 billion disbursed in FY15

Banks have surpassed the agricultural credit disbursement target set by SBP’s Agricultural Credit
Advisory Committee (ACAC) for the year ending June 2015. Against the indicative target of Rs 500
billion (which was 28% higher than the actual agri credit disbursement of Rs.391 Billion in FY14),
banks have disbursed Rs 515.9 billion, which is Rs 15.9 billion in excess of the target set for FY15 and
31.8% higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs 391.4 billion. Growth was also recorded in the
agri. outstanding portfolio which stands at Rs 335.2 billion at end June, 2015 showing an increase of
Rs.45 Billion (up 15.5%) compared with the last year position of Rs 290.3 billion.

The agri. credit target of Rs.500 billion in FY15 (28% growth) was ambitious by any standards, given
the higher risk perception of banks about agri. financing and volatility in the prices of agri. produce.
Nonetheless, SBP adopted a multipronged strategy for achieving the target which included;
sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing as a viable business line, diversification of agri. lending
portfolio of banks, increase in per acre credit limits and extending the scope of eligible items,
development of new product eco-system including value chain financing, and inclusion of
Microfinance and Islamic banks for small and faith sensitive clients. Further, for deepening agri.
financing outreach, Fast Track Lending Program was launched during the year for farm and non-farm
activities in selected districts of the country. In addition, farmers’ awareness and financial literacy
programs were conducted at grass root level.

It is pertinent to mention that the agricultural credit targets have continuously been surpassed since
FY 2011-12 with an average real growth of 10.8% as compared with 3% growth in agriculture GDP for
the same period.

In addition to achieving the indicative agri credit target, SBP implemented all the budgetary
initiatives and projects in collaboration with banks during the year. These include enhancement of
the scope of Crop Loan Insurance up to 25 acres, rollout of Livestock Insurance for small farmers,
launch of Credit Guarantee Scheme for small and marginalized farmers, introduction of Warehouse
Receipts Financing and loans for solar tube-wells, etc.

These achievements were made possible because of the support of government and leadership of
the Governor, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and Deputy Governor, Mr. Saeed Ahmad through
conducting regular meetings of ACAC and performance review of banks.

A detailed review of banks’ performance for 2014-15 reveals that five major banks collectively
disbursed agri. loans of Rs 262.9 billion or 104.1% of their annual target of Rs 252.5 billion which is
higher by 34.5% from Rs 195.5 billion disbursed during the corresponding period last year. Amongst
the five major banks, HBL has achieved 113 % of its annual target, MCB achieved 102.6%, UBL
101.4%, ABL 101.2% and NBP achieve 100.1 % of its individual annual target. Among specialized
banks, ZTBL disbursed Rs 95.8 billion or 106.5% of its annual target of Rs 90.0 billion while PPCBL has
disbursed Rs 10.5 billion achieving 91.2% against its target of Rs 11.5 billion during FY 2014-15.

Fifteen Domestic Private Banks as a group achieved 94.1% of its target. Within this group Faysal
bank, Bank Alfalah, JS bank, Bank of Khyber, Bank of Punjab and Standard Chartered Bank were the
top performers surpassing their allocated annual targets. However, Summit bank achieved 99.6%,

Performance of the banking sector continued to improve:
QPR of the Banking Sector for June, 2015

The Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector for the quarter ending 30°"" June,
2015 released by State Bank of Pakistan today highlighted that the profit after tax of the
banking sector surged by 52 percent YoY on the back of both interest and non-interest
income. Accordingly, Return on Assets increased to 2.7 percent in Jun-15 from 2.1 percent in
Jun-14. Capital Adequacy Ratio remained strong at 17.2 percent well above the local
requirement of 10 percent and international benchmark of 8 percent.

During the quarter, asset base of the banking sector grew by 5.7 percent (YoY 19.2 percent)
compared to 3.4 percent in the corresponding period last year. Most of the increase in assets
resulted from growth in public sector credit for matching the fiscal needs and financing
commodity operations. The share of investments in total asset continued to increase due to
growth in stock of government securities.

According to the report, the asset quality observed some deterioration during Jun-15 as Non-
performing loans increased by 1.6 percent (YoY 5.8 percent) to PKR 630 billion. However,
with more than proportional increase in gross loans (4.7 percent), Non-performing Loans to
gross loans ratio decreased by 39 bps to 12.4 percent and Net NPLs to Net Loans decreased
by 18 bps to 2.7 percent during April to June 2015. On the funding side, steady growth in
deposit base continued to provide the needed resources for financing asset growth. With a
healthy increase of 7.9 percent over the quarter (YoY 13.6 percent), banks’ deposits reached
9.97 trillion in Jun-15.

The State Bank of Pakistan has commenced publishing Quarterly Performance Review (QPR)
of the banking sector from December 2014. The QPR for Jun-15 is placed at URL:

Finance Minister launches National Financial Inclusion Strategy for Pakistan

 

Friday, May 22, 2015: The Federal Finance Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today, launched
National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) for Pakistan at Islamabad. The objective of the strategy is
to build momentum and push forward reforms to achieve universal financial inclusion in an
integrated and sustained manner.

While sharing the vision, Mr. Dar said “Government is striving to create more opportunities of doing
business and make the common people of Pakistan self reliant and economically empowered.” In this
regard, the government is working at various levels to improve governance and availability of energy
and other key infrastructure inputs, he further said.

He highlighted that the recent historic agreement for creation of Pak-China Economic Corridor is an
economically vital plan devised to help drive Pakistan’s economic growth. The economic corridor will
connect economic agents and link economic centers with large resources which can be cultivated for
job creation.

While emphasizing the need for increasing access to fair and dignified financial services to achieve
sustainable economic growth, the Finance Minister said that the NFIS, championed by the State Bank
of Pakistan, is consistent with the Government of Pakistan’s Vision 2025, which calls for enhancing
access to credit for SMEs and focuses on strengthening & deepening of financial inclusion in the
country.

He regretted media speculations regarding imposition of tax on remittances in forthcoming federal
budget and categorically stated that no such proposal was under consideration by the federal
government.

He further pointed out that the Government is already working on some of the drivers that the NFIS
identifies to catalyze financial inclusion. In particular, digitization of payments is a priority area and
resolute efforts have been taken to support the digitalization of payments and give depth to financial
services among various segments of the population. He shared that Pakistan has become a member
of the Better than Cash Alliance - a global initiative. The contribution of branchless banking is
significant when it comes to channelizing the Government-to-Person payments.

Finance Minister emphasized the stakeholders to show their full commitment and active engagement
to increase access and quality of financial services for the underserved segments of the economy and
help to build a sustainable and prosperous Pakistan.

Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra, Governor SBP said that since the early
1990’s, Pakistan’s financial sector has witnessed considerable reforms that have significantly
strengthened its soundness, profitability, efficiency and diversity. Also, Pakistan has been a pioneer in
championing financial inclusion for over a decade and achieved a large number of significant
milestones. In particular, the creation of a regulatory framework for Microfinance Banks in 2001; the
expansion and modernization of online credit information bureau (e-CIB) in 2005; the adoption of

SBP Issues Monetary Policy Decision for Next Two Months

Macroeconomic conditions towards the end of FY15 have further improved compared to the
beginning of the fiscal year. Current account deficit has narrowed down; average annual
inflation is significantly below the target; there is a marginal uptick in real GDP growth; and
foreign exchange reserve buildup continues. All these developments were reflected in the recent
upgrades in outlook by international rating agencies that have further improved investor
confidence. The current macroeconomic stability achieved through domestic policies and
favorable external developments provide an opportunity to focus on reforms that will put the
economy on sustainable growth path.

With contraction in imports, led by sharp decline in oil prices, and strong growth in
remittances, the external current account deficit at $1.4 billion during Jul-Apr FY15 is around
half of the deficit recorded in the corresponding period of last year. The improvement has
overshadowed lower surplus in capital and financial account, especially weak foreign private
investment. Overall, this has supported the reserve building efforts with net SBP reserves rising
from $9.1 billion as of 30t June 2014 to $12.5 billion as of 15 May 2015. They are expected to
increase further due to subdued outlook of international oil prices, successful continuation of
IMF program, and realization of expected official foreign inflows. Increase in foreign private
inflows can further strengthen this outlook and sustain stability in the foreign exchange market.

The inflation continues with its downward trajectory in this fiscal year. The year-on-year CPI
inflation has declined to 2.1 percent in April 2015 from 8.2 percent in June 2014. The decline in
inflation during the current fiscal year has been broad based as all the headline and underlying
measures of inflation have recorded deceleration. Soft international commodity prices, stability
in exchange rate, contained government borrowings from SBP, moderate aggregate demand,
and SBP’s earlier conservative monetary policy stance have remained the key factors in
controlling inflation this year. Going forward, continuation of inflation at lower levels is
reflected in the latest IBA-SBP survey of May 2015 that reports subdued inflation expectations.
However, uncertainty about international oil prices and possible adjustment in domestic energy
prices are the main risks to this inflation outlook.

Credit growth during Jul-Mar FY15 has remained well diversified in terms of coverage and type
of finance. All three sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing and services - availed
credit both for working capital and for fixed investment purposes. The highlight remains the

Creation of a Special Unit in State Bank of Pakistan for Attending Issues of
Discriminatory Practices at Banks

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has been receiving complaints from various quarters regarding
discrimination by banks on the basis of high-risk category of customers including their status
as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).

SBP’s instructions issued vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 21 dated August 19, 2008 already
prohibit discrimination on the basis of specific occupation, trade, region, gender and other
factors while providing financial services in normal course of business. SBP has therefore,
reiterated that banks/DFIs should not discriminate any customer merely on the ground that
he/she belongs to a particular category of customers.

In this respect, State Bank has also advised all banks/DFIs to put in place an internal
mechanism for speedy handling of such complaints and nominate senior officers with the
responsibility of dealing with complaints and issues related to PEPs and for coordination with
the State Bank in the matter.

Further, a Special Unit in Consumer Protection Department (CPD) of SBP has been created
for handling grievances against such discriminatory practices. This Unit will monitor and
handle the complaints which remain unresolved by banks’ internal procedure.

Wathra for increased level of cooperation among
SAARC countries to fight global challenges

Governor and the current chairman of the SAARCFINANCE Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has said that
member countries can fight with growing global challenges with their collective commitments,
increased level of cooperation & information sharing, and efforts towards better shaping the future
course of the SAARCFINANCE.

He was addressing to the 7"" SAARC Finance Ministers’ Meeting held in Kathmandu, Nepal on 20""
August 2015. Mr. Wathra presented the progress report of the SAARCFINANCE - the Network of
SAARC Central Bank Governors and Finance Secretaries of the region.

The core objective of the Network is to promote dialogue on macroeconomic policies of the region
and sharing mutual experiences and ideas. In this context, the Network has initiated a number of
useful initiatives in order to achieve its objectives as envisaged in its terms of reference.

Mr. Wathra highlighted some recent initiatives undertaken by the SAARCFINANCE Network, such as
the availability of short-term liquidity for members under the SAARC Swap Arrangement; capacity
building programs for officials of members under the SAARCFINANCE Scholarship Scheme; the
dialogue and exchange of knowledge on issues of mutual interest through SAARCFINANCE Portal; the
creation of regional statistical database, and the recent initiative on collaborative research studies.
“These initiatives are beneficial in fostering closer relationships and building human capability in
practical fields of central banking amongst SAARC partners,” he added.

Mr. Wathra also shared the decision of the 30 Group Meeting of the SAARCFINANCE, which
identifies five areas for cooperation, which will ultimately work as a roadmap for the Network. These
five areas include reducing the transaction costs of cross-border remittances in the SAARC region;
cross-border trade in the region; capacity building of officials of member countries; the creation of
SAARCFINANCE statistical database; and undertaking of collaborative research studies to assess issues
of common interest.

Governor SBP expressed optimism that these areas for mutual cooperation would help us build a
clear mandate for future cooperation among the members.” The regional central banks have the
ability to form cohesive policies towards gearing up cooperation in banking and finance with a view to
facilitate cross border trade and investments, said the Governor adding, “We further intend to
integrate and improve our payments and settlement system.” Among others, the cooperation on this
specific area would help promote bilateral and regional trade besides strengthening financial
infrastructure in the region.

Mr. Wathra reiterated the need to take more initiatives and identify areas to further deepen
cooperation among member countries. He told that future role of the SAARCFINANCE will become
more challenging in the wake of high competition and growing economic and financial integration in
the SAARC region. In this context, the regional central banks would need to join hands with other
SAARC bodies and enhance coordination with them, especially with SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, as it is engaged in promoting cross border trade and investment flows.

State Bank of Pakistan reiterates its policy for
Promotion and Development of Islamic Banking

In order to remove any ambiguity and doubt among the general public, State Bank of
Pakistan has reiterated its commitment for promotion and development of Islamic banking in
Pakistan. Due to persistent efforts of the State Bank and the Federal Government, the share
of Islamic banking in total deposits of the banking industry has surged to 12.8% as of 30""
June, 2015 and is consistently growing with a cumulative average growth rate of over 50%
during the past 12 years. To-date 5 full fledge Islamic banks, one Islamic Banking Subsidiary
and 17 banks with dedicated Islamic Banking Branches are operating in the country with over
1700 branches spread all over the country.

Under the close supervision of State Bank’s Shariah Board, Islamic banking in Pakistan is
soundly founded on injunctions contained in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy
Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). State Bank has developed regulatory and
supervisory framework to ensure Shariah compliance of Islamic banking based on rulings of
its Shariah Board. Further, it has developed Shariah compliant open market operations for
managing liquidity of Islamic banking sector, which is quite unique in the Islamic world. State
Bank Shariah Board has also approved structure of Government of Pakistan Ijara Sukuk
issued in the past and all such structures for future issues will be approved by SBP Shariah
Board before their launch.

In December 2013, the Government of Pakistan had constituted a Steering Committee to
promote Islamic banking in the country and appointed Mr. Saeed Ahmad as the Chairman of
this Committee. Later on, Mr. Saeed Ahmad was appointed as Deputy Governor at State
Bank of Pakistan to spearhead promotion of Islamic banking. This created synergy between
the Steering Committee and the State Bank in their efforts to pave way for advancement of
Islamic finance. There is no precedence in the past that a Deputy Governor has been
appointed in State Bank of Pakistan with extensive mandate for Islamic banking in the
country. Later on, additional disciplines have been assigned to him for better coordination on
Islamic banking in those areas.

After completion of its first year, the Steering Committee has submitted its interim progress
report with set of recommendations to Federal Government. The mandate of the Steering

SBP simplifies instructions and procedure regarding remittances for medical
treatment and studies abroad

In order to facilitate resident Pakistanis to meet their individual foreign exchange needs, State Bank
of Pakistan vide FE Circular No. 08 of 2015 has simplified its instructions/procedure regarding

remittances/release of foreign exchange related to medical treatment and studies abroad.

As per revised instructions related to medical treatment abroad, banks have been allowed to remit
foreign exchange up to USS 50,000/- or equivalent in other foreign currencies to foreign hospitals on
account of medical treatment of resident Pakistanis on the recommendation of concerned medical
specialist/hospital in Pakistan. In addition, banks have also been allowed to release cash foreign
exchange equivalent to USS 5,000/- each to the patient and attendant to meet their cash foreign
exchange needs. Previously, the patient had to undergo a cumbersome and time consuming process
of getting recommendations from the medical board constituted by the Government and obtaining

prior approval from the State Bank of Pakistan in each case.

As regards simplification of instructions related to studies abroad, banks may remit foreign exchange
to foreign educational institutions on behalf of students desirous of studying in foreign institutions up
to USS 70,000/- or equivalent per student per calendar year as per the criteria set out in the circular.
Banks have further been allowed to release cash foreign exchange to the students equivalent to USS
5,000/- for meeting their initial living expenses. The previous instructions involved complicated
process and required excessive documentation and details before making remittances on above

account and the students had to arrange cash foreign exchange themselves.

In case of foreign exchange requirements for medical treatment and studies abroad in excess of the
limits set out in the circular, the concerned bank may forward the case to the Director, Foreign

Exchange Operations Department, SBP-BSC, Head Office, Karachi for consideration.

System for December, 2014 quarter

The Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking System for the quarter ended 31°
December, 2014 released by SBP today highlighted that “the operating performance of banks
shows marked improvement as profit before tax has surged by 52 percent (YoY) to reach PKR
247 billion during 2014”. “Accordingly, this is reflected in the profitability indicators; Net
Interest Margin (NIM) has increased to 4.4 percent in Dec-14 from 3.9 percent in CY13 and
ROA (before tax) has inched up to 2.2 percent in Dec-14 up from 1.6 percent in CY13”, the
report adds.

The report states that high profitability, capital injections by some banks, and debt-equity
swap of one bank has further improved the solvency of banking sector. With an increase of
1.6 percentage point, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the banking sector has reached at
17.1 percent, which is well above the bench mark of minimum 10 percent. The report
concludes that banking system is safe with strong capital cushion that may be utilized in
times of stress.

According to the report, asset base of the banking sector of Pakistan soared by 8.8 percent or
Rs.977 billion during October-December, 2014 to reach Rs 12.1 trillion. The report highlights
that improvement in economic activity and better energy supply to industrial sector
supported the 9.4 percent surge in advances during 2014, though the pace of advances
somewhat slowed down during October to December 2014 over the corresponding period of
last year. “Textile sector was the key user of advances followed by Food products and
Beverages, Production and Transmission of Energy, Automobiles, and Shoe & Leather” the
report says.

On the funding side, deposits growth of 5.6 percent during October-December, 2014 over
the previous quarter and 11 percent over the corresponding period of 2013 supported the
overall growth in balance sheet.

According to the report, the asset quality continued to improve as infection ratio further
receded by 70 bps to reach 12.3 percent and Net NPLs to Net Loans declined by 50 bps to 2.7
percent during October to December 2014. “The capital impairment ratio (Net NPLs to
Capital) also observed a substantial decrease by 350 bps to 10.1 percent indicating declining
risk to the future earnings and equity of the banking system” it added.

The State Bank of Pakistan has commenced publishing Quarterly Performance Review (QPR)
of the banking sector from December 2014.

SBP BSC Issues Fresh Banknotes Worth Rs. 249 Billion

During Ramazan 2015

SBP Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) made elaborate arrangements to meet the increasing demand for fresh
banknotes on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr 2015, with a focus to cover maximum stakeholders including the general
public.

According to the details the cumulative issuance of fresh banknotes by SBP under all arrangements stood at Rs.249
billion, as compared to Rs.154 billion issued on previous Eid-ul-Fitr. Out of this approx Rs. 31 billion comprised of
lower denomination notes up to Rs.100, while, banknotes worth approx Rs. 218 billion of higher denomination were
issued for meeting heavy payments & ATM needs of commercial banks.

To ensure maximum issuance, all 16 field Offices of the SBP BSC issued fresh notes to the general public from its
counters during Ramadan. In addition to this, SBP BSC established its own counters in 150 designated branches of
commercial banks. Through these two sources fresh banknotes valuing Rs. 12 billion were issued. Moreover, the
extensive branch network of commercial banks available across the country was fully utilized and provided fresh
banknotes worth Rs. 16 billion of lower denomination for onward dissemination to their accountholders and walk-in-
customers.

Apart from the aforementioned traditional modes of issuance, this year the SBP in coordination with Pakistan Banks
Association (PBA) introduced a new intervention of using Short Code service (on experimental basis) for distribution
of fresh notes. An overwhelming response was received to this initiative and we were able to cater to approximately
200,000 people in 07 days from 150 e-branches in 28 cities. This resulted in issuance of more than 93 million pieces
of lower denomination banknotes valuing approximately Rs. 3 billion to the general public through this medium.

Besides, meeting public demands for small denomination currency, SBP BSC offices also issued higher denominations
currency notes i.e. Rs.500 & above valuing Rs. 218 billion to the commercial banks and also advised them to ensure
uninterrupted operation of their ATM machines during Eid holidays.

SBP sees transformation of cash processing business to automation in next five years

 

Acting Governor State Bank of Pakistan Saeed Ahmad has said that the SBP sees total transformation of cash
processing business from manual to automation in next five years and thus would like to see commercial banks
aligning their plans with State Bank in this direction. “Without the joint action the desired results to improve the
quality of currency notes in circulation will not be achieved,” he said.

He was addressing participants of Conference on Currency Management: Strategies for the Future, organized by
State Bank of Pakistan at a local hotel in Lahore today. The conference was also attended by the leading
international experts from Switzerland, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka besides renowned local experts.

The conference covered important topics like Banknote Printing in Pakistan, Currency Management Challenges,
Global Trends and Developments in Security Ink and Ink-Based Security Features, Evolution of Banknote Security
Features in Pakistan, Global Trends and Developments in Security, Paper/ Paper-based Security Features of
Banknotes and Pakistan’s Experience, Challenges Related to Automation of Cash Operations and Automation of
Banknote Processing.

Mr. Saeed Ahmad said that banknotes are face of a central bank and ensuring circulation of clean notes, removal of
soiled and counterfeit notes, and redistribution of fit notes in the system is amongst key responsibilities of the SBP.
He further added that all necessary steps are being taken to this effect. Anmed hoped that the deliberations and
recommendations coming out from this conference would enable State Bank to align its currency management
policies and strategies with international best practices.

“Being cognizant of this responsibility, SBP has been investing significant human and financial resources to take this
important function to higher level,” he said. He admitted that while SBP and Pakistan’s banking industry is largely at
par with international best practices and standards both in regulation and supervision and service delivery, however,
we are quite behind in modernizing and automating its currency management processes.

Saeed Ahmad elaborated that the SBP has been making extensive efforts to implement its clean notes policy for the
last 10 years but with limited success largely due to lack of automation in cash processing. “We have thus planned
fast track automation of currency management function both at the central bank and commercial banks level,” he
added. He also underscored the role of commercial banks in automation of their cash processing systems.

The Acting Governor elaborated that automation of cash processing at SBP is necessary but it could not be effective
in achieving its objective of ensuring adequate and uninterrupted supply of high quality and clean banknotes across
the country unless commercial banks also automate their cash processing systems.

It may be mentioned here that the State Bank is developing a documentary for educating the masses about the
security features of banknotes. Further, a smart phone application on Pakistani banknotes designs and security
features is also being developed for enhancing public awareness.

Earlier, Mr. Kazi Abdul Maktadir, Deputy Governor Operations, who is spearheading the exercise while elaborating
the challenges faced in currency management indicated that despite emergence of various alternatives to cash
based transaction in Pakistan, hard cash remains to maintain its predominant position. “We have witnessed a
significant surge in currency in circulation during the last five years, from 2009 to 2014, currency in circulation more
than doubled from Rs. 1,224 billion to Rs. 2,500 billion.” he said. Every year, on average, 1.9 billion pieces of currency
notes of various denominations are printed.

Adding further, he said that the other aspect of efficient currency management is combating currency
counterfeiting. “In collaboration with our security printing organizations a number of good quality features have

SBP issues Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector for July- September 2015

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 30""
September, 2015 released by SBP today highlighted that the year to date (Jan-Sep) profit
after tax of the banking sector recorded at PKR 148 billion, as against PKR 163 billion during
CY14. Return on Assets (ROA) before tax has increased to 2.6 percent in Sep-15 from 2.2
percent in Sep-14. However, the likely adjustment on account of provisions against infected
portfolio by the year end may keep a check on further growth in profits.

The Sep-15 quarter observed a marginal rise of 2.1 percent in the asset base of the banking
sector. Public sector demand for credit remained strong due to fiscal needs while private
sector advances witnessed nominal seasonal decline of 0.4 percent. Well aligned with the
domestic credit cycle, deposits also declined by 2.6 percent. Banks, therefore, relied more on
borrowings which grew by 38 percent during the quarter.

On the soundness of banking sector, the report added that the asset quality remained stable
as NPLs almost stayed unchanged at PKR 630 billion. However, the NPLs to Loans Ratio
(infection ratio) marginally increased from 12.4 percent in Jun-14 to 12.5 percent in Sep-15
on account of seasonal fall in advances. Net NPLs to net Loans ratio, however, declined to 2.5
percent from 2.7 percent in Jun-15 due to rise in accumulated provisioning against infected
loans. The solvency profile of the banking system further strengthened with Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) rising to 18.2 percent (17.2 percent as of Jun-15). Importantly, the
banking system is cushioned with high level of capital that may be utilized in any exigency.

The QPR for Sep-15 is placed at URL:

SBP amends its PRs for housing finance to allow financing to individuals for Solar Systems for
residential use

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has been extending its endeavors to enhance the housing financing in Pakistan
by creating an enabling regulatory environment through conducive Prudential Regulations (PRs) and
market development through issuance of guidelines, setting indicative targets and promoting capacity
building of financial institutions, etc.

Keeping in view current energy crises in Pakistan and to promote alternative energy solutions at
affordable finance, SBP amended its housing finance PRs to allow banks for extension of loans to
individuals for solar energy solutions for residential use as part of home loans. Previously, financial
institutions were extending finances for solar system under the head of personal loan for maximum
tenure of 5 years. However, after this amendment in Housing Finance PRs, banks/DFls can finance to
individuals for solar energy systems maximum upto ten years which will make financing affordable for
the borrower.

SBP believes that this facility will increase the use of solar energy solutions at household level and will
also increase housing finance in Pakistan. Outreach of housing finance in Pakistan, in terms of income
groups and geography is very limited.

Housing and construction plays an important role in an economy. Around 50 industries and 70 percent of
the unskilled labour are associated with construction sector. Housing finance supplements radically in
long-term economic growth via job creation, economic linkages and in raising living standards of people.

facilitating the general public in acquiring fresh currency notes on the eve of forthcoming Eid-ul-Fitr.

These fresh notes will be available from nominated commercial bank branches called “e-branches”.

The issuance to the general public through Mobile SMS service will commence from July 8, 2015.

Under this facility, a person will be required to send an SMS message comprising his/her CNIC/Smart
Card number along with desired bank branch code [e.g. CNIC Number (space) branch code] to 8877.
The branch reference codes of nominated e-branches are available at SBP website www.sbp.org.pk
and PBA website www.pakistanbanks.org In return, the person will get SMS containing his transaction
code, branch address and transaction validity date. This transaction code will be valid for a maximum
of two working days. The person will approach concerned bank branch along with his original

CNIC/Smart Card and short code received from 8877 and get the defined quota of fresh notes.

It may be mentioned here that the quota of fresh notes to be issued comprises of one packet each of
Rs.10/-, Rs.20/-, Rs.50/- with an optional packet of Rs. 100/- as per availability of stock with the
concerned branch. It is also notified that a person can get fresh notes quota only once from his mobile

SBP-FAO seminar on agriculture value chain financing
held for senior bankers

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in collaboration with Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
of the United Nations organized a seminar on “Agricultural Value Chain Financing’ here on
Monday. Two well-known international experts, Mr. Calvin Miller from FAO, and Dr. Prasun
Das from Asia-Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA) shared globally
best practices of various value chain financing models.

The inaugural session was chaired by Syed Samar Hasnain, Executive Director, State Bank
of Pakistan. The seminar was attended by around 100 participants largely including senior
executives of commercial banks, and officials of State Bank. While addressing the audience,
Mr. Hasnain highlighted SBP’s strategy of working closely with the banking and agriculture
sectors for meeting the growing demand of agri-credit in the country. He appreciated the
efforts of the banks which have already achieved 58% of the annual target of Rs. 500 billion
for agri-credit disbursements in the first eight months of current fiscal year 2014-15.

Mr. Hasnain also stressed that the banks needed to explore financing to all clusters of
agriculture with particular focus on reaching out to small farmers. He encouraged the banks
to use innovative credit methodologies such as value chain financing to reach out to small
farmers. Referring to the importance of value chain financing, he said that SBP has been
working to create an ecosystem for supporting such innovative models. He mentioned about
SBP’s support to the pilots of few banks in financing to value chains of sugarcane, potato,
and aqua-culture.

FAO representative Mr. Nasar Hayat highlighted the efforts and assistance that FAO has
been extending to the Government in building and strengthening the national agriculture
infrastructure in Pakistan. He emphasized on the need of an inclusive and efficient
agricultural and food system. In particular, he shared the FAO’s activities to support small
farmers of Baluchistan to improve their production yield and market access.

At this occasion, two Pakistani leading banks HBL and Khushhali Bank, and one major food
industry player, Engro Foods also shared their experiences of working with the emerging
value chains in Pakistan.

In his concluding remarks, Dr. Saeed Ahmed, Director of the Agricultural Credit &

Microfinance Department of SBP appreciated the FAO collaboration with SBP for promoting
agricultural value chain financing in Pakistan.

SBP issues prepaid card regulations

In order to promote electronic payments in Pakistan by introducing alternate digital means of
payments and achieve greater financial inclusion by taking advantage of the technological
developments in the card industry, SBP has issued Prepaid Card Regulations.

Prepaid Card is a payment instrument built around a pay early, spend later model rather than
the pay now and pay later models used in debit and credit cards respectively. Prepaid Cards
are considered ideal for giving unbanked segments of the population a flavor of formal
financial products without the need of opening a formal banking account. Prepaid cards are
being promoted as an alternative to a transaction banking account as its features resemble to
those offered in transaction banking accounts. As a result, Prepaid Cards are considered to
play an important role for enabling financial inclusion targeting not only at lower-income
unbanked individuals but also conventional consumers of traditional banking services.

Prepaid Card customers may withdraw cash and transfer funds from ATMs, pay exam fee,
shop online and travel abroad without requiring or compromising the debit/credit card, thus
limiting the risk associated with the payment cards usage.

These regulations have been developed in line with the international recommendations such
as those issued by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to minimize the AML/CFT risks
associated with the prepaid cards by covering relevant aspects such as issuance of Prepaid
Cards, permissible load limits, restriction on use, dispute resolution and consumer protection
besides covering other operational areas. Further in order to promote card usage in the
domestic market, financial institutions are allowed to offer prepaid cards through Authorised
Agents.

These regulations will enable banks in Pakistan to develop the prepaid cards market in the
country in order to provide more payment options to the unbanked population, while at the
same time take steps to ensure safety, security and customer protection as per international

standards.

Lifting of UNSC Sanctions against Iran

In line with the Federal Government’s decision to implement the United Nations Security Council
(UNSC) Resolution 2231 (2015) dated July 20, 2015 regarding lifting of sanctions against Iran, the
State Bank of Pakistan has communicated to banks/Fls that previous sanctions on Iran have been
removed and normal business activities can be commenced within the scope of the Resolution.
Banks/Fls have been advised to remain mindful about the activities and persons which continue to

remain on the UNSC list, as well as the currencies or financial systems which are subject to certain
restrictions.

It is expected that the lifting of sanctions and restoration of banking channels between Pakistan and
Iran would revive normal trade and business activities between the two neighbors.

Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector for the quarter
ended 30"" June,2016

th

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 30
June, 2016, has been released by SBP. The report highlights that the asset base of the banking
sector has registered an increase of 7.7 percent.

The reviewed quarter is marked with significant rise in advances by 7.6 percent led by growth
in advances to private sector and financing for commodity operations. Private sector advances
grew by 4.0 percent over June, 2016 quarter as compared to 2.1 percent in corresponding
period of last year. Despite seasonal net retirements in textile and sugar sectors, strong
financing demand from several manufacturing sectors (e.g. production and transmission of
energy, chemical and pharmaceutical, individuals) has resulted in overall healthy growth in
advances.

Asset quality has declined slightly during Apr-Jun, 2016 due to rise in Non-Performing Loans.
However, proportionally larger growth in advances has pushed down NPLs to Loan ratio to
11.1 percent as of end June, 2016 from 11.7 percent as of end March, 2016.

Investments grew by 4.9 percent with most of it going into Government papers. This
continuing increase in investment in Government securities has further strengthened already
comfortable liquidity position of the banking system.

The deposit base, which grew by 6.8 percent and mainly provided for the funding needs of the
system, observed some deceleration, due to multiple factors including declining return on
deposits, shift in depositors’ preference to alternative modes of savings (e.g. prize bonds,
capital market etc), imposition of withholding tax etc. Banks met the balance of the funding
needs through financial borrowing.

Profit after tax for the first half of CY16 has narrowed by 5.4 percent to PKR 93.7 billion over
the corresponding period of last year, largely due to decline in interest rates.. Further, rising
cost to income ratio owing to infrastructure expansion, hiring of human resource, IT related
investment etc also has hit the profitability of the banking sector. Solvency of the system has
remained strong with Capital Adequacy ratio (CAR) of 16.1 percent staying well above the
minimum local and international benchmarks.

Governor SBP sees enhanced cooperation among SAARC Countries for
developing Correspondent Banking Framework in the region

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has emphasized the importance
of enhanced cooperation among the central banks to develop regional correspondent banking channels
for facilitating the trade and flow of remittances in the region.

He was addressing to the inaugural session on the seminar on “Payment Systems and
Correspondent Banking in the SAARC Region” organized by SBP under the auspices of SAARCFINANCE on
Monday at National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) Islamabad. The seminar was attended by
participants from central banks of SAARC countries. Local and foreign experts on the subject shared their
views on different dimensions of correspondent banking.

The SBP Governor emphasized that there is a need for strengthening payment and settlement
mechanisms. He said that the regulators of SAARC region need to interact, coordinate and discuss
Payment Systems issues in order to find common solutions to address the challenges that are being
faced in this domain with the objective of facilitating trade, commerce and remittance flows. He was of
the view that the cost and time of monetary transactions can be reduced significantly if SAARC countries
are able to develop their own corresponding banking system. He also made it clear that the regional
countries cannot afford to ignore the risks and responsibilities relating to money laundering that are
increasingly being faced by financial institutions in today’s world.

It may be mentioned here that this was the first ever Seminar on Correspondent Banking and
Payment Systems at the SAARC level aimed at providing the regional central banks an opportunity to

share policies and practices prevalent in their respective jurisdictions, and explore new areas of
cooperation.

Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector- March 2016

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 31°
March, 2016, released by SBP today, highlighted that the asset base of the banking sector has
registered an increase of 1.0 percent.

This growth was mainly contributed by banks’ investment in government securities (mostly
Pakistan Investment Bonds) as overall advances observed seasonal decline owing to net
retirements against commodity financing and Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) financing.
However, the seasonal contraction in gross advances (0.6 percent) was lesser than the
average decline of 1.2 percent during the same quarter of last two years due to positive
growth in advances to private sector (1.0 percent) — mainly fixed investment advances.

The deposits — sensitive to seasonal fall in overall advances — slightly declined by 0.6 percent
during Mar-16 with dip in current deposits and fixed deposits; however, saving deposits
increased by 3.6 percent. Consequently, the borrowings from financial institutions (mostly
SBP) provided the funding necessary for asset expansion.

Asset quality slightly declined during Mar-16; NPLs to Loan ratio (infection ratio) increased by
32 bps to reach 11.7 percent and Net NPLs to Net Loan ratio inched up by 23 bps to 2.1
percent. Banks’ growing share in government securities further improved the fund based
liquidity; though, some volatility was seen in market liquidity.

With Year on Year (YoY) growth of 2.1 percent, Mar-16 quarter observed profit after tax of
PKR 52.9 billion (profit before tax: PKR 81.6 billion). However, due to slowdown in pace of
profits, Net Interest Margin (NIM) narrowed down to 3.9 percent in Mar-16 (4.4 percent in
Mar-15) and ROA to 2.3 percent (2.6 percent in Mar-15). Solvency observed downward
adjustment to 16.3 percent in Mar-16 (17.4 percent in Mar-15), still well above the minimum
local required threshold of 10.25 percent and international benchmark of 8.625 percent,
primarily due to one-off accounting adjustment by a public sector bank, continued growth in
private sector advances and dividend payments by profitable banks.

The banking sector growth was reflected through absorption of new human resources and
expansion in banking infrastructure including ATMs and branches.

RCG Asia meeting--Governor SBP for enhancing cooperation to mitigate cyber threats

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra emphasized the importance of
financial technology and cyber security in an increasingly technology dependent world during his
opening address to the members of Regional Consultative Group Asia (RCG Asia). He reiterated FSB’s
stance that the RCG Asia should expand cooperation and enhance active monitoring of financial
technology developments to mitigate potential cyber risks while allowing financial technology to
thrive.

He was co-chairing the 10™ meeting of Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for
Asia (RCG Asia) alongside Mr. Norman T.L. Chan of Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The meeting was
held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia today on May 27, 2016.

In July 2015, Governor Wathra was appointed as the co-chair of FSB-RCG Asia along with Mr. Norman
T.L. Chan of Hong Kong Monetary Authority for a two-year term. The co-chairs are responsible for
hosting RCG Asia meetings, conducting workshops, coordinating with the FSB Secretariat, and
attending FSB Plenary meetings.

FSB has been established to coordinate, at international level, the work of national financial
authorities and international standard setting bodies and to develop and promote the
implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest
of financial stability. In addition to its own member countries, FSB, through six regional consultative
groups (RCGs), conducts outreach with around 65 other non-FSB member jurisdictions. Formed in
2011, the RCG Asia includes central banks and financial authorities of 16 jurisdictions.

During the welcoming remarks, the Governor also commented on sessions pertaining to recent FSB
activities and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) second consultative document on
revised standardized approach for credit risk within the BCBS capital framework.

During the meeting, the RCG Asia members discussed issues pertaining to vulnerabilities and financial
stability, such as divergent monetary policies adopted by various jurisdictions and the persistently low
commodity prices, and their potential impact for the region. Further, they discussed corporate
governance focusing on how a robust governance framework will support better allocation of
authority and responsibilities for the board and senior management, monitoring of performance, and
improvements in employees’ conduct within a financial institution. Further, meeting participants
deliberated upon the outcomes of the 19 May RCG Asia workshop on fintech and cyber security,
which was co-chaired by Mr. Muhammad Javaid Ismail of SBP and Mr. Shu-pui Li of HKMA in Hong
Kong.

The meeting concluded with a session on Implementation of effective resolution regimes where
members shared their experiences and challenges in implementing the resolution regime. Members
also discussed ways to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the event of resolution actions.

FSB has issued a detailed press release about the proceedings of the 10 meeting, which can be

Reclassification of Islamic Financing & Related Asset in Monetary and Credit Data

The State Bank of Pakistan, through a circular in 2013 advised banks that all financings,
advances (against murabaha etc.), inventories and any other related item(s) pertaining to
Islamic modes of financing classified under ‘Other Assets’ would be part of the ‘Islamic
Financing and Related Assets’ in scheduled banks annual, half-yearly and quarterly financial
statements w.e.f. December 31, 2012. In order to streamline the monetary and credit data
with the revised definition, the Islamic financing and related assets previously classified
under ‘Other Assets’ has been reclassified under credit/advances in all statistical statements
of advances and monetary statistics. Accordingly, the weekly data of monetary aggregates

and weekly profile of broad money have been revised.

All monthly data relating to monetary & credit published through SBP website and other

publications will also be revised since January 2013.

The revised table on Weekly Profile of Broad Money (M2) can be seen on SBP website at:

Monetary Policy Statement
November 24, 2017

The latest information reveals that economic activity is strong as corroborated by broad-based pick up in
industrial output, gains in factors supporting production of major crops, and growth in private sector
credit. This implies that the prospects of achieving 6.0 percent target of real GDP growth continue to be
strong. Model-based projections for inflation and survey-based measures of inflation expectations show
that in FY18 overall inflation is expected to remain well below the target of 6.0 percent. On the fiscal
front, healthy growth in tax revenue collection by FBR during Q1-FY18, 22.0 percent compared to the
modest 4.5 percent during Q1-FY17, is a welcome development. Neat-term balance-of-payments
challenges continue to persist. However, visible improvements in export growth, notable increase in
foreign direct investments and expected other financial inflows will help contain these pressures.

A review of latest developments in the real sector show that during Q1-FY18 LSM growth has surpassed
its eatlier expectations as it has been recorded at 8.4 percent compared to 1.8 percent in the
corresponding period of FY17. This is explained by improved security conditions and power supply,
transformation of fixed investment into enhancements of productive capacity on the ground, low
inflation and stable interest rates. Further support comes from the continuation of CPEC projects.
Barring any extreme seasonal events, agriculture sector is expected to perform better for the second
consecutive year. This is explained by increase in both cultivated area and fertilizer off-take during the
Kharif season, on-going trend of investment in mechanization, higher uptick in agricultural credit and
unchanged support price for wheat at the time of its sowing. Accordingly, demand for services is also
expected to rise in FY18 given its inter-connectivity with the other two sectors. Taking all the evidence
together, real GDP growth is expected to meet its target level of FY18.

Turning to inflation, CPI inflation averaged 3.5 percent during Jul-Oct FY18 - well below the annual
inflation target. Higher international oil prices along with pass-through to domestic petroleum prices and
the imposition of regulatory duty on non-essential import items ate expected to increase inflation in the
coming months. However, while taking into account these effects, inflation is still expected to fall inside
the range of 4.5-5.5 percent projected at the start of FY18. Indeed, supply side dynamics, both for food
and non-food items, are improving given the gains in agricultural yields and investment in
manufacturing. The current growth momentum is being translated into upward pressure in the services
component of the CPI basket. Consequently, NFNE measure of core inflation remains relatively high
although stable around its current level of 5.3 percent (YoY) since November FY17.

An important development in the monetary sector is a visible change in the pattern of government
borrowing for budgetary financing. Instead of relying heavily on Central Bank financing like last year,
Government is securing funds both from SBP and scheduled banks. Alongside active liquidity
management by the Central Bank kept the overnight repo rate close to the policy rate and is supporting
the availability of credit. Indeed, the stock of credit to the private sector grew on YoY basis by Rs. 814.9
billion in October FY18 (a growth of 18.5 percent) as compated to Rs. 436.4 billion (11.0 percent
growth) in the corresponding period last year. Looking into the break-up of this credit expansion, the
already buoyant growth in fixed investment gained further traction at a slightly higher level relative to
FY17, while both working capital loans and consumer financing showed encouraging trends. These
developments are further supported by the improvement in capacity utilization of major sectors which
indicates growing demand.

SBP corrects misreported facts

Apropos the news stories covering the visit of Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industries
by Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Ashraf Mahmood Wathra and SBP team some of the
facts mentioned during the Q&A session have been incorrectly reported. To keep the record
straight and avoid any misunderstanding, it is clarified that following facts were mentioned
during the meeting.

To a question comparing low credit to GDP ratio in the country with other countries and
attributing it to government borrowing SBP responded by saying that one reason for low credit
to GDP ratio is the presence of a large informal sector of the economy. Private sector credit is
already on rise and this could improve further with a higher tax to GDP ratio as higher tax
revenues would reduce government's borrowing needs.

During the speech of the Governor, numbers relating to major macroeconomic indicators,
including workers' remittances, were also shown in a slide. According to the slide, workers'
remittances stood at US$19.9 billion at the end of FY16, which grew by 11 percent during
2009-13. The news stories have reported 19.9 as the percent growth in workers’ remittances
during FY 16 which is not correct.

SBP Issues Draft Framework on IT Governance & Risk Management for Financial
Institutions

 

State Bank of Pakistan has issued draft Framework on IT Governance & Risk Management for
Financial Institutions for comments/feedback from interested parties. The draft framework is
available on SBP’s website www.sbp.org.pk.

The framework is based on international standards and recognized principles of international
practice for technology governance and risk management and shall serve as SBP's baseline
requirement for all Financial Institutions (Fls). It aims to provide enabling regulatory environment
for managing risks associated with use of technology.

The framework will apply to all Fls which includes commercial banks (public and private sector
banks), Islamic banks, Development Finance Institutions (DFls), and Microfinance Banks
(MFBs). The framework is not ""one-size-fits-all"" and implementation of the same shall be risk-
based and commensurate with size, nature and types of products and services and complexity
of IT operations of the individual Fls.

The instructions are focused on enhancing the proactive and reactive environments in Fls to
various facets and dimensions of the information technology, security, operations, audit and
related domains and to create overall safe and secure technology operations in Fls which will
benefit and enhance the confidence of all the stakeholders. The Fis are expected to assess and
conduct a gap analysis between their current status and the guidelines and draw a time-bound
action plan to address the gaps and comply with the guidelines.

SBP invites the interested parties, institutions or individuals, from banking sector, IT industry,
academia and other stakeholders to review the proposed draft framework and provide
comments/feedback, if any, at the following email address: EITGF@sbp.org.pk

Deputy Governor SBP lauds improvement in security conditions

and its positive impact on economic activities

Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Jameel Ahmad while appreciating the reviving economic
activities in the country has lauded the impact of improved security conditions, attributed much to
the operation Zarb-e-Azb, and the on-going operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. “A marked turnaround in retail
sales has been observed in metropolises, with positive readings in investor and consumer confidence
surveys,” said the Deputy Governor.

He was addressing to a delegation of National Security and War Course 2017 led by Air Commodore
Aamir Bashir that visited State Bank of Pakistan. The delegation consisted of more than 200 officers
including Pakistan Armed Forces officers, Grade 20 CSS officers and senior military officers from
friendly countries.

Deputy Governor SBP Jameel Ahmad further stated that their inland study tour of SBP will offer them
an insight into working of Pakistan's central bank and understanding of monetary policy issues. The
keynote address of the Deputy Governor traversed many themes. Deputy Governor explained that
being the central bank of a developing country, State Bank of Pakistan has also assigned for itself an
important developmental role. Given the socio-economic indicators of the country, coupled with low
level of financial inclusion, SBP has been aggressively promoting financing to under-served sectors of
the economy like farmers; micro, small and medium enterprises; and also faith-sensitive clients who
do not intend to bank with conventional institutions.

Dr. Omar Farooq Saqib, Director, Economic Policy Review Department, SBP delivered a detailed
presentation on SBP Functions and Monetary Policy. He outlined the functions of the SBP; Monetary
Policy; and Current Economic Conditions and Policy Challenges. He also responded to the queries of
the audience.

It may be recalled here that a delegation of National Security and War Course 2016 had also visited
State Bank of Pakistan in November, 2016.

In the end, Air Commodore Aamir Bashir thanked the Deputy Governor for providing the opportunity
of great learning to the course participants.

SBP enhances Quarterly Compendium; provides detailed coverage on
performance and soundness of MFBs

In order to provide relevant and up to date information to the stakeholders about the state of the
affairs of the Banking System, State Bank of Pakistan(SBP) regularly publishes banking statistics
in the form of Quarterly Compendium (QC) on its website. The QC provides financial data as well
as information on key Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Banking System, Islamic Banking

(IB) and Development Financial Institutions(DFIs).

Considering the growing importance of financial inclusion and role of Microfinance Banks
(MFBs) therein, it has been decided to start publishing comprehensive data of MFBs in the QC
starting from third quarter of 2017(Q3CY17) onwards. Earlier some broad numbers on MFBs
have been published by SBP as part of its publications including “Development Finance Reviews”
and “Financial Stability Review”. The enhanced QC provides detailed information on
performance and Financial Soundness of MFBs, in addition to coverage of Banking System, IBs
and DFlIs. The QC also covers quarterly time series data of MFBs from fourth Quarter of
2008(Q4CY08) onwards.

The enhanced QC is available at URL: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/fsi.asp.

The financial sector remains in a sound
and stable state, says the SBP’s Financial Stability Review for CY16

 

The State Bank of Pakistan issued today its annual publication viz., Financial Stability Review
(FSR). The Review presents an analytical assessment of the financial sector during CY16, its
associated risks and resilience analysis of the banking sector.

The FSR concludes that the financial sector of Pakistan remains in a sound and stable state at
the end of CY16. The performance of both the financial and non-financial sectors has improved
the risk profile of the system as a whole, as the risks to the financial system remained subdued
but are actually reducing. However, some emerging low to moderate level risks in the short to
medium term need attention and are being closely monitored by SBP.

The financial sector has operated in a relatively challenging global environment in CY16. The
review highlights some global concerns such as low world economic growth, especially slow
growth in advanced economies and oil-price induced economic shocks in the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries (the major export destinations and source of remittances flows for
Pakistan); international trade slowdown; rising protectionist sentiments and the policy
normalization in the US which might lead to tighter financial conditions in the Emerging
Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Going forward, it recommends that these
developments warrant policymaker’s attention.

The Review suggests that the domestic macrofinancial environment has been conducive in
CY16: Output (both GDP and LSM) has been increasing; inflation remains subdued; exchange
rate is stable amid adequate reserves; government borrowing from banking sector has receded,
law and order conditions have improved and economic prospects are encouraging, more so, in
view of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Not surprisingly, performance of the banking
sector has been satisfactory and financial markets, in general, have performed smoothly. In
addition, the corporate sector has also benefited from the favorable macrofinancial conditions
and has posted robust profits.

Banking sector — which accounts for around three-fourth of the financial sector — has

performed well. Encouragingly, the growth momentum of advances has picked up further, with
private sector as the main beneficiary, while asset quality has improved with a decline in
infection ratios. Specifically, gross advances have increased by 12.81 percent in CY16 compared

SBP acquires Pakistan Security Printing Corporation

The State Bank of Pakistan has acquired the banknotes and prize bonds printing functions of
Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) from the Federal Government. The other security
printing functions of PSPC including printing of passports, National ID Cards, stamp papers etc
have been separated and vested in National Security Printing Company (Private) Limited (NSPC), a
newly established company fully owned by the Federal Government.

The SBP being the sole issuer of banknotes in the country gives utmost importance to the integrity
and quality of banknotes. In order to have full control over the process of banknotes
manufacturing and issuance, the SBP has been in negotiations with the Federal Government for
over two years to acquire the banknotes and prize bonds printing function of PSPC. This was in line
with the global and regional trends as a number of central banks including Central Bank of France,
Turkey, Italy, Australia, India and various other central banks have their own banknotes printing
facilities.

The Federal Government, while agreeing to the Bank’s proposal has separated the PSPC functions
into banknote and prize bond printing and other security printing (OSP) units. The OSP business
has been assigned to National Security Printing Company NSPC, whereas the remaining PSPC
having core function of banknotes and prize bond printing has been sold to SBP. The Bank has paid
a consideration of Rs 100.149 billion to the GoP during the month of June, 2017 for transfer of
ownership and control, based on the fair value as determined by an independent consultant
appointed for this purpose.

The SBP has since assumed control of the PSPC and deputed Mr. Muhammad Haroon Rasheed
Malik, Executive Director of the Bank, as Managing Director of the company. The SBP is committed
to run the PSPC as its fully owned subsidiary through an independent Board of Directors, in
accordance with corporate governance best practices.

Apropos the complaint received from Secretary to the Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq
and news items appearing in the media regarding issuance of Term Deposit Receipts (TDRs) worth
huge amounts in the name of certain parliamentarians (Chairman Senate, Mr. Raza Rabbani, Leader
of Opposition in the National Assembly, Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah, Leader of Opposition in the
Senate Ch. Aitzaz Ahsan and Member National Assembly Maulana Fazal Ur Rehman) from SME Bank
and transactions in their accounts was investigated by the State Bank of Pakistan. Initial results reveal
that no such TDRs have been issued by the SME Bank nor any of these parliamentarians have any
deposit account with the said bank. It is clarified that the bank issues TDRs only for those of its
customers who already have a deposit account with the said bank. It appears that the TDRs have
been issued using counterfeit or stolen TDR Forms from the bank by some unscrupulous elements to
malign the Parliamentarians. Further investigations in the matter are underway and will be shared in
due course. The SME Bank is also taking up the matter with the relevant law enforcement agency for

further investigation.

Remittances by Authorized Dealers on behalf of Umrah Organizers

In order to facilitate the Umrah Organizers to meet the Umrah related expenses on account of Pakistani
pilgrims in Saudi Arabia such as accommodation, transportation etc., State Bank of Pakistan has allowed
Authorized Dealers to affect remittances on behalf of Umrah Organizers directly to vendors/services
providers in Saudi Arabia through banking channel.

Further, Authorized Dealers have also been allowed to affect advance remittances on behalf of Umrah
Organizers for making prior arrangements regarding the above mentioned services in Saudi Arabia.

The State Bank expects that while the above remittance mechanism would enable Umrah Organizers to
conduct their operations smoothly, it would also help in minimizing the possibility of funds transfer
through informal channels from Pakistan.

It may be recalled that earlier the State Bank had allowed Authorized Dealers to affect Hajj related
remittances on behalf of Hajj Group Organizers to Saudi Arabia through interbank market.

Monetary Policy Statement
May 20, 2017

Real GDP growth in FY17 is provisionally estimated at 5.3 percent representing a 10 year high.
Specifically, the revival of domestic demand has been instrumental in the current upturn. The major
thrust has come from the ongoing public and private investment particularly in infrastructure and
power sector. Furthermore, consumer spending has also expanded with a stable inflationary
environment and banks’ renewed interest in consumer financing. On the supply side, recovery in
major crops from last year, better energy supplies, and a broad based increase in Large-scale
Manufacturing have facilitated this expansion.

With further improvement in economic activity along with pass through of the recovering global oil
prices to domestic motor fuel cost, headline CPI inflation has also edged up in recent months. Going
forward in FY18, current trends of rising income, surge in imports, and accelerating credit to private
sector are expected to increase the CPI inflation; however, it is likely to remain within the target.

The upbeat economic sentiments and low interest rates have encouraged the private sector to
undertake capacity expansions. Private sector credit posted a net expansion of Rs 503 billion during
Jul-Apr FY17, which is significantly higher than the uptick of Rs 334 billion in the corresponding
period of last year. This was led by an increase in both the working capital and fixed investment
loans; whereas, consumer financing also maintained the uptrend seen in the past few months.
Notably, the credit flow to private businesses remained broad-based with major impetus from textile
& garments, chemicals, sugar, construction, and power sectors. In tandem with the expansion in the
economic activity, private sector credit uptake is expected to continue in FY18.

The supply of credit remained at ease because of the healthy growth in bank deposits and
government's reliance on central bank financing along with net retirement to commercial banks.
Also, calibrated open market operations by the SBP to manage residual liquidity demand played its
part, besides keeping the overnight repo rate generally close to the policy rate. Reflecting these
developments, money supply (M2) grew by 13.8 percent (YoY) in Apr FY17as compared to 13.0
percent (YoY) during the same month last year.

The expansion in economic activity has led to a concomitant surge in import payments during Jul-
Apr FY17. On the other hand, exports have posted only a marginal recovery; whereas, workers’
remittances also slowed down this year mainly owing to the changing labor market dynamics in the
GCC region. All these factors led to a sharp widening of the current account deficit during Jul-Apr
FY17, compared to the same period last year. As the financial inflows did not entirely cover the
current account imbalance, the overall balance of payments turned into deficit from a surplus in the
same period last year.

Going forward, official inflows are expected to provide support to foreign exchange reserves. A
sustained increase in other private inflows - foreign direct investments and export earnings in
particular - is required to fully finance the surge in imports. In this regard, accompanied with
expected improvements in global demand, the current composition of imports, mainly machinery,
bodes well for the future economic activities. Furthermore, the current growth momentum led by
CPEC related investments is likely to boost foreign direct investment inflows.

Keeping these factors in view, the Monetary Policy Committee of SBP has decided to keep the policy
rate unchanged at 5.75 percent.

The banking sector continues its steady expansion,
says the Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector

 

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for
the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (Q1CY17) on June 9, 2017. The document has highlighted that the
asset base of the banking sector has expanded due to rise in both the advances and investments
supported by marginal rise in deposits and increase in borrowings from financial institutions. The
profitability of the banking sector has moderated while the asset quality has improved and the capital
adequacy remains at satisfactory level.

Against the usual pattern of seasonal retirement of advances during first quarter of a calendar year,
Q1CY17 witnessed an uptick in private sector advances. Besides corporate sector’s borrowing for fixed
investments, a healthy growth in production of sugarcane led to higher levels of borrowing by both
public and private sectors under financing for sugar. The corporate sector, capitalizing on the low
interest rates and improved business environment, has been enhancing its longer-term exposures,
thereby strengthening the capital formation. Within consumer finance, auto and mortgage finance have
mainly contributed towards the growth of this sub-segment. Moreover, Islamic banking industry has
contributed significantly in growth in overall advances.

Deposits, the key funding source of the banking sector, have increased by 0.1 percent in Q1UCY17 in
contrast to 0.6 percent contraction in Q1CY16. Flow of funds have largely been seen in savings (PKR 54
billion), current account-remunerative (PKR 44 billion) and others categories. Apart from deposits,
borrowings from financial institutions provided the funding necessary for asset expansion.

Asset quality of the banking sector has improved with decline in non-performing loans ratio to 9.9
percent. This positive development has been brought about by a decline of 2.4 percent (YoY) in NPLs
and a strong growth of 15.5 percent (YoY) in advances. The infection ratio stands at its lowest level since
2009.

The banking sector has posted profit after tax of PKR 49 billion during Q1CY17 compared to PKR 52
billion in QL1CY16. This moderation in profits coupled with growth in assets narrowed down the ROA to
1.2 percent (1.5 percent as of end March, 2016).

Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has slightly adjusted downwards to 15.9 percent during Q1ICY17 mainly
due to continuing growth in private sector advances. Banks are well positioned from solvency
standpoint as the prevailing CAR is well above the minimum required level of 10.65 percent.

Governor Wathra directs Banks to improve regional and sectoral

allocation of agri. credit

Governor State Bank of Pakistan Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra has urged the banks to understand the
needs of the economy and focus on agri. financing as it is a viable business activity having huge cash
flows, and significant contribution in GDP with strong backward and forward linkages.

He was addressing the annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) which
was held under his chairmanship in Multan today. The meeting was attended by senior officers of
SBP, presidents and executives from commercial banks, specialized banks, microfinance banks &
Islamic banks, representatives of federal & provincial governments, and farmer chambers/
associations.

While delivering his keynote address, Mr. Wathra highlighted the active role played by the Central
Bank for promoting agri finance in the country. He emphasized that over the years State Bank of
Pakistan has adapted itself into the role of a facilitator and developmental partner of financial
institutions to accelerate the growth of agriculture finance in the country.

He further stressed that financial institutions need to strengthen their agricultural finance policies,
increase dedicated human resource, simplify lending procedures, rationalize lending rates, work
diligently for creating mass awareness, and develop other prerequisites for building lending portfolios
and timely provision of credit to farmers and harness untapped potential of agri. credit demand in the
country.

The keynote address was followed by a briefing wherein the performance of banks on key indicators
relevant to agricultural financing was reviewed. The briefing also covered important initiatives taken
by SBP to improving the access of financial services to marginalized farmers. The participants
deliberated on the way forward for credit enhancement in the underserved provinces/regions. The
ACAC members proposed, amongst other things, the need for collaboration of banks and government
departments for promotion of agri. credit, enhancement of agri. credit infrastructure in underserved
areas and development of Shariah compliant products and services for meeting the financial
requirements of faith sensitive clients.

The meeting was informed that during FY 2015-16, banks disbursed agricultural credit of Rs 598.3
billion which is nearly 100% of the overall annual target of Rs 600 billion and 16% higher than the
disbursement of Rs 515.9 billion made during FY 2014-15. Moreover, for FY 2016-17, during the first
six months (July-December, 2016) financial institutions have disbursed Rs 301.7 billion which is 43.1
percent of the indicative target of Rs 700 billion for the year.

The ACAC proposed the following key actions:
|. Allocation of geographical and sector wise targets and enhancement of agri. credit
infrastructure particularly in underserved area;
Il. Expediting the loan approval process by delegation of authority at branch/regional level;
IIL. Development/adoption of digital innovations to improve financial services of the small
farmers;
IV. Devise mechanism to provide wholesale lending products to microfinance Banks/Institutions
to strengthen outreach of small farmers;
V. Development of long term financing facility for the promotion of fruit orchards;

Economy continued to expand, posting a decade high real GDP growth of 5.3 percent

 

State Bank of Pakistan released its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for the fiscal year
2016-17 today. According to the Report, Pakistan’s economy continued to expand with real GDP
growing by 5.3 percent in FY17, the highest growth achieved during the last 10 years. A sharp recovery
in agriculture sector, healthy value addition in the services sector, and continued improvement in
manufacturing sector contributed to this broad based growth. From the demand side, the growth was
led by a surge in consumption followed by a moderate increase in investment.

The Report explains that the major impetus to economic activity came from an accommodative
monetary policy and consequent increase in private sector credit especially for fixed investment; tax
incentives for agriculture, exporting industries and investment; a steady increase in development
spending; and, continuing work on infrastructure and energy projects under CPEC. These factors led to
increase in domestic demand.

With the increase in domestic demand, imports also picked up pace. This, together with decline in
exports and remittances, resulted in current account deficit increasing to USS 12.1 billion in FY17
compared to USS 4.6 billion in FY16. The Report noted that higher official and private inflows helped to
partially finance the current account deficit.

While the Report recognizes that tax incentives and steady increase in development spending helped
economic activity, these led the fiscal deficit increasing to 5.8 percent of GDP in FY17 compared to 4.6
percent in FY16. Meanwhile, though inflation trended upward, it continued to be well anchored and
remained lower than the target for the third consecutive year in FY17. The average CPI inflation rose to
4.2 percent during FY17 after falling to 2.9 percent in FY16.

The Report also highlights the main challenges that need to be addressed to sustain the current pace of
expansion in the economy while keeping inflation low and stable going forward. It particularly
emphasizes on containing unnecessary imports and expanding export base in order to keep current
account deficit at manageable level. Moreover, to maintain the current pace of spending on
infrastructure and social development projects, the growth in revenue collection needs to be
accelerated. This can be achieved by deepening the reforms initiated at federal level and stepping up
efforts by provinces to enhance their own tax collection. The Report also suggests further improvement
in business conditions to strengthen recovery in investment and thus help switch away from current
consumption led to investment-cum-export oriented growth.

The SBP report also highlights the issue of growing water stress in the country amid erratic supply and
continuously increasing demand in the face of rising population, rapid urbanization and high wastage. It
further points out that quality of both the surface and ground water has deteriorated due to pollution
and excessive use of fertilizer and pesticides. It underscores the need for improvement in management
of water resources through minimizing losses and encouraging conservation to ensure smooth future
supplies for human consumption and its commercial use. The detailed Report is available at SBP website

Imports from Afghanistan against Registration of Contract
through Electronic Import Form

It may be recalled that all imports into Pakistan are required to be made compulsorily
through Electronic Import Form (EIF). The EIF was implemented with a view to curb the
illegal and duplicate payments of imports from Pakistan by unscrupulous elements.

In this regard, it was observed that due to peculiar nature of trade with Afghanistan through
land routes, especially via Torkham and Chaman borders, Pakistani importers were facing
difficulties to carry out import transactions through EIF.

In order to address these difficulties and to facilitate traders of the above regions, the
procedure for registration of contracts and payments thereagainst has been simplified. Now,
the requirement for routing of shipping documents against registered contract through
banks shall not be mandatory for imports from Afghanistan through land routes. The
Pakistani importers may now directly receive shipping documents from the Afghani exporters
and get the goods cleared after attachment of Goods Declaration(s) with EIF. Once the
importer gets the contract registered and EIF approved with the bank for multiple shipments,
the importers shall not be required to approach the bank again and again for approval of EIF.

The relaxation is expected to provide manifold benefits to the importers of above region by

reducing their cost of doing business and efficient processing of goods clearance at Customs
Stations bordering Afghanistan.

SBP Issues Framework for Risk Management
in Outsourcing Arrangement by Financial Institutions

 

State Bank of Pakistan has revised the ‘Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements’ with the
objective to enable Financial Institutions (Fls) including Banks, Microfinance Banks and
Development Finance Institutions to effectively manage the potential risks associated with
outsourcing arrangements. The revised instructions are termed as “Framework for Risk
Management in Outsourcing Arrangement by Financial Institutions”.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) earlier introduced the Guidelines on Outsourcing Arrangements for
banks/DFls in 2007. The Guidelines were issued in view of the increasing use of outsourcing of
services by banks/DFls and potential impact of associated risks and obligations to customers.

The framework is based on international standards and best practices on the subject. These
instructions aim to enhance the proactive environment in Fls on various aspects of the
outsourcing including but not limited to governance, risk management, insourcing of services,
group outsourcing, outsourcing of foreign branches of banks, information technology
outsourcing and collaboration/outsourcing arrangements by Fls with Fintechs (Financial
Technologies). Besides, the Framework also encompasses the list of critical functions/activities
that cannot be performed by employees of the 3rd party service providers.

All new outsourcing arrangements by Fls shall be governed under this framework. The Fls, while
deciding to outsource any function, activity or process, shall ensure that outsourcing neither
effects the protection available to depositors or investors under the existing legal framework
nor the same shall be used to avoid compliance with the regulatory requirements. The Fls are
required to ensure that their existing outsourcing arrangements would be aligned with this
framework latest by June 30, 2018.

unscrupulous element behind these attempts, SBP has already lodged a complaint with the FIA

Revised Instructions regarding Making and Dispatch of

Shipping Documents by the Exporters

In wake of changing global trade practices and to facilitate exporters, the State Bank has
relaxed its foreign exchange regulations allowing exporters to directly dispatch transport
documents to the buyers abroad against shipments valuing upto US Dollar 100,000/- or
equivalent. The authorized dealers (banks) have been advised to above effect vide F.E.
Circular No. 11 issued today by the State Bank.

The development is expected to provide manifold benefits to the local exporters including
reducing the cost of doing business, efficient processing of export documents and improving
competitiveness of Pakistani exports in the international market.

Earlier, the carriers (shipping companies, airlines, railways, etc.) were required to draw the transport
documents (bills of lading, airway bill, railway receipts, etc.) only to the order of an authorized dealer
for exports taking place from Pakistan and the same were required to be dispatched to the buyer
abroad through an authorized dealer.

SBP takes notice of skimming incidences—relevant
Bank to compensate fully its customers.

During the preceding week, State Bank of Pakistan noted with concern that customers’ information on
debit cards of Habib Bank Limited was compromised by hackers through skimming to create its clones
and were used to withdraw depositor’s money from various locations within and outside the country.
Since then SBP has been in contact with HBL management to ascertain the losses, returning of money
to the affected customers and precautionary measures to limit the impact of this hacking activity.

HBL has taken several immediate actions to determine and limit the impact of such transactions on
customers. Specifically, it blocked all identified debit cards that were suspected to be misused and
quarantined the Automated Teller Machines (ATM) used in hacking activity. Till today, 296 customers
have confirmed the disputed transactions and the estimated damage assessment done to the concerned
Bank is Rs10.2 million for their customers. HBL has also managed to start returning the money to
depositors to the extent of their losses. Meanwhile efforts are underway to determine losses to any
other bank’s customers using HBL ATMs and take remedial measures.

ATM skimming — an illegal activity in which account details are stolen from the magnetic strip
contained on the back of the debit card has been around for a while and such incidents have happened,
sporadically, in Pakistan as well. To safeguard the depositors from fraudulent transactions, SBP has
issued specific regulations for the security of payment cards and internet banking, under which banks
are required to develop and implement comprehensive framework for risk assessment, implementation
of controls and monitoring.

It would be pertinent to mention here that debit cards with a magnetic strip on its back — that stores
customer’s account details are particularly vulnerable to skimming and cloning. Debit cards,
complying with EMV (Europay Mastercard Visa) standards, featuring a chip and offering two factor
authentication are now considered most effective countermeasure for card cloning through skimming
globally. Accordingly, SBP vide its circular PSD 05 of 2016 issued regulations for Payment Cards
Security wherein banks are required to develop infrastructure for EMV Compliance and issue cards by
30th June 2018.

SBP reassures bank’s customers that complying with its responsibility of ensuring a smooth and safe
payment systems it will take every measure in coordination with banks to safeguard the interest of
depositors against any fraudulent activity.

SBP advises Banks against Discriminating Consumer Finance Practices

In continuation to its earlier instructions, State Bank of Pakistan has advised
banks/development finance institutions (DFls) to not discriminate any segment of the society
and follow SBP instructions issued earlier which required banks / DFls to desist from adopting
discriminatory practices on the basis of trade, region, gender, ethnicity, specific profession,
class and / or group of citizens e.g. lawyers, politicians, security officials and law enforcement
agencies etc.

State Bank has stressed banks/DFls in its circular issued today that Politically Exposed Persons
(PEPs) have time and again raised their concerns regarding adoption of discriminatory practices
by banks in providing consumer finance and general banking facilities. SBP has further asked
banks / DFls to explicitly convey reasons of refusal in writing to the applicant and keep a
separate file of all approved and rejected cases of PEPs.

Such practices are against the spirit of fundamental rights ordained by the Constitution of
Pakistan and regulatory instructions on the subject and that these complaints have been
viewed seriously at the central bank of the country.

SBP has further stated in the circular that any violation of the instructions will attract punitive
action under relevant provisions of Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962

Governor SBP takes stock of banking and development
finance issues during his visit to Quetta

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra spent a busy day in provincial
capital Quetta and held meetings with CEOs of commercial banks and representatives of Quetta
Chamber of Commerce & Industry (QCCI).

Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, in continuation of his earlier engagements with Banking
Industry and different Chambers of Commerce & Industry, invited the Chief Executive Officers
(CEOs), of all leading banks for a meeting on Mondayat Quetta.These engagements are aimed at
understanding, at firsthand, issues faced by industries of specific area; assessing the efficiency of
intermediary function performed by banks, and addressing the limitations encountered by banks
in effectively performing their intermediary function.

Governor, SBP advised banks to take steps, which interalia included the following items: All banks to
prepare at least three years business plan to strengthen their presence in Baluchistan; take concrete
steps to increase number of branchless banking agents, branchless banking accounts and ATMs in the
province; open branches in underserved districts of the province; increase the financing, particularly,
in the concessional finance schemes of SBP/GoP, and, maintain continued focus on AML/CFT risks.

The aforementioned steps have been identified to increase the footprint of banking industry in
the province of Baluchistan for achieving the SBP’s strategic goal (2020) of enhancing the
Financial Inclusion in country:

State Bank of Pakistan is cognizant of fact that private sector lending is picking up, on account of,
improved security situation and better availability of energy; however, a lot needs to be done,
particularly, in areas which have remained marginalized, to ensure that economic growth is
inclusive and its benefits are shared by all stakeholders.

Governor, SBP sensitized the CEOs of the banks on continued improvement in security situation
in Baluchistan, realization of projects under CPEC, development of Gwader Port and untapped
natural resources, which together offer tremendous opportunities for growth and employment.
Banks were advised to promote the concessional financing schemes offered by SBP/GoP and take
concrete steps to increase financing under these concessional schemes to the promising
businesses in Baluchistan.

Later in the day, Governor also met with the President, Vice Presidents, other office bearers and
members of Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI). During the meeting, the
Governor informed business community about SBP’s efforts in promoting microfinance, agri-
credit and SME financing in Baluchistan. “Earlier this morning, we have gathered
Presidents/CEOs of all banks in Quetta to express our resolve to facilitate Baluchistan business
community. I have urged them to take concrete steps to increase financing to priority sectors in
the province”, said Governor.

The Governor told that in the light of Agriculture Credit Advisory Committee’s recommendation,
specific targets are being allocated to the banks for underserved/underdeveloped areas. Like-

Monetary Policy Statement
January 28, 2017

The average inflation clocked in at 3.9 percent during the first half of the year, lower
than the earlier projections due to smooth supply of perishable items, stable exchange
rate, and government's absorption of the impact of higher international oil prices. The
current trends suggest that the actual inflation would be lower than the target rate of 6
percent in FY17.

Growing CPEC-related imports, decline in exports, absence of Coalition Support Fund,
and slowdown in remittances, pushed the current account deficit to USD 3.6 billion in
the first half of FY17, from USD 1.7 billion in the same period last year. This higher
deficit was financed by an increase in bilateral and multilateral funding along with pick
up in investment flows. Overall surplus in the balance of payments stands at USD 0.2
billion in the first half of the current year. Going forward, with the aforementioned risks
to the external sector, the need of financial inflows would grow further.

A sizeable net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and an increase
in bank deposits helped increase private sector credit. Benefiting from the historic low
interest rates, private businesses are actively borrowing from the banking sector for
upgrading and expanding their business processes. Private sector borrowed Rs 375
billion in first half of FY17 as compared to Rs 282.6 billion availed in the corresponding
period of last year. Loans for fixed investments increased by Rs 134.1 billion in the first
half of FY17 compared with an expansion of Rs 83.8 billion in the same period of last
year. Demand for consumer financing, especially for auto loans, also gathered pace
during the first half of the year.

Healthy credit expansion, along with higher production of Kharif crops, visible
improvements in energy supply, and upbeat business sentiments signal recuperating
real economic activities. Large-scale Manufacturing grew by 3.2 percent during the first
five months of the current fiscal year and further increase is expected on account of
growing infrastructure spending and recent policy support for export oriented sectors.

Based on an assessment of the above developments and after detailed deliberations, the
Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 5.75
percent.

The overall economic environment continues to remain
conducive for growth, the SBP Report says.

State Bank of Pakistan has today released its Second Quarterly Report for FY17 on the State of
Pakistan’s Economy. The Report says that the overall economic environment remains conducive for
growth, on the back of accommodative monetary policy, increase in development spending, and
CPEC-inspired activities.

The Report has also noted the improvements in investors’ confidence as reflected in an uptick in
private sector credit, especially for fixed investment purposes; foreign interests in Pakistani
companies; and increased production of consumer durables. Similarly, a surge in import of
machinery and raw materials also points to a robust industrial activity and buildup of future
productive capacity.

According to the Report, the growth in Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) recovered in Q2-FY17 with
increase in production of food, cement, steel, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and electronic
industries. The growth in agricultural sector is also expected to rebound on account of higher
production of cotton, sugarcane, and maize and increased prospects for wheat harvest close to last
year after rains in early February 2017.

The Report highlights that current account deficit has almost doubled compared to the last year. This
was due to a surge in growth-inducing imports along with non-realization of CSF and decline in
exports and remittances. On an encouraging note, the Report acknowledges that the foreign inflows
— FDI, loans, and Sukuk issuance — were little more than sufficient to finance higher current account
deficit. The Report, nevertheless, highlights the need to contain current account deficit to
manageable levels to sustain external sector stability.

The Report also notes that fiscal deficit has increased due to low revenue generation amid higher
development and security related spending. While the Report terms sustained increase in
development spending commendable, it also underscores the need to enhance revenue collection.

The Report shows that average CPI inflation has risen from 2.1 percent in H1-FY16 to 3.9 percent as in
H1-FY17 which reflects higher domestic demand and an increase in global commodity prices.
However, it highlights that on year-on-year basis, the CPI inflation has fluctuated in a narrow range
during this period.

Finally, the Report perceives the growth to maintain the upward trajectory while inflation to remain
below the target during FY17.

signed the letter in a ceremony held at the SECP’s head office in Islamabad.

The Council will provide a forum for deliberating issues related to systemic risk, particularly those
having cross market and stability implications. It will suggest possible arrangements for crisis
preparedness and come up with a coordinated response. The Council will comprise of top officials of
the two regulators; SBP will be represented by the Governor, a Deputy Governor, and an Executive
Director. SECP will be represented by the Chairman, a Commissioner, and an Executive Director.

The formation of the Council is aligned with international practices. Since the global financial crisis,
maintaining financial stability has emerged as a key objective for central banks, financial regulatory
authorities and respective governments. To keep pace with global developments and enhance focus
on promoting and ensuring financial stability, both SBP and SECP have joined hands for strengthening
financial system stability and managing systemic risk.

The SBP has identified strengthening of the financial stability regime as one of the key goals under the
“SBP Vision 2020”. Similarly, management of systemic risk has been set as a regulatory responsibility
of the SECP under the SECP Act 1997. The establishment of the Council will not only facilitate SBP and
SECP in achieving their statutory and strategic objectives but also further enhance their collaboration
for promoting the stability of the financial system in the country.

The Council is a significant step forward to bring Pakistan in line with developed countries in risk
management and to protect the integrity of our financial system.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 25, 2017

The inflation expectations in the current fiscal year continue to remain well anchored. This has been
largely due to the near-absence of any major supply side pressures. However, rising real incomes in a
low interest rate environment since FY14 are indicating signs of pick up in domestic demand, which is
broadly reflected in the core inflation measures. Going forward, improving consumer confidence, as
depicted by IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey of March 2017, indicates further increase in
consumer demand. Hence, barring any major cost shocks, domestic demand will define the underlying
trend of headline inflation in FY18.

The real economic activity continues to gather pace at the back of better agricultural output, increase in
key Large-scale Manufacturing sectors, and a healthy uptick in the credit to private sector. This
expansion is helped by a range of factors including low cost of inputs, upbeat economic sentiments,
improved energy supplies, and CPEC related investments. As a result, GDP growth is expected to
further improve in FY17.

Also, prudent monetary policy stance has translated well into low and stable market interest rates,
which incentivized private sector to borrow from commercial banks to finance their businesses and
investment activities. Accordingly, private sector credit increased by Rs 349 billion during Jul-Feb FY17
as compared to Rs 267 billion in the same period last year. Encouragingly, fixed investment category
led the rise in private sector businesses loans by posting Rs 159 billion uptick during this period,
compared to Rs 102 billion last year. Similarly, consumer financing continued the uptrend in the first
eight months of the current fiscal year. Improved interbank liquidity conditions also spurred the
growth in private sector credit. This was led by both net government retirement to commercial banks
and a decent increase in bank deposits compared to the withdrawals seen last year. Furthermore,
interbank liquidity was managed well with calibrated open market operations that kept the weighted
average overnight repo rate close to the policy rate.

The expansion in economic activity has also translated into significant increase in imports, which along
with lack of any sustained improvement in exports and a small decline in remittances has pushed the
current account deficit to US$ 5.5 billion during Jul-Feb FY17. While net financial flows remained
higher, these were not sufficient to finance the current account deficit.

However, accounting for positive impact of the recent policy measures to augment exports and check
non-essential imports, the current account deficit may be contained in the coming months. Also,
continuation of the financial inflows, CPEC related imports, and any major fluctuation in the global oil
price will determine the overall position of the external sector in FY18.

Keeping these factors in perspective, the Monetary Policy Committee of SBP has decided to keep the
policy rate unchanged at 5.75 percent.

Fresh Note Issuance on Eid-ul-Fitr 2017

The State Bank of Pakistan through sixteen field offices of its subsidiary SBP Banking
Services Corporation has provided fresh cash of various denominations aggregated to Rs. 342
billion as against Rs 237 billion issued during last Ramadan.

Of the total amount provided, commercial banks have been issued fresh notes of Rs.40 billion
of small denomination, up to Rs.100, as against Rs.22 billion issued last year. This amount
also includes Rs.25 billion issued through SMS service 8877 operated by SBP BSC through
1002 branches of commercial banks in 120 cities and its sixteen field offices in fifteen cities.
An overwhelming response has been received from public on this service through which more
than 1.5 million people obtained fresh notes comprising 3 packets of Rs10, one packet of
Rs.50 and one packet of Rs100. Last year, Rs.16 billion was issued through this system.

In addition to issuance from over the counters commercial banks have been advised to ensure
that fresh notes are supplied to their ATMs during Ramzan in general and the long weekend in
particular. Special teams of SBP and SBP BSC officials have also be deputed to inspect and
monitor the working of ATMs across Pakistan during Eid holidays.

The amount includes fresh notes of higher denomination, Rs500 and above, amounting to
Rs.296 billion vis-a-vis Rs 211 billion issued during last year.

Economy maintains its growth momentum, says SBP report

 

The growth in real GDP remained at its upward trajectory, and increased to a decade-high of
5.3 percent in FY17, noted by State Bank of Pakistan’s third quarterly report on the State of
Pakistan’s Economy released today. Economic indicators like private sector credit and
investment also posted encouraging picture, whereas inflation remained below the target.

The Report also highlighted the revival in the agriculture sector during FY17, which was
supported by favorable policy measures, including subsidy on fertilizer, reduction in sales tax on
tractors, and increased access to finance. Better agriculture had, in turn, positive spillover for
trade and manufacturing sectors, argued by the Report. Further, PSDP and CPEC-related
activities also continued to boost construction related industries.

The overall improvement in business sentiments along with supportive policies (historic low
interest rate, high infrastructure spending and better law and order) has encouraged a number
of firms to pursue expansion plans, as observed by the SBP Report. This was reflected in a
significant surge in private sector credit off-take during FY17, with a sizable share of fixed
investment loans. At the same time, an increase in machinery imports was also noted.

The Report also mentions the decline in exports and worker remittances, which along with the
increase in imports led to a higher current account deficit as compared to the last year. On the
financing side, the official external inflows in Jul-Mar FY17 stood around the same level as last
year, while both FDI and FPI inflows increased. Although SBP’s FX reserves declined during this
period, these are sufficient to comfortably finance more than four months of imports.

Regarding fiscal situation, the Report observes an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.9 percent of
GDP during Jul-Mar FY17. The expenditure side of the fiscal operations remained well-managed
with a contained growth in current expenditure and a robust growth of about 15 percent in the
development expenditures. However, growth in tax revenues remained less than the target.

The Report also underscores the importance of sustainable levels of current and fiscal accounts
in order to maintain the prevailing growth momentum, and hard-earned economic stabilization.

Edhi commemorative coin unveiled at the State Bank of Pakistan

A Rs5O coin was unveiled at the State Bank of Pakistan Friday, 31° March, 2017 to commemorate the
services of late Abdus Sattar Edhi. Faisal Edhi, son of Abdus Sattar Edhi, was also present on the
occasion. Governor State Bank Mr. Ashraf Mahmood Wathra presented the commemorative coin to
Faisal Edhi.

Governor SBP paid tribute to the late Abdul Sattar Edhi. He informed the audience that Pakistan had
issued only five commemorative coins highlighting personalities including Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad
Ali Jinnah, Shair-e-Mashrique Allama Muhammed Iqbal, Madar-e-Millat Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah,
Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed, and now Abdus Sattar Edhi. Edhi is the only social worker who
has been honored with a commemorative coin, he said. He said that in July 2016, the State Bank had
organized a condolence gathering to pay homage to Edhi, where the commemorative coin
announcement was made. On the recommendation of the State Bank, the Prime Minister had
decided to issue a coin to commemorate Edhi’s services at national level. The wide scope of Edhi
Foundation’s services reflects the late philanthropist’s deep insight into various social issues, he said,
adding that in rendering his services Edhi made no distinctions of geographical limits, color, race,
nationality and religion. The best way to pay tribute to Edhi Sahib is to espouse his cause and
cooperate in all philanthropic activities.

Mr. Faisal Edhi thanked the SBP and the Government of Pakistan for issuing the coin commemorating
Edhi’s services to the humanity. He said that Abdus Sattar Edhi would remain alive in the hearts of the
nation, his mission should continue forever for the benefit of people.

The ceremony began with Mr. Abid Qamar, Chief Spokesperson of the SBP, welcoming the
participants. Mr. Qamar told the audience that issuance of commemorative coins started on the
birth centenary of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah when three coins were issued. Twenty-seven
coins commemorating various personalities and occasion have been issued, including 100 and 150""
anniversaries of Islamia College Peshawar and Lawrence College. He informed the audience that
commemorative coins would be available from today at SBP field offices throughout the country.

The ceremony was attended by Deputy Governor Mr. Riaz Riazuddin, Managing Director SBP BSC Mr.
Qasim Nawaz, other senior officers of the Bank and Edhi Foundation volunteers.

Governor, SBP meets with Presidents / CEOs of Commercial Banks

Mr. Tariq Bajwa, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan presided his first meeting with the
Presidents/Chief Executive Officers of all commercial banks today at SBP, Karachi. The Governor
welcomed and thanked the representatives of banks for their participation in the meeting. In his
opening remarks, the Governor shared the vision of a regulatory body being ‘Fair’ and ‘Firm’ with
the regulated entities and communicated that these two themes would be the guiding principles
for future interactions with the banking industry.

Adding further, the Governor shared his priority areas of promoting agricultural financing,
facilitating SMEs’ in their access to financial services and enhanced focus on addressing the
disparities emanating due to limited financial intermediary role and very small footprint of the
banking industry in the province of Balochistan. The Governor emphasized upon the banking
sector to proactively play their due role for achievement of these objectives for the greater goal
of inclusive economic growth and employment generation. He further stated that with the
country’s available natural resources coupled with support from the banking sector in the shape
of adequate and targeted financing to small farmers, the agriculture sector offers tremendous
opportunities for achieving higher economic growth. He further observed that SME’s are the
backbone of the industrial sector. In Pakistan this is a neglected sector and the SBP along with
the commercial banks need to proactively work for the development of the SMEs. He also
showed his commitment to promote Islamic banking by committing to make efforts for resolving
the industry’s major issues including issuance of Government Sukuk for its liquidity
management.

Other issues discussed in meeting included rescheduling / restructuring of non-performing loans
of textile industry, facilitation to retail customers in provision of foreign exchange services at
banks’ branches, adoption of PayPak Cards, rationalization of banks’ charges related to Inter-
bank fund transfer facility, Cyber Security and Export / Import of foreign currency notes.

The CEOs / Presidents of banks congratulated the Governor on his appointment and committed
to work with SBP in the priority areas. They shared their views with the Governor on overall
economic situation; opportunities available and challenges faced by the banking industry and
further stated that they were looking forward to the cooperation of SBP and Federal Government
for resolution of those challenges.

In his concluding remarks, the Governor reiterated that SBP would continue its engagements
with banks on regular basis to identify, communicate and resolve challenges on priority basis

Broad based and robust growth witnessed in advances
to private sector, says QPR of the Banking Sector

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 30th
June, 2017, has been released by SBP today. As highlighted by the report, the key
development of the quarter is broad based and robust growth in advances to private sector
which is also the prime reason behind 8.3 percent growth in the asset base.

The gross advances (domestic) to private sector have increased by 6.1 percent in comparison
to 4.0 percent growth recorded in the corresponding period of last year. Besides seasonal
financing need for commodity procurement, the financing demand has come from various
sectors including chemical/pharmaceutical, production and transmission of energy,
agribusiness, food and allied products, construction, transport, storage etc. Moreover, the
continued growth in auto financing has pushed consumer financing up. The surge in
advances may be attributed to enabling macroeconomic conditions such as monetary easing
which has lowered the cost of borrowing and positive feedback from the real economy —
particularly the consistent activity in large scale manufacturing.

The asset quality of the banking sector has improved further as Gross Non Performing Loans
(NPLs) ratio has moved down to 9.3 percent as of end June 2017 from 9.9 percent as of end
March 2017 (and 11.1 percent as of end June, 2016).

Investments have increased by 5.6 percent and Government papers remain the prime
attraction. There is a change in investment pattern, though, as banks have mostly invested in
short-term MTBs. Continuous rise in investment in Government securities has further
strengthened the already comfortable liquidity position of the banking system.

The deposit base of the banking sector has moved up by 6.5 percent, slightly lesser than 6.8
percent in Q2CY16. The deceleration in deposit growth is mainly caused by dip in financial
institutions’ deposit — which are transitory in nature. On the other hand, the customer
deposits — relatively more stable funding source and comprising 96.5 percent share in overall
deposit base — has surged by 7.7 percent; higher than 6.0 percent during the corresponding
period last year.

Banking sector has earned profit (before tax) of PKR 150.4 billion with strong ROA of 1.8
percent and ROE of 21.9 percent. Encouragingly, interest earnings (Year-to-date) have
increased by 1.0 percent in Q2CY17 (against 8.6 percent decline during the same period last
year) on account of income on advances.

Prime Minister launches scheme for promotion of home remittances through M-wallets

 

Prime Minister Mr. Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that Government of Pakistan is taking several strategic
initiatives to promote inflow of home remittances in the country. ‘In continuation of our efforts, | am
pleased that GoP in collaboration with the SBP and financial industry is launching a scheme for

promotion of home remittances through m-wallets, he said.

He was addressing the launching ceremony of ‘Promotion of Home Remittances through M-wallet
Accounts.’ The Prime Minister said that the scheme will help in channelizing home remittances through
Branchless Banking (BB) channels. ‘It will help achieve twin objectives’, said the PM, ‘Firstly, it will
facilitate the populace by provision of home remittances in swift, convenient and cost effective manner
by utilizing the network of BB agents across Pakistan; secondly, it will help enhance the usage of m-
wallets and creation of digital accounts.’ Mr. Abbasi also announced Government’s budgetary support to
incentivize home remittances through M—Wallet accounts.

The Prime Minister reminded the audience that since 2013, after coming to power, his party had made
significant strides as it stabilized economy, accelerated GDP growth and introduced structural reforms to
uplift the living conditions of the common man. He said that financial inclusion is considered as one of
the key instruments for economic development. ‘Unfortunately, Pakistan is among the countries
accounting for around 5 percent of the world’s unbanked population,’ he said adding ’In Pakistan only
23% of the adult population has access to formal financial services.’

Mr. Abbasi said that in Pakistan remittances have been the second-highest source of foreign exchange
earnings for the country, after export receipts. ‘Over the past 10 years, remittances have grown at a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 12 percent — one of the highest growth rates for any
country in the world,’ he said adding, ‘Pakistan’s relatively better performance in the region is principally
attributed to sustained increase in emigrant workers during past few years and supportive policies of
the Government and the State Bank.’ He also appreciated the role of the Pakistan Remittance Initiative

(PRI) in strong growth in remittances.

Earlier, in his welcoming address, the Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Mr. Tariq Bajwa thanked
the Prime Minister for his visit to SBP and launching this important initiative. Introducing the scheme of
home remittances through M-Wallets, the Governor stated that that it will help to achieve two
objectives: one, increasing financial inclusion in the country; and, two, making transfer of home
remittances faster and at low cost, thus competing with informal channels of delivery.

SBP Issues Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk Management Framework for Financial
Institutions

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has issued Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk
Management Framework for Financial Institutions (Fls). The Framework has been developed
after extensive consultation with both internal & external stakeholders. Earlier on March 14,
2017, the draft of the framework was published for public consultation.

The framework is based on principles of international standards and best practices for
technology governance and risk management including cyber security. It aims to provide
enabling regulatory environment for managing risks associated with the use of technology.
The instructions aims to enhance the proactive environment in Fls to various aspects of the
information technology, security, operations, audit and related domains and to create overall
safe and secure technology operations in Fls that will benefit and enhance the confidence of
all the stakeholders.

The framework will apply to all Fis which includes commercial banks (public and private
sector banks), Islamic banks, Development Finance Institutions (DFls), and Microfinance
Banks (MFBs). The framework is not ""one-size-fits-all"" and implementation of the same shall
be risk-based and commensurate with size, nature and types of products and services and
complexity of IT operations of the individual Fls.

While implementing this framework, Fils are expected to exercise sound judgment to
determine the applicable provisions relevant to their technology risk profile. Senior
management of the FI(s) will monitor the implementation of this framework on an ongoing
basis and the Board of Directors will review the implementation process on quarterly basis.
SBP has further advised the Fls to follow a phased approach towards implementation of the
framework starting with a gap analysis between their current status and this framework,
development/update of the policy framework, on-the-ground implementation and follow up
review and feedback. Accordingly, the FI(s) have been required to upgrade their systems,
controls and procedures by June 30, 2018.

PKR -USS exchange rate adjusts in the interbank market

Today, the PKR-USS exchange rate in the interbank market closed at Rs 107 per USS. During the day,
PKR depicted high and low of Rs.109.50 and Rs.105.55 respectively

Almost half way into the current fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy is well positioned to achieve the real
GDP growth target of 6 percent in 2017-18. This positive outlook is supported by a broad-based 8.4%
growth in Large Scale Manufacturing during the first quarter of the year, and encouraging assessment
of major crops, while services are likely to benefit from the positive spillovers of the growing
commodity sector. Strong growth in private sector credit, particularly in fixed investment loans, also
reflects the dynamism in the real economic activity. Moreover, inflation continues to remain low and
stable, and stood at 3.6 percent during the first five months of the year.

On external front, exports recorded a double-digit growth during Jul-Oct FY18; Foreign Direct
Investment reached a nine-year high; and workers’ remittances posted a modest growth. However,
the continuation of high growth in imports led to a widening of current account deficit, and
consequently to depletion in the country’s foreign exchange reserves. These pressures have
persisted leading to the adjustment in inter-bank exchange rate. This movement in the exchange rate
is based on demand and supply of foreign exchange in the interbank market.

SBP is of the view that this market-driven adjustment in the exchange rate will contain the imbalance
in the external account and sustain higher growth trajectory. The exchange rate will continue to
reflect the demand and supply conditions; and SBP stands ready to intervene, in case speculative
and/or momentary pressures emerge, for smooth functioning of the foreign exchange markets.

State Bank allows clearinghouse membership to CDNS

In order to facilitate the general public, SBP has allowed clearinghouse membership to
Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS).

State Bank has issued instructions to all the banks to accept profit coupon / withdrawals slips
pertaining to Pensioners Benefit Account (PBA), Behbood Saving Certificate (BSC) and Saving
Account (SA) of CDNS. The investors can now deposit these instruments directly into their
bank accounts, located anywhere in Pakistan. These instruments will be cleared by CDNS
through NIFT. Upon receipt of successful clearance from National Savings, banks will then
credit respective accounts of such investors.

This initiative will enable the investors of CDNS to receive profit/credit directly into their
accounts maintained with their banks which would serve as proficient and a safe mechanism
for the general public.

It may be recalled that prior to clearing house membership of CDNS, its investors had to
personally visit National Saving Centers (NSCs) to receive their monthly profits. This was
source of inconvenience for the investors, especially widows and senior citizens, who waited
in long queues to receive their profits.

State Bank’s support to the initiative was in line with its strategic objective to develop a
modern and robust payment system to provide efficient, secure and low cost payment
services to the general public under SBP Strategic Plan 2016-2020.

National Debt Retirement Program

It may be recalled that the Federal Government had launched National Debt Retirement Program
(NDRP) to pay off the ever increasing national debt in 1997. Funds in NDRP were accepted from
individuals, firms, companies and institutions etc. as Donations (NDRP-I), Qarz-e-Hasna (NDRP-II) and
Term Deposit (NDRP-III). A total of Rs.1.2 billion was received in local currency and USD 178 million

was received in foreign currency under the program.

The deposits under NDRP-I (Donations) were non-refundable whereas deposits under NDRP-II and
NDRP-III were for a minimum period of two years. The depositors were issued a receipt/certificate
against deposits under NDRP-II by banks whereas Special Saving Certificates (SSC) /Defence Saving
Certificates (DSC) were issued against deposits under NDRP-III by Central Directorate of National
Savings, Ministry of Finance. After the maturity, the depositors were able to encash their amounts at
par in case of NDRP-II and as per terms & conditions of SSC / DSC for deposits under NDRP-III. Out of
total receipts of Rs.1.2 billion in local currency, Rs.823 million were donations and Rs.408 million were
in the form of Qarz-e-Hasna and term deposits. As of now an amount of only Rs.12 million (approx)
has not been en-cashed/reclaimed by the depositors. Similarly out of total FCY receipts of USD 178
million, USD 28 million was donations and remaining USD 150 million was Qarz-e-Hasna and term

deposits. Almost all FCY deposits have been repaid.

While we have informed the public through a press release on 29"" March 2017 to approach their
respective banks to get their certificates en-cashed, there are still complains that the depositors are
facing difficulties in encashment of the certificates. While the term deposits (NDRP Ill) are en-

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on 13th November 2017 organized a ‘Compliance Forum Session’ for
guidance and awareness of financial institutions in implementation of Risk-based approach and alert
them regarding upcoming Anti Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
mutual evaluation of Pakistan. Besides presence of senior officials from supervisory departments of SBP,
relevant officers from Banks, Developments Finance Institutions (DFls), Microfinance Banks (MFBs),
Exchange Companies and Payment System Operators also participated.

The session was chaired by Executive Director - Banking Policy & Regulations Group who observed that
the AML/CFT compliance is a global phenomenon which has implications for economic and trade related
activities with rest of the world. He highlighted the importance of implementing AML/CFT regime and
need for further improvements in areas of transaction monitoring through sophisticated technology
coupled with appropriate human resources for identifying and reporting suspicious transactions under
the AML laws. He urged reporting entities to refine their efforts in risk based AML/CFT compliance and
prepare well for the upcoming AML/CFT assessment.

In his presentation, the senior officer of the SBP discussed in detail the essential elements of technical
compliance and effectiveness of FATF Recommendations in the context of upcoming AML/CFT mutual
evaluation of Pakistan. During the session, the requisite actions including preparation of statistics/
responses to FATF assessment criteria came up for discussion and it was observed that the whole
process would require dedicated efforts and seamless coordination from all AML/CFT stakeholders. The
presentation was followed by Question & Answer session.

In accordance with Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) membership rules, every member
country is required to undergo a process of Mutual Evaluation/ Assessment to determine the level of
compliance with the international AML/CFT standards. Mutual evaluation involves a desk-based review
as well as an on-site visit by a team of experts drawn from the member countries to assess a country’s
AML/CFT systems. Previously, Pakistan has undergone two mutual evaluations in 2005 & 2009 and next
mutual evaluation on FATF’s revised standards is expected to start in the first quarter of 2018.

Apropos the statements made by member National Assembly, Mr. Asad Umar, during a meeting of
the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and
Privatization, it is unfortunate that allegations of involvement of State Bank of Pakistan in money

SBP, categorically, rejects such allegations of its involvement in money laundering and clarifies that
there is no request for information pending with it.

In this context, it is clarified that on December 19, 2016, SBP received a set of questions from the
Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization, National
Assembly Secretariat regarding advertisements published in Pakistani newspapers inviting people to
invest in property in Dubai etc. Some of these questions pertained to SBP while rest fall in the domain
of other Government agencies. On January 03, 2017, SBP responded through Finance Division while
answering the questions relevant to SBP. Previously, SBP had also provided its views on issues
related to buying of properties in Dubai raised by the same MNA in NA committee meeting.

Banks Disbursed Agricultural Credit of Rs 704.5 billion in FY 2016-17

Banks have surpassed the agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs. 700 billion set by Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) for FY 2016-17. Agri. Lending banks have disbursed Rs 704.5
billion which is 17.8% higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs 598.3 billion. Further, the agri.
outstanding portfolio increased to Rs 405.8 billion on end June, 2017 registering a hefty growth of
17.4% compared with the last year’s position of Rs 345.6 billion. Similarly, the agricultural credit
outreach has increased to 3.27 million farmers at end June 2017 from 2.40 million farmers last year.

The achievement of agri. credit disbursement target was an uphill task due to high risk perception of
banks about agri. financing and volatile prices of agri. commodities etc. However, SBP continued to
implement its multipronged strategy for achievement of agri-credit target set by government which
included; sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing as a viable business line, exploring new financing
products; value chain financing, warehouse receipts financing, digitalization of credit, execution of
credit guarantee scheme for small & marginalized farmers and inclusion of microfinance institutions/
rural support programs for catering the credit needs of marginalized farmers.

However, this achievement would have not been possible without the dynamic leadership of SBP and
active support of the Government. Further, monitoring efforts included rigorous follow up with the
top management of banks and agri. credit heads and holding of regular follow-up meetings with
regional management. Conducting farmers’ awareness and financial literacy programs at grass root
level were also instrumental.

The detailed credit performance reveals that five major banks collectively disbursed agri. loans of Rs
342.0 billion or 100.6% of their annual target of Rs 340.0 billion which is higher by 9.9% from Rs 311.4
billion disbursed during the corresponding period last year. Amongst the five major banks, NBP has
achieved 105 % of its annual target, MCB achieved 103.2%, HBL 101.1%, UBL 100.5% and ABL
achieved 85.4 % of individual annual targets.

Under specialized banks category, ZTBL disbursed Rs 92.5 billion or 90.2% of its annual target of Rs
102.5 billion while PPCBL has disbursed Rs 10.9 billion by achieving 87% against its target of Rs 12.5
billion during FY 2016-17.

Fifteen domestic private banks, as a group, achieved 99.6% of their target. Within this group Soneri
Bank, Bank of Punjab, Bank of Khyber, Bank Alfalah, Faysal Bank, JS Bank, Habib Metro, Summit and
Silk Bank have surpassed their annual targets. However, Sindh Bank achieved 94.3%, First Women
Bank 90.2%, Bank Al Habib 84%, Askari Bank 81% and Standard Chartered could achieve 73.5% of
their annual targets.

Ten microfinance banks, as a group, have surpassed their annual targets of Rs 60.1 billion by
disbursing agri. loans of Rs 87.8 billion or 146% to small farmers during FY 2016-17. Khushhali, NRSP
Microfinance Bank, Telenor MF, First Microfinance Bank, Mobilink and U Microfinance Bank have
surpassed their targets while APNA Micro Finance achieved 96%, Pak Oman 65.5% and Sindh
Microfinance Bank could achieve only 39.4% of its annual target.

New Data Centre to tackle money laundering and
terrorism financing at Financial Monitoring Unit

Tracking down money laundering and terrorism financing will now be easier thanks to a new high
tech data centre that was inaugurated by the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the British High
Commissioner and the Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) at
the Financial Monitoring Unit in Karachi on Friday the 10” of February 2017.

This new, state of the art, integrated data centre for anti-money laundering and countering terrorism
financing was established with the financial assistance of the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) and support of UNODC. The centre is going to host a specialist analytical suite of
software (goAML) developed by UNODC. It will enable the Financial Monitoring Unit to automate
collection and analysis of suspicious financial transactions being received from banks, exchange
companies and other reporting entities in Pakistan. Moreover the integrated system will enhance the
capability of FMU in disseminating financial intelligence to designated law enforcement agencies in
an efficient manner.

Previously, analysis of financial data at the autonomous Financial Monitoring Unit was undertaken
manually which was slow and vulnerable to oversights. Now, the customised software and high
precision equipment installed in the new data centre will allow the Financial Monitoring Unit to
analyse suspicious transactions and currency transactions in a more robust, sophisticated and
automated manner. This centre will greatly enhance FMU’s capacity to generate more meaningful
financial intelligence with the prospect of identifying, prosecuting, and deterring a greater number of
criminals and terrorists operating in the country.

The Governor of the State Bank said:

“lam confident that FMU’s Data Centre will strengthen its ability to generate better financial
intelligence which would help our law enforcement agencies in successful investigations and
prosecutions of money launderers and terrorism financers.”

Mr. Thomas Drew CMG, British High Commissioner said:

“The UK Government is proud to have supported the establishment of the Financial Monitoring Unit’s
data centre, as part of the Pakistan Government’s wider commitment to tackle financial crime. This is
a great step forward by Pakistan to meet its international obligations and close the space for money
laundering and terrorism financing in the country.”

The Representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Mr Cesar Guedes said:

“The launch of the data centre at FMU today and its future utilisation for the goAML system
supported by the UNODC will be recorded as a significant step taken for the People of Pakistan to
build a transparent, just, and fair society in which suspicious financial transactions and financing of
terrorism are monitored, deterred and prevented.”

The Director General for the Financial Monitoring Unit, Syed Mansoor, said:

“The fusion of this hard and soft technology is ready to give FMU the edge that we required, and with
the assistance of our reporting entities, FMU will disseminate financial intelligence with a lot more
substance, which will eventually assist our LEAs in successful conclusion of investigations”

Deputy Governor SBP for managing risks

to stability of financial sector

Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Riaz Riazuddin has emphasized on
managing the risks to stability of the financial sector for maintaining un-interrupted
availability of financial services, raising investors’ confidence and enhancing reach of
financial access to potential areas. He has stressed upon the need for putting in place
effective financial stability framework and enhancing the cross boarder supervisory

corporation.

Mr. Riazuddin was addressing the inaugural session of the seminar on “Financial
Stability” being hosted by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) from 27th to 28th March,
2017 under the auspices of SAARCFINANCE Forum at National Institute of Banking
and Finance (NIBAF), Islamabad. The SAARCFINANCE is a network of Central Bank
Governors and Finance Secretaries of the SAARC region established to share
experiences on macroeconomic policy issues among member countries including

Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Afghanistan.

The seminar on Financial Stability was attended by around 40 mid to senior level
officials from five central banks of SAARC member countries and Securities and
Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). Local and foreign financial sector experts
from Pakistan, multilateral agency and foreign banks shared views on topics related to

financial stability and the role of central banks and financial institutions.

While welcoming the participants, Mr. Amer Aziz, Managing Director, NIBAF,
highlighted the facilitating role played by NIBAF, in collaboration with SBP, in
arranging such seminars. He stressed upon the participants to engage in lively
discussions with the speakers and among themselves to gain maximum benefits from

the seminar on “Financial Stability”.

Deputy Governor SBP for review of Banks’ Business Models to Adapt to the Changing landscape

Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Jameel Ahmad, has emphasized the need for a review of
the prevailing banking business models to effectively address the challenges of rapidly changing financial
and technological landscape.

Mr. Ahmad was addressing eminent scholars, industry practitioners and leading professionals on the
topic of “Changing Dynamics: Bank of the Future” as a key note speaker at the 29"" Annual Convention of
Association of Professional Bankers (APB)—Sri Lanka, held at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo on 21*
November, 2017.

Deputy Governor, SBP in his speech reflected on the prevailing course of banking and said that the shifts
in the supervisory approach of regulators and the regulatory measures that were taken after the Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-8 as well as rapid technological developments are mainly reshaping the future of
banking. “Although the reforms that were undertaken after the Global Financial Crisis were focused on
achieving financial stability have improved the overall resilience of the financial system, , they have
increased the complexity of the regulatory framework from multiple perspectives”, he highlighted
adding, “This has resulted in contraction of cross border lending, partial scaling back of off shore
operations of multinational banks and a decline in the post crisis profitability of banks”.

Mr. Ahmad highlighted that in the wake of the rise of internet and social media and availability of low
cost mobile and other smart devices, bank customers are demanding enhanced and more customized
services. If banks fail to address them, they may face extensive competition from non-banks and fintechs
who are rapidly making inroads in the domain of financial intermediation.

The Deputy Governor also spoke briefly on the role and plans of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to
transform the domestic banking sector. He shared that in order to mitigate growing risks to the banking
sector SBP took certain measures like continuous improvements in regulatory framework, building of
Financial Stability Architecture and addressing concerns about Systemic Risks using macro-prudential
actions like Developing frameworks for Large Exposures, Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs)
and Consolidated Supervision.

Mr. Ahmad briefed the gathering about SBPs role as a facilitator and catalyst of innovation especially in
the domain of payments digitization. “SBP has issued various guidelines and instructions for the
development and strengthening of Payment Systems infrastructure in the country”, he said. He also
shared SBPs proactive approach in using the National Identity System, NADRA for allowing digital on-
boarding of customers, especially the unbanked population, and mitigating the risks relating to Money
Laundering and Terrorist Financing.

State Bank issues revised instructions regarding imports made on open account basis

In order to facilitate international trade, the State Bank has dispensed with the requirement of
submission of original shipping/transport documents to the Authorized Dealers by the importers for
payments against imports made on open account basis.

Earlier, importers were, interalia, required to present original shipping/transport documents to
Authorized Dealers for effecting the related import payments.

The initiative has been taken in the wake of requests from different stakeholders including various
chambers of commerce, importers, banks etc. as international trade is witnessing shift from physical
transfer of original transport documents to electronically transmitted transport documents, Telex
Release etc. to save cost and time involved in physical transfer of such documents from foreign seller
to the importer. Further, implementation of Electronic Import Form (EIF) by the State Bank and
Pakistan Customs has strengthened the monitoring of imports into Pakistan and related payments,

thus, the possibility of multiple payments against single import consignment through different banks
stands eliminated.

It would not only provide facilitation to importers but would equally be beneficial for the exporters
who import inputs/raw materials for manufacturing of exportable goods/products.

Agreement to initiate collection of Government taxes
and duties through internet banking and ATM

 

State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Board of Revenue and 1-Link have signed an agreement in
Islamabad today to develop a mechanism enabling public to pay FBR taxes and customs duty
using internet banking or ATMs. The signing ceremony was chaired by Finance Minister Mr.
Muhammad Ishaq Dar. The Advisor to the Prime Minister on Revenue, Mr. Haroon Akhtar
Khan was also present in the ceremony.

The facility would be available round the clock /7 days a week. As per the proposed mechanism
the banks will add FBR (Inland Revenue) and FBR (Customs) as Billers in the Billers Module and
develop necessary interface with 1-Link. After the system is made operational, the tax
payers/importers will fill their tax and custom duty payment details in the FBR (IRS) and
Customs (WeBOC) online modules to generate payment slip ID (PSID). The PSID will then be
used to access the tax/duty payment details on banks’ webpage or ATM as the case may be.
The tax payer or their agent will then pay the tax by debiting his/her bank account for onward
credit to the respective government account in SBP BSC. The whole process will be online and
fully automated.

The SBP has also advised banks to add FBR and Customs as Billers in the Bill Payment System
offered by 1-link and develop necessary integration with 1-link within 2 months i.e. by 5th
December 2017. The system will be made operational by 31st December 2017 after necessary
testing. The banks have been advised to demonstrate full ownership and commitment for
successful and timely implementation of this strategically important project, which will bring
huge efficiency gains besides facilitating the public in hassle free payment of government taxes
and duties.

The Finance Minister Mr. Muhammad Ishaq Dar on the occasion congratulated State Bank and
FBR for initiating such an important project, which would revolutionize the government tax
collection mechanism. He expressed hope that all the formalities would be completed at the
earliest and that the system would be operational by 31° December, 2017. The Governor SBP
added that the initiative is part of SBP Vision 2020, which envisages development of the robust
payment system and it’s primarily aimed at facilitating the tax payers and public at large in
payment of taxes. The Chairman FBR, Mr. Tariq Mehmood Pasha, on the occasion said that the
project is the result of collaboration and cooperation between FBR, SBP and the private sector
and will go a long way in further improving the government tax collection systems.

Growth in advances to private sectors exceeds historical
trend, says the SBP’s Fourth Quarterly Report for CY16

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector
for the quarter ended 31 December, 2016 (Q4CY16) today. In terms of the QPR, the key highlight of
the quarter is the impressive growth in advances to private sector; highest 4"" quarter growth in the
last 10 years. The solvency profile of the banking sector remains robust as Capital Adequacy Ratio
(CAR) of 16.17 percent is well above the minimum required level of 10.65 percent. Deposit growth
has remained on steady path while 4"" quarter’s profit has improved over last years’ though entire
year’s profit slightly narrowed owing to low interest rate environment.

The report highlights that the asset base of the banking sector has expanded by 4.6 percent in
Q4CY16. The key contribution has come from demand for credit from private sector; thanks to lag
impact of monetary easing, better economic conditions, and improved liquidity. Positively, a bounce
back in the advances flow has been observed in the textile sector; the largest borrower of the
banking sector. Besides, sugar, energy, agribusiness, and cement are some other sectors which have
availed major financing from the banking sector in Q4CY16. Banks’ investments, however, have
fallen by 1.5 percent during Q4CY16 mainly on account of decline in investments in government
securities.

Deposits — the key funding source of the banking sector - have observed growth of 6.4 percent in
Q4CY16 (13.6 percent growth in the Calendar Year 2016). The addition in the overall deposits has
been contributed by non-remunerative current deposits followed by fixed deposits and saving
deposits. The report highlights that the high deposit growth in the 4"""" quarter as well in the entire
year is a welcome sign considering deceleration in deposit growth observed in the last couple of
years.

The asset quality of the banking sector has improved with decline in non-performing loans (NPLs)
and corresponding ratios. Particularly, NPLs to loans ratio receded to 10.1 percent, the lowest level
in eight years. Importantly, besides pick up in advances, recoveries in NPLs have played a pivotal role
in bringing the ratio down. The coverage ratio (provisions to NPLs), has jumped up to 85.0 percent in
QACY16 (82.7 percent in Q3CY16).

The dip in interest margins and reduced quantum of investment has narrowed the Year-to-Date
profitability of the banking sector. As a result, return on assets (RoA) has declined to 2.1 percent as
compared to 2.5 percent in Q4CY15. However, strong solvency remains intact as CAR of 16.17
percent as of December 31, 2016 is well above the minimum required level of 10.65 percent.

PRESS RELEASE

NAB investigation against SBP officials

The SBP Act 1956 mandates SBP to regulate the credit system of the country and empowers it through
the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 for this purpose. Using its authority and powers, SBP decided to
amalgamate KASB Bank into Banklslami in 2015 after a moratorium was imposed by the Federal
Government on its request to safeguard the interests of depositors and to ensure safety and soundness
of the banking system of the country. This step was taken due to poor financial condition of defunct
KASB bank and its inability to meet regulatory requirements despite opportunities being provided for an
extended period of time.

Since then a smear campaign was run in some quarters of media to dub this action by SBP against the law
and malign its staff for misuse of authority. Taking notice of these reports, the National Accountability
Bureau (NAB) initiated an inquiry into the matter and recently it has been learnt from its press release
that an investigation has been authorized against the officials of SBP for alleged misuse of authority in
terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into Banklslami.

SBP finds this decision of NAB to convert its inquiry into investigation disappointing since the inquiry
report available in the media does not appear to have incorporated all the detailed input provided by SBP
during the process and released through its communications to the general public. Such one sided views
lead to misjudgment about the authority of SBP as a guardian of the financial sector in general and the
interest of depositors in particular. Further, it negatively impacts the motivation of SBP staff to discharge
its duties without fear or favor.

All stakeholders of the defunct KASB Bank were well aware of the poor financial and operating conditions
of defunct bank, which was facing severe capital shortfall since 2009. As of September 30, 2014 Capital
(free of losses) of the defunct KASB Bank was only Rs 0.958 billion against requirement of Rs 10 billion.
Moreover, its Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was negative 4.63% against the required 10%. It was the only
bank which had a negative CAR.

Even the external auditors of the defunct KASB Bank in bank’s audited account as of 31° December 2013
also expressed concern over capital position of the bank. State Bank of Pakistan gave ample time and
opportunities to the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank to inject further capital into the bank so as to
make it capital compliant and viable bank. The sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank could not fulfill their
commitments for capital injection despite SBP’s consistent persuasion and instructions, nor could arrange
merger of the bank with any other bank. Besides capital shortfall, the bank and its sponsors were found
engaged in fraudulent practices and siphoning off more than Rs 3 billion from the bank, for which
separate complaints have been lodged with NAB.

Further, the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank introduced M/s. Cybernaut Investment Group of China,
as a potential investor. Following the procedure, SBP required documentation to establish their
credentials and proof of availability of funds worth USS100 million. Neither was provided. This left SBP
with no other option but to accept the offer of sole remaining interested party, i.e. Banklslami. No

Monetary Policy Statement
September 29, 2017

Macroeconomic environment remains conducive to growth without impacting headline
inflation. Favorable initial estimates of major crops, a healthy growth in credit to private sector
and growing productive imports all indicate solid gains in the real sector. On the back of
adequate food supplies and stable international commodity prices, headline inflation
decelerated in the first two months of FY18. The pursuit of higher economic growth however
poses growing challenges partly enunciated at the start of FY18. These include those arising
from pressures on the external front and an expansionary fiscal policy.

Expounding the real sector, full year LSM data indicates a healthy and broad-based growth of
5.7 percent for FY17 as compared to its earlier estimates of 4.9 percent. In fact, LSM for July 2017
posted a growth of 13.0 percent. Delving deeper into FY18, manufacturing activity is expected
to benefit from higher development spending, growing investments in CPEC-related projects,
improvement in security condition, and the continued trend of stable and low cost of
borrowing. Furthermore, an upbeat industrial outlook and a promising assessment of major
crops are going to have positive spillovers on the services sector. Based on current projections
of agriculture sector growth, GDP growth is likely to reach the annual target of 6.0 percent for
FY18 leading to an improved capacity to accommodate rising domestic demand.

Turning to inflation, average CPI inflation eased to 3.2 percent in Jul-Aug FY18 compared to 3.8
percent during the same period last year. With comfortable wheat and sugar stocks, no major
disruption is expected from supply side in the coming months of FY18. However, the core
inflation (non-food-non-energy), reflecting the underlying demand pressures in the economy,
continues to maintain its higher level of 5.6 percent in the initial two months of the fiscal year.
This is also visible from IBA-SBP’s Consumer Confidence Survey of September 2017, which
shows a modest rise in expected inflation during the next six months. Thus, with these demand
and supply side dynamics, average CPI inflation is expected to remain well below FY18 target
of 6.0 percent.

As depicted by core inflation, changes in monetary aggregates also indicate growing demand in
the economy. Although credit to private sector recorded a net seasonal retirement of Rs 80.6
billion during 1st July to 15t September FY18, its year-on-year growth has edged up to 21.1
percent on 15th September 2017- as compared to 7.7 percent on 16k September 2016, reflecting
an increase of Rs 892 billion during the year. Led by historic low interest rates on the one hand
and growing construction activity and consumer durables on the other, demand for credit
picked up. At the same time, healthy deposit growth has improved supply of loanable funds
with the banking sector and market rates remained stable. These favorable conditions at the
beginning of upcoming credit cycle bode well for healthy credit off take for yet another year.

The higher trajectory of economic growth has generated complementary external sector
pressures. The current account deficit for the first two months of FY18 has widened to US$ 2.6
billion. This is primarily driven by higher imports of productive goods, especially of machinery,
metal and petroleum products. The increase in import of these three groups was strong enough

and filling the gap on much needed knowledge about corporate governance. The book provides a
comprehensive guide to the policy framework, principles, and practices of corporate governance in
Pakistan. It also attempts to capture the essence of corporate environment in Pakistan on the eve of
the introduction of the first Code of Corporate Governance. The edited work of various contributors is
mainly divided into three parts in the book titled Policy Framework: Laying the Foundation of
Corporate Governance; Towards Greater Responsibility, Accountability, and Transparency and
Practical Application: Implementing in Letter and Spirit.

Ms. Khan has more than twenty years of value driven leadership experience across Asia, Europe and

Press Release on State Bank’s Business Confidence Survey (Telephonic)

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) regulates the monetary and credit system of Pakistan and fosters its
growth in the best national interest with a view to securing monetary stability and fuller utilisation of
the country’s productive resources. Like many other central banks, it weighs up the public and firms
perceptions about prevailing and expected economic condition, as an important part of its monetary
policy formulation process.

For this purpose, SBP is already conducting telephonic surveys of households (Consumer Confidence
Survey-CCS) that are selected randomly across the country. These surveys are conducted after every
two months and provide information on “what people are thinking” about the economy. The results
of CCS are available at SBP website (http://dsqx.sbp.org.pk/ccs/index.ph

Continuing with the spirit of seeking input from its main stakeholders, State Bank of Pakistan is now
planning to obtain opinion of firms about current and expected business conditions in the country.

The Business Confidence Survey (BCS) will be a telephonic survey lasting between 7 to 10 minutes
with a senior executive of participating firms requiring them to answer some quick questions. This
survey will be conducted all over the country in October 2017 and will be repeated periodically. All
the information collected through the survey will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be
shared with any other person or entity. Furthermore, it will not be used for any purpose other than
research on economic conditions. We are conducting this survey with the collaboration of Institute of
Business Administration, Karachi.

SBP encourages all firms operating in different areas and sectors to participate in this survey in the
best national interest.

In case of any queries/clarification, kindly contact at the following address:

The Director, Research Department, State Bank of Pakistan, 8"" Floor Main Building, 1.1. Chundrigar
Road, Karachi. Phone: 021-99221161. Fax: 021-99221299. You can also send an e-mail at

State Bank’s Fresh Currency Notes Service 8877 Receives
Overwhelming Public Response

In order to meet the public demand for fresh currency notes on the occasion of Eid ul Fitr 2017, the
State Bank of Pakistan Banking Services Corporation (SBP BSC) re-launched the SMS Short Code based
service (8877) for issuance of fresh currency notes on the occasion of this Ramzan as well from June
12, 2017.

The service has been made available through a network of 1002 e-branches of banks in 120 cities and
16 field offices of SBP BSC across Pakistan. This service has once again attracted overwhelming
response of the general public. SBP is pleased to inform the general public that so far around 1.6
million individuals have obtained booking code out of which around 40% have received fresh cash
from the above branches against surrender of exchange value. Given the capacity of the bank
branches to handle customers, we expect that the service will reach its maximum limit of bookings in
few days and further bookings will be not possible thereafter.

The general public is apprised that the booking service will be closed after reaching its maximum
limit, expected by end of June 20, 2017 and as such no booking code will be issued thereafter.
However the member of general public who would have obtained booking code for issuance of fresh
cash shall be eligible to draw the same up to close of business on Friday the 23 June 2017 subject to
validity of the booking code.

It would be pertinent to mention that apart from this SMS service banks may continue to provide
fresh notes to their customers from their branches and ATMs as sufficient quantity is being provided
to them by State Bank.

Monetary Policy Statement
July 22, 2017

At the start of FY18, three features of Pakistan’s economy stand out. First, average headline inflation though
higher than FY17 is expected to be lower than earlier outlook and will stay below the target of 6.0 percent,
mainly on the back of favorable supply conditions. Second, domestic demand is set to gain further traction as
evidenced in the current growth in the real sector, credit to private sector and imports. Third, on the external
front, the underperformance of both exports and workers’ remittances greatly impinged upon the current
account deficit which reached USD 12.1 billion in FY17. For the time being, the overall balance of payments
is expected to stay at a manageable level in FY18- an assessment relying on steady anticipated financial
account inflows and improvement in world growth. The first two features show that the economy is on an
expansionary phase, while the third feature highlights near-term balance of payments challenges.

Reflecting further on CPI tendencies, the headline inflation (in YoY terms) has softened at 3.9 percent in
June 2017, while core inflation has stayed at 5.5 percent since April 2017. The latter does indicate rising
demand. However, marginally lower six-months ahead inflation expectations- captured by IBA- SBP's
Consumer Confidence Survey of July-2017, show that these remain reasonably anchored. Accordingly, SBP is
projecting average CPI inflation in the range of 4.5 — 5.5 percent for FY18. This projection is explained by
lower than anticipated increase in international oil prices, recent behavior of CPI inflation in June 2017, stable
administered prices and lower inflationary expectations.

Turning to the real sector, cumulative LSM (YoY) growth statistics till May 2017 depict a strong positive
momentum with food (especially sugar), steel, cement, automobiles, electronics and pharmaceuticals in the
lead. Indeed, July-May LSM growth is 5.7 percent against 3.4 percent recorded during the same period last
year. Furthermore, the outcome of agriculture sector is far superior to FY16 reaching its target of 3.5 percent
in FY17. This performance is explained by better supplies of factors of production- positively affecting yields
of all major crops, and an increase in area under cultivation of sugarcane. The services sector posted 6.0
percent increase in FY17 compared to 5.5 percent increase in FY16. Going forward, these developments will
further entrench in FY18.

As far as the money markets are concerned, market liquidity was able to accommodate strong credit demand
from the private sector. In fact, increased economic activity, considerable increase in bank deposits, and low
interest rates translated into private sector credit flows in FY17 reaching a decade high of Rs748 billion as
compated with Rs446 billion in FY16. It is encouraging that fixed investments and working capital loans grew
by Rs 258.5 billion and Rs 360.5 billion in FY17 compared with an expansion of Rs 171.7 billion and Rs
219.3 billion last year, respectively. Demand for consumer financing, especially for auto and personal loans,
also gathered pace during FY17. These trends are set to continue in FY18 given the developments on the

real side.

On the external front, the current account deficit reached US$ 12.1 billion during FY17. While exports and
workers’ remittances declined, imports growth surged by 17.7 percent in FY17. This is mainly owing to
machinery imports both for CPEC and non-CPEC energy and infrastructure projects, whereas, imports for
plant up-gradation under the ongoing export package for the textiles sector also added pressures. However,
in view of the last four months performance, the decline in exports appears to have bottomed out.

The banking sector has remained sound and stable
in Q3CY17, says the 3"" QPR of the Banking Sector

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 30""
September, 2017, has been released by SBP today. As highlighted in the report, less than normal
seasonal fall in advances along with improved liquidity and strong solvency — well above the
minimum benchmark — are the key highlights of the 3rd quarter of CY17.

Despite the seasonal net retirements in commodity financing and sugar sector, the overall gross
advances (domestic) to private sector have declined marginally; significantly lesser than the
established 3 quarter financing dip. Advances demand from textile and other sectors (agriculture,
automobiles, electronics etc.) have been promising. Noticeably, the share of fixed investment (long-
term) advances in overall advances is persistently rising. Banks have continued to invest in short term
MTBs while investment in PIBs and Sukuk have declined. The deposit mobilization has remained on
track, primarily, on the back of growth in saving and fixed deposits.

Asset quality has improved as Non Performing Loans (NPLs) to gross advances (infection) ratio has
moved down to 9.2 percent as of end September 2017 from 9.3 percent as of end June 2017.
However, profitability has moderated further with the banking sector earning profit (before tax) of
PKR 195.3 billion during Jan-Sep, 2017 (ROA of 1.6 percent and ROE of 19.1 percent). Encouragingly,
Net Interest Income (NII) has improved (Year-on-Year basis) on account of rising interest earned on
advances. Capital Adequacy Ratio of the banking sector at 15.4 percent is well above the minimum
required level of 10.65 percent and advocates that banks have enough buffers available to meet
additional financing need of the market.

Governor SBP visits Pakistan Security Printing Corporation

The State Bank of Pakistan acquired the banknotes and prize bonds printing functions of Pakistan
Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) from the Federal Government in June 2017.Today, the Governor
Mr. Tariq Bajwa visited the PSPC for the first time where he was apprised about its functions in detail by
its management. He was also briefed about the printing process of currency notes and shown the
premises. While addressing the gathering of PSPC employees, he appreciated the hard work of its
employees in timely discharge of duties.

The Governor said that being the sole issuer of banknotes in the country SBP gives utmost importance to
the integrity and quality of banknotes along with its timely supply in the system. In order to have full
control over the process of banknotes manufacturing and issuance, the SBP deemed it necessary to
acquire the banknotes and prize bonds printing function of PSPC. “This is in line with the global and
regional trends as a number of central banks including Central Bank of France, Turkey, Italy, Australia,
India and various other central banks have their own banknotes printing facilities,” he said.

Governor further added that given the increasing need of currency notes due to expanding economy
and launch of new saving schemes, PSPC will have additional responsibilities in coming years. “To
accomplish these tasks in a befitting manner”, said the Governor, “We will have to determine the
quantum, quality and supply of banknotes, with good coordination of SBP Finance Department, SBP BSC
and PSPC. For that, we should have long- and short-term plans and set milestones”, he said.

Mr. Bajwa stated that manpower is the key to an efficient institution. Its skills and capacity determine
the pace of progress. “We will have to evaluate the existing manpower of PSPC and arrange for
harnessing its potential. Moreover, in view of the increasing needs of the Corporation, we will have to
hire new talent”, he remarked.

He said that modernity implies acquisition of new technology and strengthening the research and
development function. Modern technology not only facilitates the execution of functions but also is a
must for efficiency. We will have to assess the system and upgrade it. “Modern printing machinery will
be required for enhancing the printing capacity and improving the quality of banknotes. Besides PSPC
will have to join hands, with SBP BSC and SBP’s Finance Department to strength the research and
development function”, he concluded.

Deputy Governors Mr. Riaz Riazuddin and Mr. Jameel Ahmad and other senior officials also
accompanied the Governor. MD PSPC, Mr. Haroon Rasheed and other senior officials received the
Governor while MD National Security Printing Company, Mr. M. Misbah Tunio, MD Sicpa Inks Pakistan
(Pvt) Ltd Mr. Asif Ikram and Member PSPC Board Mr. M. Tanvir Butt were also present on the occasion.

Governor SBP Urges Banks to Address Geographical And Sectoral Imbalances for achieving
Rs 1 Trillion agri-credit target for FY 2017-18

The Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) meeting was held in Quetta, under the
chairmanship of Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Tariq Bajwa. The meeting was attended
by senior officers of SBP, presidents and executives of commercial banks, specialized banks,
microfinance banks & Islamic banks, representatives from federal & provincial governments, and
chamber of agriculture/ farmers associations.

Mr. Bajwa, while congratulating the ACAC members on surpassing the Rs 700 billion targets for the
fiscal year 20161-7, stressed upon four key areas requiring special attention of all stakeholders which
included (a) Strategizing the achievement of Rs. 1 trillion disbursement target; (b) Increasing financial
inclusion of smallholder farmers to address their credit needs, particularly for production loans; (c)
Rationalizing the markup rates on agricultural financing to pass on the benefit of historically low
discount rate and (d) Increasing bank’s footprint in underserved regions and provinces for reducing
regional disparities.

While delivering his keynote address, Mr. Bajwa emphasized that in order to successfully harness
untapped potential of agricultural, it is necessary to meet the credit demand. He highlighted critical
challenges confronted by the industry including provision of finance to small and marginalized
farmers, addressing geographical and sectoral imbalances and financing to non-crop activities need to
be addressed. In particular, financial institutions need to come up with new ideas and products for
spreading their outreach to remote and underserved areas like Balochistan. He also stated that there
is a huge scope and demand for Shariah compliant agri. financing products and recommended Islamic
banks to increase their focus on Islamic agri financing.

The Governor highlighted the active role played by the Central Bank for promoting agri. finance in the
country. He shared the SBP’s multifaceted approach to sensitize banks to adopt agricultural financing
as a viable business line. He informed the audience that due to joint efforts by SBP and the industry
for broadening access to finance in the country, formal credit disbursement by financial institutions
has increased to Rs 704.5 billion in FY 16-17 from Rs 391.4 billion in FY 12-13, showing a steep
increase of more than 80 percent in 4 years.

The key note address was followed by a presentation wherein the performance of banks on key
indicators relevant to agricultural financing was reviewed. The participants deliberated on the way
forward for credit enhancement in the underserved provinces/regions especially Balochistan.

PKR -USS exchange rate adjusts 3.1 percent in the interbank market

Today, the PKR-USS exchange rate in the interbank market has depreciated by 3.1 percent from Rs
104.90 per USS yesterday to Rs 108.25 per USS.

While almost all macroeconomic indicators have been showing encouraging picture, such as decade-
high real GDP growth, increase in investment, credit expansion to private sector, and subdued
inflation; the deficit in the external account has been rising for some time. Accordingly, the exchange
rate adjusted in the market and SBP is of the view that this depreciation in the exchange rate will

address the emerging imbalance in the external account and strengthen the growth prospects of the
country.

SBP also believes that the current exchange rate is broadly aligned with the economic fundamentals.
SBP will continue to closely monitor the developments in the foreign exchange markets and stands
ready to ensure stability in the financial markets.

SBP and WB ink agreement on Technical Cooperation for achieving SBP's Strategic Goals

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the World Bank (WB) inked an agreement on Technical Cooperation
for achieving the Strategic Goals under SBP’s Vision 2020 on January 28, 2017. This is the first such
agreement signed by the World Bank on Reimbursable Advisory Services(RAS) with any country in
South Asia Region. The signing ceremony was held after a meeting between Governor SBP Mr. Ashraf
Mahmood Wathra and CEO World Bank Ms. Kristalina Georgieva at a local hotel in Karachi.

SBP Strategic Plan (2016-2020) has been framed and built around to focus on resolution of
strategically important issues facing Pakistan’s economy and financial sector. While Pakistan has
made significant improvements in its economic fundamentals in recent years, the SBP Strategic Plan

Imposition of 100% Cash Margin on Import of Certain Consumer Items

State Bank of Pakistan, in exercise of powers entrusted to it under Banking Companies
Ordinance, 1962, has imposed 100% cash margin requirement on import of certain consumer
items. This regulatory measure would, interalia, discourage the import of these items and would
have nominal impact on the general public.

The requirement of 100% cash margin has been prescribed on items such as motor vehicles
(both CKDs and CBUs), mobile phones, cigarettes, jewelry, cosmetics, personal care, electrical &
home appliances, arms & ammunitions etc.

State Bank expects that this regulatory measure would help accommodate incremental import of

growth-inducing capital goods.

SBP clarifies financing gap numbers

This is to clarify that the estimate of financing gap for FY18, attributed to Governor SBP, appearing in
today’s newspapers is misconstrued. It appears that the numbers have been confused with the gross
external financing requirements of the country.

Financing gap is the difference between country’s estimated gross financing need and available
financing. SBP’s current estimates suggest that during FY18 the financing gap is likely to be around $2.5
billion, and NOT $ 12 billion as reported in the press.

Furthermore, it may be highlighted that the Government and SBP have recently taken several measures
to contain the financing gap. These include: (i) imposition of regulatory duties on non-essential imports
(ii) provision of un-interrupted energy to the export-oriented industries (iii) the export package worth
Rs180 billion and, (iv) introduction of Asaan Remittance Account to support the inflow of worker
remittances through official channels. These measures, together with the recent market-driven
adjustment in the exchange rate would help in narrowing the current account deficit, thereby reducing
the gross financing need.

State Bank of Pakistan designates Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)

 

State Bank of Pakistan has announced the designation of D-SIBs under the Domestic
Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) framework that was introduced in April 2018.

The D-SIBs framework as introduced by State Bank is consistent with the international
standards and practices and takes into account the local dynamics. It specifies the methodology
for identification and designation of D-SIBs, enhanced regulatory and supervisory requirements,
and implementation guidelines. These enhanced requirements aim to further strengthen the
resilience of big banks towards shocks and augment their risk management capacities.

The identification of D-SIBs involves two-step process. In the first step, sample banks are
identified each year based on the quantitative and qualitative criteria. In the second step, on
the basis of institutions’ systemic importance score as determined by their size,
interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity; D-SIBs are designated from among the
sample banks.

On the basis of the designation criteria, State Bank has designated Habib Bank Ltd (HBL),
National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), and United Bank Ltd (UBL) as D-SIBs. These banks will be
required to follow enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements, including the Higher
Loss Absorbency Capital surcharge in the form of additional core equity tier-1 capital (CET1).
The HBL will maintain CET1 of 2% while NBP and UBL will maintain additional CET1 of 1.5 %.

Besides these local banks, the branches of Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)
operating in Pakistan will hold additional CET1 capital against their risk-weighted assets in
Pakistan at the rate as applicable on the respective G-SIB.

The bank designated as D-SIB will be required to meet enhanced supervisory and regulatory
requirements by end of March 2019.

Monetary Policy Statement
January 2018

Pakistan’s economic growth is on track to achieve its highest level in the last eleven years. Average
headline inflation remains within the forecast range of SBP, but core inflation has continued to
increase. Fiscal deficit for H1-FY18 is expected to fall close to the last year’s 2.5 percent. There has
been visible improvement in export growth and remittances are marginally higher. However, largely
due to high level of imports the current account deficit remains under pressure. The exchange rate
adjustment in December 2017 is expected to help ease the pressure on the external front.

The progress in the real sector indicates that agriculture sector is set to perform better for the
second year in a row. Production of all major Kharif crops, except maize, has surpassed the level of
FY17. Similarly, large scale manufacturing (LSM) recorded a healthy broad-based growth of 7.2
percent during Jul-Nov FY18 as compared to 3.2 percent during the same period last year. While
there could be some deceleration in LSM growth due to sector specific issues such as sugar, POL
and fertilizer, overall industrial activity is likely to remain strong. Benefiting from both infrastructure
and CPEC related investments, construction and its allied industries are expected to maintain their
higher growth momentum. After incorporating the impact of commodity sector dynamics on the
services sector, the real GDP growth is projected to be around 5.8 percent, significantly higher than
FY17, but marginally lower than the annual target of 6 percent for FY18. This is largely due to
expectations of a below-target wheat crop because of a reduction in area under cultivation.

Average headline inflation for H1-FY18 stands at 3.8 percent. Meanwhile, core inflation (non-food-
non-energy) continued to maintain its higher trajectory, and clocked in at 5.5 percent during the first
half of the year as compared to 4.9 percent last year. This together with a lagged impact of PKR
depreciation and rising international oil prices are likely to increase inflation in the coming months.
Taking into account the impact of all these developments, while the average inflation for FY18 is
still projected to fall in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 percent, end of fiscal year YoY inflation is likely to
inch towards the annual target of 6 percent.

Broad money supply grew marginally by 1.9 percent during 1* Jul-12"" Jan FY18.. This is a reflection
of the decline in NFA and government efforts to contain expenditures. Higher tax collection and
proceeds from the issuance of Sukuk and Eurobond have led to reduction in net budgetary
borrowing which stood at Rs. 401.9 billion during 1"" Jul-12"" Jan FY18 as compared to Rs. 470.4
billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Moreover, the delay in the sugar crushing
season also contributed to a moderation of demand in private sector credit.

On the external front, export receipts posted the highest growth in the last seven years of 10.8
percent in H1-FY18 against a reduction of 1.4 percent in H1-FY17. Worker’s remittances also
recorded growth (2.5 percent) during the first half of the year as compared to a decline in the same
period last year. However, favorable impact of these positives was overshadowed by the
continuation of strong growth in imports of goods and services. The current account deficit
widened to US$ 7.4 billion during the first half of the year, which was 1.6 times of the deficit during
the same period last year. Developments in financial accounts show that one-fifth of this deficit was
financed by healthy foreign direct investments inflows, and the rest was managed by the official
flows and the country’s own resources. As a result, SBP’s liquid foreign exchange reserves

CAUTION REGARDING RISKS OF VIRTUAL CURRENCIES

General Public is advised that Virtual Currencies/Coins/Tokens (like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Pakcoin,
OneCoin, DasCoin, Pay Diamond etc.) are neither recognized as a Legal Tender nor has SBP
authorized or licensed any individual or entity for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange or
investment in any such Virtual Currencies/Coins/Tokens in Pakistan. Further, Banks/ DFls/
Microfinance Banks and Payment System Operators (PSOs)/ Payment Service Providers (PSPs) have
been advised not to facilitate their customers/account holders to transact in Virtual Currencies/ Initial
Coin Offerings (ICOs) /Tokens vide BPRD’s Circular No. 03 of 2018.

Virtual Currencies/Coins/Tokens provide high degree of anonymity and potentially can be used for
facilitating illegal activities. Also due to the ambiguous nature of Virtual Currencies, no legal
protection or recourse is available to any individual in the event of a loss incurred due to any or all of
the following risks:

a) High price volatility as investments tied to Virtual Currencies are highly unstable and are
primarily based on speculations;

b) Failure/closure of Virtual Currency exchanges/businesses due to any reason including action
by law enforcement agencies; and

c) Hacking/security compromises of crypto currency exchanges and wallet businesses as a
number of instances have been recorded around the world where huge amount of funds
have been lost due to the exchange/wallet operations being hacked/compromised.

Further, Fraudsters are also offering pyramid style investment schemes and coins and promising high
returns (similar to Ponzi schemes) to the general public in Pakistan. This can cause significant loss to
the General Public.

General Public is advised that domestic and international payment and money transfer services in
Pakistan are regulated by SBP under the applicable laws. In this regard, no entity is currently licensed
or authorized by SBP to offer money remittance services and products in Pakistan using Virtual
Currencies/ Coins/Tokens. Persons using Virtual Currencies/ Coins/Tokens for the purpose of
transferring value outside Pakistan are subject to prosecution as per the applicable laws.

In view of the above, the General Public in their own interest is advised to be cautious of and refrain
from indulging in activities relating to mining, trading, exchanging, transferring value, promoting and

investing of Virtual Currencies/Coins/Tokens to avoid any potential financial loss and legal
implications.

State Bank of Pakistan and Karandaaz Pakistan to work together for
Regulatory Framework on Digital Banks in Pakistan

State Bank of Pakistan and Karandaaz signed an agreement in Islamabad today under which
Karandaaz will support State Bank’s efforts to create an enabling environment based on international
best practices for digital banks. Karandaaz will provide technical assistance to the State Bank of
Pakistan for formulating legal and regulatory framework including licensing criteria for digital banks in
Pakistan. The agreement was signed by Syed Irfan Ali, Executive Director, State Bank of Pakistan and
CEO Karandaaz, Ali Sarfraz. Mr. Riaz Riazuddin, Deputy Governor State Bank of Pakistan, dignitaries
from SAARC countries currently in Islamabad to attend the SAARC Finance Forum 2018, and other
senior officials witnessed the signing ceremony.

Improving the efficiency, effectiveness and fairness of the banking system through strengthening and
streamlining the regulatory and supervisory framework are amongst the six main goals of State Bank
of Pakistan’s Vision 2020. The banking sector and market players at present need regulatory direction
to offer services as standalone digital banks. State Bank of Pakistan is already working to introduce a
separate category of banking services through promulgation of a framework for digital banks in
Pakistan. The output of this engagement will be comprehensive recommendations for formulation of
the regulatory framework, including licensing criteria and any amendments required in existing legal
frameworks for the advent of digital banks in Pakistan.

Speaking at the occasion, Syed Irfan Ali, Executive Director State Bank said, “In Pakistan, more than 90
percent of the population has access to most affordable ICT services in the world. The consumers’ use
of electronic payments in Pakistan has grown significantly in recent years. This trend will accelerate in
coming years due to the vision of State Bank of Pakistan on provision of digital financial services,
especially to financially excluded segment of population.”

While speaking at the occasion Mr. Ali Sarfraz, CEO Karandaaz said, “The technical assistance will
include extensive review of existing laws, rules & regulations and international best practices on
regulatory frameworks for digital banks. Extensive consultations will be held with the industry
players for developing a robust and conducive regulatory regime for digital banks.”

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is incorporated under the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956, which
gives the Bank the authority to function as the central bank of the country. The SBP Act mandates the
Bank to regulate the monetary and credit system of Pakistan and to foster its growth in the best
national interest with a view to securing monetary stability and fuller utilization of the country’s
productive resources.

Karandaaz Pakistan, promotes access to finance for small and medium businesses through a
commercially-directed investment platform, and financial inclusion of individuals by enabling digital
financial services. The company has financial and institutional support from the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).

Monetary Policy Statement
July 14, 2018

Pakistan has achieved a thirteen-year high growth rate of 5.8 percent in FY18 and the average CPI
inflation was well below the 6.0 percent target. However, moving forward, the challenges to
Pakistan’s economy have further accentuated. First, the provisional SBP estimate for fiscal deficit in
FY18 is 6.8 percent as opposed to 5.5 percent estimated in May 2018. The current account deficit
has also increased to $ 16.0 billion during Jul-May FY18 as opposed to $ 11.1 billion in the
corresponding period last year. This means that aggregate demand has proved to be higher than
previously thought. Second, June (YoY) inflation clocked in at 5.2 percent, and the average headline
inflation for FY19 is expected to cross the 6.0 percent annual target. Core inflation numbers and
their one-year ahead projections at around 7.0 percent also reflect demand pressures. Third, on the
external front, though both exports and workers’ remittances are performing better, the sheer size of
imports continues to pressurize FX reserves.

The real economic activity repeated its strong FY17 performance. However, towards the end of
FY18, some challenges cast shadows on the capacity of the real sector to continue treading this high
growth path. In the agriculture sector, the most important concern is shortage of water, which is
likely to constrain agriculture production below the target in FY19. The manufacturing sector is also
poised to show a mixed picture owing to high base-effect, the on-going monetary tightening and
some sector specific issues whereas construction allied industries are likely to perform at pat. Taking
stock of these developments and the spillover on the services sector, SBP projects FY19 GDP
growth to be around 5.5 percent as compared to the annual target of 6.2 percent.

Turning to CPI, the average headline inflation for FY18 stands at 3.9 percent. However, this picture
is changing rapidly as is visible from rising (YoY) headline and core inflation for June 2018 at 5.2
and 7.1 percent, respectively. Based on these recent estimates, SBP’s model-based range for average
CPI inflation is 6.0—7.0 percent for FY19. This assessment relies on: (i) higher fiscal deficit; (ii) food
inflation reverting to its normal behavior; (iii) unfavorable trend in international oil prices; (iv) lagged
pass-through of rupee depreciation; and (v) high survey-based measures of inflation expectations
captured by July 2018 edition of IBA-SBP’s Consumer Confidence Survey.

Monetary expansion in FY18 has been driven by government borrowing for budgetary support and
healthy growth in credit to the private sector. Despite some slowdown in fixed investment and
particular issues of the sugar and fertilizer sectors, stock of private sector borrowing increased by
Rs.768 billion in FY18 which translates into a growth of 14.8 percent. In FY19, private sector credit
is expected to increase by almost the same amount at a growth rate of about 13.0 percent. This will
be driven primarily by the rise in need for working capital at the back of gestation of lagged fixed
investment into production and rising exports. The expansionary impact of net domestic assets
(NDA) on broad money supply has been partially neutralized by net contraction in foreign assets of
the banking sector. NFA saw a net contraction of Rs.793 billion i.e. a negative impact of 5.4
percentage points on broad money growth during FY18. As a result, broad money supply saw a net
expansion of 10.6 percent during FY18 as compared to 13.7 percent during FY17. Going forward
the opposing direction of NFA from its NDA counterpart can keep broad money growth low in
FY19.

State Bank celebrates 70 years of professional excellence amidst
acknowledgement from cross section of society

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) celebrated its 70 years’ anniversary on Sunday July 1, 2018 with a
number of programs taking place simultaneously at the Bank in Karachi. These activities were aimed
at sharing the 70 years’ history of SBP and bridging the information gap on various functions and
achievements of SBP and its subsidiaries. The programs were attended by a cross section of society,

State Bank’s Fresh Currency Notes Service 8877 Receives
Overwhelming Public Response

The SMS service launched by State Bank of Pakistan for issuance of fresh note for Eid-ul-Fitr
2018 attracts a huge response.

State Bank of Pakistan appreciates the interest shown by the general public in its 8877 SMS
service for getting fresh notes for Eid. This service launched on 31st May 2018 has attracted a
booking of around 2.3 million people in a short span of 4 days against arrangement made at
1535 branches in 132 cities as compared to 1018 branches nominated in 120 cities on last Eid-
ul-Fitr 2017. The total booking limit of 2.7 million customers has also been increased this year
by 50% as compared to 1.8 million customer limit last year. The total capacity of this system is
constrained by the number of customers that branches can accommodate on each day and the
store of fresh notes available with SBP BSC which is also linked with the capacity to print.

At present, more than 85% bookings have been issued to members of general public as booking
of this service is available 24/7 hours and it is expected that the system will reach full limit in
the next couple of days. Accordingly, booking would stand closed once the targeted figure of
2.7 million is achieved. Bookings will be gradually closed in those cities where branches will
reach their full capacity utilization. However, the issuance of fresh notes against the already
issued booking codes will continue till the last day of the service June 14, 2018 subject to code’s
validity.

The status of all the branches where booking is still available is continuously updated at the
State Bank and PBA websites. The general public is therefore requested to check the branch
status before sending messages to avoid charges and inconvenience.

It would be pertinent to mention that apart from this SMS service, banks may continue to
provide fresh notes to their customers from their branches and ATMs as sufficient quantity is
being provided to them by State Bank.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 30, 2018

The latest information since MPC’s meeting in January 2018 reveals that the prospects of
achieving an eleven-year high growth rate remains strong with average headline inflation
within comfortable bounds for FY18 and FY19. This high growth and low inflation outcome has
been accompanied by a higher current account deficit. Alongwith a high fiscal deficit, this could
affect medium-term stability of the economy. However, recent adjustments stemming from
greater exchange rate flexibility, active monetary management as well as visible improvements
in exports and remittances are expected to bear fruit for medium-term in terms of sustaining the
growth momentum without posing a risk to stability.

CPI inflation has remained moderate during Jan-Feb FY18, averaging 4.1 percent mainly,
because of subdued food prices and lower than anticipated increase in house rents. The latter
lowered core inflation- i.e. non-food-non-energy inflation, from 5.5 percent (YoY) in December
FY18 to 5.2 percent during January and February FY18. This lowering of core inflation is
corroborated by successive iterations (including March FY18) of the IBA-SBP consumer
confidence surveys, which depict relatively well-anchored inflation expectations. Going
forward, a sticky core inflation along with a moderate outlook of food prices amid abundant
grain stocks and the recent increase in policy rate are expected to contain average inflation well
below the FY18 target of 6.0 percent and close to it for FY19. This assessment takes into account
the lagged impact of exchange rate flexibility and its second round effects (specifically through
adjustments in fuel prices), demand pressures, and volatile global oil prices.

The real sector is progressing well and growth remains on track. Agriculture sector, despite
some shortfall in cotton production, is projected to post positive growth for the second
consecutive year. Industrial sector has managed demand pressures through improved
utilization of existing capacity and continuing additions in installed capacity. Consequently,
despite a late start of sugarcane crushing, LSM posted a growth of 6.3 percent during Jul-Jan
FY18 as compared to 3.6 percent during the corresponding period in FY17. Due to transition of
fixed investment into additional productive capacity and with favorable trend in global
demand, LSM growth is expected to maintain its current momentum in the remaining months
of FY18 as well.

On the monetary front, a relative improvement in financial intermediation, coming from
sustained growth of private sector credit (PSC) is leading broad money (M2) growth. Despite a
small moderation in fixed investment, late start of sugarcane crushing season and lower
production of fertilizer amid excess stocks, cumulative PSC flows reached PKR 354 billion
during Jul-Feb FY18 as compared to PKR 338 billion during same period in FY17. However,
there has been a deceleration in M2 growth in FY18. This deceleration was more pronounced in
recent months due to deteriorating Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system. Given the
favorable economic outlook, growth in PSC credit is expected to maintain its momentum
throughout FY18 and well into FY19. Apart from the impact of NFA, the extent of government
budgetary borrowing from the banking system would also determine the trend of M2 growth in
coming months.

Press Release regarding Defunct KASB Bank

 

Of late, the case of defunct KASB bank is in news again in both print and electronic
media, purportedly based on audit report of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP).

SBP would like to clarify that all the audit observations raised from the office of the
AGP have been duly responded. Although, the AGP observation is still at the stage of
draft para, the entire reporting in both print and electronic media has distorted to give
the impression as if the observation had attained finality. Further, they are one sided
and does not reflect the SBP’s point of view. It is reiterated that the SBP being the
regulatory and supervisory authority of the banking system has legal mandate to
safeguard interest of the depositors and to ensure the stability and soundness of the
banking system. The decision concerning defunct KASB Bank has been taken on merit
and in valid exercise of jurisdiction under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962.
Media is, therefore, advised to refrain from speculative reporting on audit paras that are
yet to attain finality.

Monetary Policy Statement
May 25, 2018

Pakistan’s economic growth is provisionally estimated to achieve a thirteen-year high level of 5.8
percent for FY18. Concurrently, headline inflation remains moderate and is expected to stay well
below the annual target of 6.0 percent.

However, since the last meeting, in MPC’s assessment the balance-of-risks to the sustainability of
the healthy-growth-low-inflation nexus have shifted due to the following reasons. First, the balance-
of-payments picture, despite an increase in exports and some deceleration in imports, has further
deteriorated due to a sharp increase in international oil prices and limited financial inflows to date.
Second, the revised estimate for fiscal deficit stands at 5.5 percent of GDP as compared to initial
target of 4.1 percent for FY18, reflecting a significantly higher level of fiscal expansion than
previously anticipated. These twin deficits- depicting the elevated aggregate demand in the country,
are adversely affecting the near-term macroeconomic stability.

The headline CPI inflation remains moderate averaging 3.8 percent during the first ten months of
FY18, mainly owing to low food inflation. Indeed, the average food inflation, clocked in 1.8 percent
during Jul-Apr FY18, whereas the year-on-year food inflation was close to zero in March and April
2018. This has been possible due to adequate stocks of wheat and sugar along with smooth supply
of perishables. Contrary to this, average of YoY NFNE-core inflation during the last two months
has risen to 6.4 percent, which reflects the building up of inflationary pressures in the economy. A
significant change in the outlook for international oil prices with its impact on upward adjustments
in domestic oil prices, a strong demand, the lagged pass-through of exchange rate adjustments, food
inflation maintaining its current course and the stoking of survey-based measures of inflationary
expectations will largely determine the inflation path in the remaining period of FY18 and for FY19.
Conditional upon these developments, the average inflation for FY18 is projected to remain within
SBP’s model-based range of 3.5-4.5 percent whereas the average FY19 inflation is estimated to be
marginally above the annual target of 6 percent.

Turning to the supply side, the real sector has posted a broad-based healthy growth in FY18.
Helped by strong growth in major crops and a modest increase in livestock, agriculture sector has
not only recorded a notable improvement over the last year but also surpassed the annual growth
target of 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, industrial sector grew by 5.8 percent, primarily because of vibrant
construction activity and notable improvement in large-scale manufacturing. These gains in the
commodity-producing sector along with growing aggregate demand have pushed the growth in
services to 6.4 percent. Keeping in view this strong growth momentum and the upcoming
investments in auto and construction allied industries, the government has set the real GDP growth
target of 6.2 percent for FY19. However, SBP’s assessment of overall macroeconomic picture
suggests that this target is ambitious and would critically depend on managing the growing pressures
on the external account -discussed below, while ensuring that average inflation is contained close to
its target in FY19,

Broad money supply saw a net expansion of only 4.9 percent during 1“ Jul to 18 May FY18 as
compared to 7.3 percent during the same period last year. The monetaty expansion in FY18 is
entirely driven by government borrowing for budgetary support and the continuation of well
diversified healthy growth in credit to the private sector. The private businesses borrowed Rs. 482

Monetary Policy Statement
November 30, 2018

The economic data released since the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting in September 2018
shows that the positive impact of recent stabilization measures has started to materialize gradually.
Particularly, the current account deficit is showing early signs of improvement. However, the near
term challenges to Pakistan’s economy continue to persist with rising inflation, an elevated fiscal
deficit and low foreign exchange reserves. These concerns are also captured in the results of recent
consumer and business confidence surveys.

Average headline CPI inflation during the first four months of FY19 has increased to 5.9 percent as
compared to 3.5 percent in the corresponding period of FY18. This trend is even more pronounced
for core inflation, which indicates growing inflationary pressures in the economy. A disaggregated
analysis reveals that this is due to both, demand and supply side factors. Considering these
developments, SBP projects average headline CPI inflation for FY19 in the forecast range of 6.5-7.5
percent, above the annual target of 6.0 percent. Although the recent decline in international oil
ptices could potentially play a positive role in slowing down the current inflation trajectory the risks
currently remain tilted towards the downside.

Taking a lead from the recent large scale manufacturing data, economic activity is expected to
witness a notable moderation during FY19 — reflecting a short term cost of pursuing
macroeconomic stability. The lagged impact of the 275 basis point increase in the policy rate since
January 2018 and other policy measures is likely to contain domestic demand during the current
fiscal year. Furthermore, initial estimates for major crops, except wheat, are expected to fall short
of levels achieved in the last year. The slowdown in commodity producing sectors is expected to
limit the expansion in the services sector as well. In this backdrop, SBP projects real GDP growth
for FY19 at slightly above 4.0 percent.

On the external front, import growth decelerated to 5.8 percent during Jul-Oct FY19 from 26.3
percent recorded in the same period last year reflecting the impact of recent tightening measures.
Even this growth in imports is mainly explained by an increase in the oil import bill because of
higher international oil prices. Non-oil imports contracted by 4.0 percent in the first four months of
FY19. This, along with a continued increase in exports and workers’ remittances, narrowed the
external current account deficit from US$5.1 billion in Jul-Oct FY18 to US$4.8 billion in Jul-Oct
FY19; a net improvement of 4.6 percent. Despite these positive developments, SBP’s net liquid
foreign exchange reserves remained under pressure falling to US$8.1 billion as of 23rd November
2018 from US$9.8 billion at the end of FY18.

Going forward, there is an expectation of receiving higher foreign inflows from both private and
official sources during the second half of FY19. Furthermore, recent bilateral arrangements
including the deferred oil payments facility would also be available to the market from January 2019
onwatds. The projected decrease in the current account deficit, that could be further supported by
the recent decline in international oil prices will instill confidence in the foreign exchange market.
These developments would help reduce pressures on SBP’s net liquid foreign exchange reserves.

Asset quality of the banking sector improves in Q4CY17, says the 4 QPR of the Banking

Sector

The Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) of the Banking Sector for the quarter ended 31*
December, 2017 has been released by SBP today. As highlighted in the report, improving asset
quality, stable liquidity, robust solvency and slow pick-up in private sector advances are the key
developments during the 4 quarter of CY17.

As per trend, asset base of the banking sector has expanded by 4.5 percent in Q4CY17. The
promising demand from textile and cement sectors have improved gross advances (domestic) to
private sector (by 7.3 percent QoQ and 16.4 percent YoY), despite retirements in chemical and
pharmaceuticals. Banks have mostly invested in short-term MTBs while investments in PIBs and
Sukuk have declined. Moderate growth in deposits and higher inter-bank borrowings have
supported the funding needs of the banks.

Besides steady performance, the risk profile of the banking sector has remained satisfactory amid
moderation in profitability. Asset quality has improved as the Non Performing Loans (NPLs) to
gross loans (infection) ratio, recorded at 8.4 percent as of end December 2017, has touched the
lowest level in a decade. The banking sector has earned profits (before tax) of PKR 266.8 billion
during Oct-Dec, 2017 (ROA of 1.6 percent and ROE of 19.5 percent). Encouragingly, Net
Interest Income (NII) has improved; thanks to high growth in advances since the last few years.
The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the banking sector has improved to 15.8 percent, which
is, well above the minimum required CAR of 11.275 percent.

PKR-USS Exchange Rate

Today, the PKR-USS exchange rate in the interbank market closed at PKR 115 per USS and witnessed
an intraday high and low of PKR 116.25 per USS and PKR 110.60 per USS, respectively.

Exports and workers’ remittances have posted promising growth rates of 12.2 percent and 3.4
percent respectively during July-February FY18 after showing a decline in the same period last year.
However, the country’s external Balance of Payments position is under pressure due to the large
import bill. This has resulted in a widening of current account deficit which has translated into a
demand- supply gap of foreign exchange. This adjustment in exchange rate remains broadly aligned
with evolving fundamentals on the external front.

As enunciated in the press release of Dec 2017, SBP believes that the exchange rate movements will
continue to reflect the demand-supply conditions in the foreign exchange market. SBP will continue
to closely monitor the foreign exchange markets; and stands ready to intervene to curb the

emergence of speculative pressures.

communication tools would help SBP to keep itself abreast with modern means of communication
and interact with its stakeholders. He went on to add, “SBP communications not only bridge the
information gap of its stakeholders but also promotes credibility and understanding of its policies and
remove uncertainties to the best possible manner.”

The followers can find the first exclusive interview of Governor SBP, Tariq Bajwa, on Facebook and
Twitter pages of the Bank on March 23, 2018 wherein he shares interesting details of his personal and
professional life along with the Bank’s plans.

Chief Spokesman Mr. Abid Qamar in his statement said that SBP will always keep pace with the
demands of modern means of communication and launch of Facebook is one small step in this
direction. “SBP will continue to communicate authentic information about macroeconomic
fundamentals, stability of financial institutions and conduct of policy initiatives through Facebook
account besides spreading awareness on matters of public interest to its audience globally,” he
further added.

Monetary Policy Statement
September 29, 2018

Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in July 2018, Pakistan has witnessed notable
changes on the political front. This has had a positive impact on the business and consumer confidence in the
country as reflected in multiple surveys. The smooth transition between governments addresses the political
uncertainty observed hitherto, but concerns on the economic front continue to persist on the back of rising
inflation and large twin deficits, that are likely to compromise the sustainability of the high real economic
growth path.

Inflation is inching up, particularly from March 2018 onwards. So far, in the first two months of FY19,
headline CPI inflation has averaged 5.8 percent as compared to 3.2 percent for the corresponding months of
FY18, and an average of 3.9 for all of FY18. The jump is even more pronounced in core inflation- a key
measure reflecting the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.

For FY19, SBP’s inflation projections show that the average headline inflation is expected to fall in the
revised forecast range of 6.5-7.5 percent. This assessment takes stock of the following factors: (i) a higher
than anticipated increase in international oil prices; (ii) an upward revision in domestic gas prices; (iii) a
further increase in regulatory duties on imports; and (iv) the continuing second round impact of previous
exchange rate depreciations.

Following a healthy growth of 5.8 percent in FY18, economic activity is likely to slowdown in FY19 as the
general macroeconomic policy mix is focusing towards stabilization. Specifically, the transmission of SBP’s
policy rate hikes by 175 bps since January 2018 is still unfolding. The government is also now pursuing a
fiscal consolidation program and has further announced regulatory measures to slowdown the growing
pressures on the external front. As a result, domestic demand is projected to decelerate in the coming months
of FY19.

The recent monetary and fiscal measures are likely to affect Large Scale Manufacturing. Furthermore, the
latest information shows that cotton production is expected to miss its FY19 target of 14.4 million bales with
downside implications for agriculture sector growth. The ancillary services sector is expected to miss its FY19
target as well. Some positive impact is expected from the contribution of exports led production and higher
fertilizer production amidst depleting stocks and better availability of energy. After incorporating the latest
information on both demand and supply, SBP projects the real GDP growth for FY19 at around 5.0 percent.

The current account deficit continues to pose a challenge. Despite some growth in workers’ remittances and
exports in the first two months of FY19, a notable increase in the value of oil imports has kept the current
account deficit at US$2.7 billion, as compared to US$2.5 billion, in the corresponding period last year despite
non-oil imports declining during the period. Owing to these developments SBP’s net liquid FX reserves have
declined to US$ 9.0 billion as of 19th September, 2018 compared to US$ 9.8 billion at the end of FY18.

Broad money supply saw a seasonal contraction of 1.2 percent during 1st July to 14th September FY19 as
compared to the contraction of 0.9 percent during the same period last year. During this period, however,
Private Sector Credit (PSC) performed relatively better. The main reasons for the continuing growth of PSC
involve: (1) the improved availability of energy; (ii) relatively conducive exports demand amid GSP plus status;
and (iii) the higher working capital needs due to capacity additions in the last three years. Accordingly, PSC
growth is expected to continue, but at a slower pace than in FY18. Similarly, monetary growth is expected to
remain between 10.5 to 11.5 percent in FY19.

Economy is maintaining growth momentum despite external headwinds

 

State Bank of Pakistan has released its First Quarterly Report for FY18 on the State of Pakistan’s
Economy today. According to the Report, preliminary data on key macroeconomic indicators suggest
that growth momentum remained strong in the first quarter of current fiscal year. Several coincident
indicators point to a further strengthening of aggregate supply and demand in the economy.

According to the report, with the exception of cotton, other major kharif crops achieved or surpassed
the FY18 targets. This improvement is supported by sufficient water availability, healthy fertilizer off
take and an encouraging increase in agricultural credit disbursements. The large-scale manufacturing
also experienced a 10 percent high growth during Q1-FY18 — the highest quarterly growth since FYO9.
The performance was encouraging as all sectors, barring fertilizer, contributed positively. This broad-
based growth can be attributed to: (i) better energy availability, (ii) improved security situation, and (iii)
rising consumer demand on the back of higher purchasing power and access to affordable credit
facilities. The healthy performance of commodity producing sectors had a positive impact on the
services sector as well.

The Report highlighted that timely policy support, favorable cyclical movements, low and stable inflation
along with growing confidence triggered an uptick in the private sector credit. In particular, the fixed
investment loans expanded for the twelfth consecutive quarter in Q1-FY18.

The Report also observed the noteworthy rebound in FBR revenues on the back of increased economic
activity. New infrastructure projects, surge in imports, higher consumption of consumer durables, and
increased prices and consumption of POL products significantly contributed to both direct and indirect
taxes. Notwithstanding this performance, the Report emphasized on the need for more concerted
efforts aimed at expanding the tax base.

It also highlighted that the recent significant gains in export growth and foreign direct investment are
welcome developments. However, these gains were not enough to contain the overall balance of
payments deficit. On the back of an expanding economy, import payments far exceeded the
aforementioned positives and the external sector remained under pressure. The widening of current
account deficit along with an increase in economic activity is a recurring phenomenon for Pakistan, and
one that has the tendency of disrupting growth cycles. There is, hence, an urgent need to find innovative
policy mixes, avenues for raising foreign exchange earnings, and realigning policies favoring export
growth.

In brief, the first quarter developments show that Pakistan’s economy is well poised to continue on its
growth momentum for FY18. However, in order to maintain this virtuous equilibrium of high growth and
low inflation in the medium- and long-term, the Report underlines the need to address long-standing
structural reforms in the fiscal and external sectors.

The growth momentum of advances to private sector maintains
its steady pace in H1CY18, says the 1* HPR of the Banking Sector

SBP has issued the Half-Yearly Performance Review (HPR) of the Banking Sector for the 1% half of
CY18. The HPR provides a comprehensive coverage of the performance and soundness of the banking
sector and highlights the key issues facing the financial sector.

According to the report, banking sector has performed reasonably well. The asset base of the banking
sector has expanded by 4.7 percent during H1CY18 (Year-on-Year (YoY): 9.7 percent). Encouragingly,
advances to the private sector have been the key contributor in the asset growth with sugar, energy
and cement sectors along with individuals (i.e. sole proprietorships) being the key borrowers.
Deposits have observed slight deceleration but remained the mainstay of funds for the banks.

The overall risk profile of the banking sector has improved in H1CY18, mainly, due to strengthening
capital adequacy and improving asset quality. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has further strengthened
to 15.9 percent; well above the minimum regulatory required level of 11.275 percent. Non-
Performing Loans (NPLS) to total loans ratio has receded to 7.9 percent—the lowest level since
H1CY08. Banks’ after-tax earnings (Year to Date), however, have declined by 14.7 percent due to
reduced non-interest income, one-off provision expenses, and higher administrative cost.

The report also highlights expectations about macro-financial conditions in H2CY18. The results of the
2°? wave of SBP’s Systemic Risk Survey suggest that external sector pressures, fiscal sector
vulnerabilities, growing domestic inflation and volatile commodity markets could potentially impact
financial stability over the coming six months.

Governor SBP adopts agri. credit target of Rs 1,250 billion for FY 2018-19 with a
commitment to serving small farmers and underserved areas through innovative agri
financing schemes

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Mr. Tariq Bajwa urged banks to bring qualitative shift in
agricultural financing by adopting innovative techniques for provision of easy and swift credit to small
farmers. While chairing the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) he shared that agricultural
credit is one of the top priorities of government. The annual meeting of the ACAC was held for the
first time in Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu & Kashmir as part of the SBP’s continued efforts to enhance
agri credit in underserved provinces and regions.

While reviewing the progress on agri. credit targets of FY 2017-18, Mr. Bajwa, appreciated the efforts
of commercial banks, microfinance banks and microfinance institutions for nearly achieving the agri.
targets. The banks disbursed Rs 972.6 billion, which was over 97% of the assigned target and 38%
higher than FY 2016-17. In terms of agri. credit demand, banks met 72% of the total agri. credit
requirement compared to 57% last year. He added that the outstanding portfolio of agri. credit also
increased to Rs 469 billion while serving 3.72 million borrowers at end June 2018. The agri lending
banks/institutions added 450,000 fresh borrowers during the year.

While delivering his keynote address, Mr. Bajwa highlighted that most of the banks met their
assigned targets; however, banks including ZTBL, PPCBL, some of the domestic private banks and
Islamic banks fell short of achieving their targets. The province wise agri. credit disbursement
witnessed double-digit growth across all provinces and regions; however, banks struggled to achieve
their assigned regional targets in the underserved provinces/regions. He urged agri. lending banks
and institutions to double up their efforts and commitment to ensure achievement of agri. credit
target in the underserved provinces and regions.

He urged the Federal & Provincial governments, revenue departments, farmers’ associations and
other stakeholders to contribute in increasing crop productivity by adopting innovative farming
techniques, providing modern cold storage & silos facilities, implementation of automated land
revenue record and efficient irrigation systems to facilitate banks in their endeavor to adopt agri.
finance as a viable business.

Mr. Bajwa also highlighted that besides providing an enabling regulatory environment, SBP has been
taking various developmental initiatives to boost agri. financing at the grass root level. These included
holding a number of awareness sessions all over the country and job fairs in collaboration with Agri.
Universities in the underserved provinces/regions. The Governor emphasized that all banks should
finalize the recruitment of the shortlisted candidates on priority basis and to take maximum benefit
from the upcoming job fairs being planned by SBP in collaboration with agri universities.

The key note address was followed by a presentation wherein the performance of banks on
agricultural financing was reviewed against their targets during FY 2017-18. While assigning the agri.
credit target for FY 2018-19, it was shared that the overall disbursement target of Rs. 1,250 billion has
been assigned to banks which is 82% of the total estimated agri. credit requirement of Rs 1,519
billion. The province wise and sector wise distribution of the target was adopted while considering

PKR-US$ Exchange Rate Depreciates in the Interbank Market

Today, exchange rate in the interbank market closed at PKR 133.64 to USD against
previous day’s closing of PKR 124.27 to USD. This movement broadly reflects the current
account dynamics and also the demand-supply gap in the foreign exchange market.

Although current account deficit narrowed in August 2018, a consistent increase in oil
import bill on account of rising international oil prices has exerted pressure in the
foreign exchange market.

SBP is of the view that this adjustment in the exchange rate along with lagged impact of
recent hikes in the policy rate, and other policy measures to contain imports would
correct the imbalances in the external account.

SBP will continue to closely monitor the situation and stand ready to intervene in case of
any unwarranted volatility in the foreign exchange market.

Agricultural Credit Disbursement Increased to Rs 972.6 billion in FY 2017-18

Banks have disbursed Rs 972.6 billion for FY 2017-18. The current year’s disbursement is 38.1%
higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs 704.5 billion. Further, the agri. outstanding portfolio
increased to Rs 469.4 billion on end June, 2018 registering a growth of 15.7% compared with the last
year’s position of Rs 405.8 billion. Similarly, the agricultural credit outreach has increased to 3.72
million farmers at end June 2018 from 3.27 million farmers last year recording growth of 13.8%.

The achievement of agri. credit disbursement was a challenging task in the backdrop of various real
side challenges like; water shortage, low production of maize & wheat, price volatility of agri. produce
and high cost of production. However, SBP made concerted efforts for achieving the agri. credit
disbursement target and implementing various budgetary initiatives set by the government. These
efforts included; provision of enabling regulatory environment for agri. lending institutions,
sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing as a viable business proposition, exploring new avenues of
financing; value chain financing, digitalization of credit, warehouse receipt financing and
implementation of credit guarantee scheme for small and marginalized farmers etc.

In addition, SBP has made various initiatives for promoting agri. credit, which include allocation of
regional targets, recruitment of ACOs by organizing job fairs in agri. universities and continuous
follow up with banks for the achievement of the targets. Further, farmer’s awareness programs at
grass root level have also helped in improving agri. disbursement in underserved areas.

The analysis of agri. credit disbursement during FY 2017-18 reveals that five major banks collectively
disbursed agri. loans of Rs 523.9 billion or 101.5 % of their annual target of Rs 516 billion which is
higher by 52.9% from Rs 342.6 billion disbursed during last year. Under specialized banks category,
ZTBL disbursed Rs 83.2 billion or 66.6% of its annual target of Rs 125 billion while PPCBL disbursed Rs
10.7 billion by achieving 71.5% against its target of Rs 15 billion during FY 2017-18.

Fifteen domestic private banks as a group achieved 92.4% against the target of Rs 200 billion and five
Islamic Banks achieved 82% of their total target of Rs 20 billion. Further, the performance of
Microfinance Banks and Microfinance Institutions remained encouraging and collectively these
institutions surpassed their annual targets by disbursing Rs 124.8 billion and 28.7 billion respectively
to small farmers during FY 2017-18.

The State Bank of Pakistan categorically denies the news item circulating in a section of social media
regarding issuance of Rs.10, 000 banknote. The existing banknote denominations satisfactorily meet

the payment, settlement and other allied needs of the economy and thus there is no need for issuing
higher denomination banknotes.

The general public is advised to not pay heed to such rumors and check the authenticity of any news
item related to banknotes on the SBP website and its social media accounts. SBP regularly updates its

website and social media pages and any news item associated with SBP can be verified from these

PKR-USS Exchange Rate

Today, the PKR-US$ exchange rate in the interbank market closed at PKR 119.84 per US$ while
witnessing an intraday low and high of PKR 117.00 and PKR 121.50 per US$ respectively. This
movement is based on foreign exchange demand-supply gap in the interbank market.

The market-based adjustment is reflective of the country’s external Balance of Payments position
which is under pressure due to a large trade deficit. Despite the continued growth in exports (13.3
percent in Jul-Apr FY18) and some uptick in remittances, growing imports have pushed the
current account deficit to US$ 14.0 billion during the first ten months of FY18, which is 1.5 times
the level of deficit realized during the same period last year.

SBP is of the view that this market-driven adjustment in the exchange rate along with other recent
policy measures are expected to contain the imbalances in the external account thereby
containing aggregate demand and _ also facilitate the prospects for generating non-debt creating
inflows.

SBP will continue to closely monitor the foreign exchange markets; and stands ready to ensute
stability in the financial markets and curb the emergence of speculative pressures.

Governor SBP reiterates SBP will continue to play its role for economic stability of the
country

 

State Bank of Pakistan celebrated 71 Independence Day anniversary of Pakistan on 14 August, 2018
at SBP headquarters Karachi. Governor SBP, Mr.Tariq Bajwa, started the formal proceedings by
planting a tree at the Bank premises and later hoisted the national flag amidst thunderous applause
as colorful event commenced with recitation of verses of Holy Quran and subsequently playing of
national anthem. Mr. Bajwa later announced to start a tree plantation campaign across all 16-field
offices of SBP(BSC) spread across the country.

The Governor reminded the nation in general and youth of the country in particular that Pakistan had
not come into being just because of the end of the British rule, rather Muslims of the sub-continent
had rendered supreme sacrifices for its creation under the selfless and courageous leadership of
Quaid-e-Azam, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

Highlighting the importance of the day, Mr. Bajwa said it was heartening to note that the democratic
process is continuing and that the members of newly elected national assembly have taken oath
yesterday, which is a good omen for the country. He was confident that the journey towards
improvement in economic conditions would continue unabated and assured that SBP will continue
providing complete support to the newly elected government within its domain.

Governor felt satisfaction that Pakistan had achieved success on various fronts including economic
progress right after its inception. “State Bank of Pakistan has been discharging its responsibilities as
custodian of country’s financial system,” he added. He, however, conceded that there had been
challenges on economic front.

Mr. Bajwa briefly revisited the long term steps taken by the SBP aimed at improving economic
conditions in the country. These include ensuring price stability through improvement in the
monetary policy framework. “This stability supports economic growth, which in turn could lead to
improved quality of life in addition to preserving the value of saving” said the Governor.

Mr. Bajwa said that the banking sector had registered an impressive asset expansion largely due to
robust growth in advances to private sector. However, he emphasized the need for expanding
banking products for all tiers of the economy, in particular SMEs, agriculture and financially excluded
segments of the society. “SMEs are among priority sectors for their significant role in any economy
but they have largely been ignored,” said the Governor. He said SBP had recently introduced Policy
for promoting SME Finance and hoped it will increase Bank’s lending to SMEs.

Mr. Bajwa said financial inclusion is important for monetary stability and economic development and
for this purpose, National Financial Inclusion Strategy was launched in 2015 that aims to increase
number of account holders to 50 percent of the total adult population by 2020. The Governor also
briefly threw light on Asan Mobile Account and Branchless banking which are expected to help
increase financial inclusion in the country.

Governor SBP asks banks to setup agricultural credit committees for
promotion of agriculture finance

“| would urge the Presidents and CEOs of all banks to set up agricultural credit committees
comprising of all group heads in their institutions and personally head these committees”,
said Tariq Bajwa, Governor State Bank of Pakistan while presiding, the mid-term review
meeting of Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held in Karachi on 31% January
2018.

While reviewing the progress on agricultural credit disbursements during July December
2017, the Governor lauded the efforts of banks in promoting agriculture credit. By disbursing
Rs. 432 billion during the first six months of FY2018, banks have demonstrated that
agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs. 1001 billion will be achieved, he said. Adding
further, he said that due to improvement in agricultural credit infrastructure, the
disbursement trend has turned positive in the underserved provinces like KPK and
Balochistan, however, concerted efforts are required to narrow the regional disparities by
further enhancing the agricultural credit infrastructure. To prioritize agriculture lending, Mr.
Bajwa advised that internal agricultural credit committees would enhance collaboration and
ensure effective monitoring of the agricultural credit within institutions. He also advised
banks to adopt an effective agricultural credit management structure with integrated
reporting lines of agricultural credit teams to make agricultural finance a key indicator of
banks’ performance.

In his keynote address, Mr. Bajwa also took stock of the four key points identified during the
last ACAC meeting held on 25"" August 2017. These included achievement of Rs. 1001 billion
disbursement targets, increasing financial inclusion of small farmers to address their credit
needs, particularly for production loans, rationalizing the markup rates on agricultural
financing to pass on the benefit of historically low discount rate and increasing banks’
footprint in underserved regions and provinces for reducing regional disparities.

The Governor while appreciating the increase in agricultural credit borrowers of banks by
182,000 mainly due to inclusion of borrowers by the Microfinance Banks, expressed his
concern over the attrition of borrowers of five big commercial banks and specialized banks
and advised banks to take corrective measures to increase their number of small borrowers
to achieve the overall target of 1 million fresh borrowers during FY 2018. He also urged
Islamic banks to play their due role in the promotion of agricultural finance by strengthening
their agricultural credit infrastructure and developing innovative products.

Expanding Local CNY Settlement and Clearing Mechanism in Pakistan

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has continuously been taking policy measures to ensure that imports,
exports and financing transactions with China can be denominated in Chinese Yuan (CNY). SBP signed
a Currency Swap Agreement with the People’s Bank of China with the objective of promoting bilateral
trade and financing direct investment between the two countries in the respective local currencies.

In order to further strengthen the trade channels and remittance flows in CNY, SBP has now allowed
Bank of China (BOC) Pakistan to establish a local CNY settlement and clearing setup in Pakistan. BOC
can open CNY accounts of the banks operating in Pakistan, to facilitate settlement of CNY based
transactions such as remittance to/from China. BOC can also provide CNY liquidity to the interbank
market for the settlement of CNY based transactions. It may be recalled that Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) Pakistan has already been allowed by SBP to offer similar
services since 2015.

These steps are part of efforts by SBP to encourage trade with China in CNY and eventually in the
respective local currencies. This settlement and clearing mechanism is expected to reduce costs and
increase efficiency for the local banking system in transacting in CNY, enhance market liquidity and
facilitate settlement of growing trade and investment transactions between China and Pakistan in
CNY. Keeping in view the recent local and global economic developments, SBP expects this initiative
to yield long-term benefits to China-Pakistan relationship in general, and Pakistan’s economy and
banking system in particular.

Clearing Operations for Summit Bank to Continue Smoothly

State Bank of Pakistan has noticed misleading rumors spreading in social media regarding
clearing operations of Summit Bank Ltd. It is clarified that NIFT (National Institutional
Facilitation Technologies), which provides clearing services for banks, has not discontinued its

membership or its services in any way for the Summit bank.

It is pertinent to mention that these rumors stemmed from the notice of NCCPL (National
Clearing Company of Pakistan Ltd.) regarding the bank’s status as a settlement bank to provide
clearing services to stock brokers. Such a settlement bank only processes payments and
receipts of funds on behalf of its broker clients with NCCPL for their sale/ purchase transactions
in stock exchange. Further, these operations do not have any bearing on the other regular

operations, such as deposit taking and withdrawal, of Summit Bank Ltd.

The Bank is discharging its liabilities towards its depositors and other stakeholders in a

satisfactory manner and it’s clearing and settlement function is working smoothly.

State Bank’s Business Confidence Survey

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in its pursuit to improve policy formulation, has been increasing its outreach
to various stakeholders for their feedback for many years now. Specifically, it obtains views of
consumers, businesses and other stakeholders on current and expected economic trends in the country
by directly contacting them through various surveys. SBP, in collaboration with Institute of Business
Administration (IBA), has been conducting bi-monthly Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) of more than
1600 households since 2012 and disseminating its results in the form of a Consumer Confidence Index
(CCI), which are available at SBP website (http://www.sbp.org.pk/research/intro.asp).

Continuing with the spirit, SBP in collaboration with IBA, has also started conducting the Business
Confidence Survey (BCS) since 2017 at a bi-monthly frequency (i.e. February, April, June, August, October
and December). BCS aims to obtain the opinion of firms in industry and services sector about current and
expected business conditions and major factors affecting their businesses. This telephonic survey targets
large firms spread across the country to seek their opinions on production, employment, demand for
credit and economic conditions etc. The survey results are disseminated in the form of a composite index
namely Business Confidence Index (BCI). This index measures business sentiment and is based on six
parameters including current and expected economic conditions, current and expected production/sales
of businesses and current and expected hiring of employees by large scale firms.

The survey provides an opportunity for businesses to contribute directly to the policy formulation process
by sharing their perceptions of current and future economic and business conditions.

In the latest wave of BCS conducted in August 2018, the overall BCI, based on 444 successful interviews,
remained slightly positive at 55. This positive perception of businesses is relatively more pronounced for

Policy for Promotion of Low Cost Housing Finance - Soliciting Public
Comments on Draft Policy

Housing sector in various economies serves as an engine of economic growth. It has the
potential to generate employment, increase productivity, raise standard of living and alleviate
poverty.

Pakistan, like other developing countries, has been facing shortage of housing units; and this
basic human need is felt more profoundly at the bottom-of-the-pyramid comprising of the
poor and financially under-served segments of the society. One of the key constraints
hampering supply of housing units is the unavailability of financing.

In order to address this issue, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in consultation with relevant
stakeholders, has developed a policy for promotion of low cost housing finance in Pakistan.
The formulation of policy for low cost housing is an attempt to resolve issues faced by the
mortgage industry. The policy has been formulated keeping in view international best practices
and local market conditions. Focus of the policy is on regulatory incentives, risk mitigation
mechanism for financial institutions and mechanism to address the issue of affordability for
low-income borrowers.

For soliciting public comments, the draft of Policy for promotion of low cost housing finance
has been placed on the official website of the SBP and is accessible at:

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/2018/Policy-Promotion-Low-Cost-Housing-Finance.pdf

Public comments received within a period of fifteen days will be considered before finalizing
the policy.

The comments should be addressed to:

SBP releases Annual Report on the State of Economy

State Bank of Pakistan has released its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for the fiscal
year 2017-18 today. According to Report, the growth momentum gained further strength as the
economy achieved its 13-year highest real GDP growth of 5.8 percent in FY18. The GDP growth was
also broad-based, as all the three sectors — agriculture, industry and services — contributed positively
to this acceleration, the Report highlights.

The Report states that the acceleration in GDP growth was supported by host of factors, including low
cost of financing, improved energy supplies, favorable business sentiments, fiscal incentives through
subsidies, and increased access to credit. At the same time, higher public spending and progress on
CPEC-related projects stimulated economic activities besides inducing firms to enhance their
production capacities.

The Report highlights that the pickup in GDP growth, however, came at the cost of widening of
macroeconomic imbalances as manifested in a 5-year high fiscal deficit and a record high current
account deficit in FY18. Therefore, the challenge to maintain desired equilibrium of low inflation-high
growth grew substantially which prompted several demand containment measures including monetary
tightening, exchange rate adjustments, and other regulatory measures aimed at curbing imports.

The Report also points out that like previous expansionary cycles in Pakistan the growth in FY18 was
led by a surge in consumption. It further underlines the need for increase in investment to sustain
higher economic growth.

In addition, the Report features a special chapter dedicated to the digitization of services in
Pakistan. The chapter documents the notable developments taking place across three key domains: e-
commerce, fintech and e-government. It makes a compelling case for stakeholders to further facilitate
the advance of digitization, given its potential to trigger investment, financial inclusion, productivity
gains, and entrepreneurship — all of which can, in turn, be a boon for economic growth.

The Report also discusses several aspects of CPEC Long Term Plan related to the development of
agriculture sector of Pakistan. The Report identifies potential areas of improvements in agriculture
along with discussion on how Pakistan stands to benefit from this opportunity under the umbrella of
CPEC.

The detailed Report is available at this link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/annual/arFY18/Anul-

SBP clarifies — except for one, no evidence of banks data being hacked

It has been noted with concern news items reporting that the data of most banks has been
hacked. SBP categorically rejects such reports. There is no evidence to this effect nor has this
information been provided to SBP by any bank or law enforcement agency.

We would like to emphasize that except for the incident of October 272018 in which
reportedly the IT security of one bank was compromised, no breach has been reported.

Nevertheless, SBP has already instructed all banks to take steps to identify and counter any
cyber threat to their systems in coordination with international payment schemes.
Representatives of payment schemes have also assured that all steps are being taken to help
banks in identifying any cyber threat on card systems and have offered additional controls to
them.

In addition to the above, some banks are putting in place further precautionary measures
while others are confident of the security of their systems and continue to make all card
transactions fully available to their customers. The precautionary measures by some banks,
include partial restrictions, such as requiring customers to seek prior approval for use in
cross-border transactions, or in a few banks, a total restriction on cross border transactions.
However, SBP has been assured that all these temporary, restrictions would be lifted once
appropriate IT security measures are in place. It is stressed, that all restrictions pertain only
to cross-border transactions, and no bank has instituted any restriction on domestic
transactions.

SBP is engaged with the international payment schemes, payment operators and banks to
monitor the current situation continuously to ensure security of the banking system.

State Bank’s efforts lauded globally — Voted as the Best Central Bank for Promoting
Islamic Finance*

State Bank of Pakistan has been voted as the Best Central Bank in Promoting Islamic Finance by
a poll conducted by Islamic Finance News (IFN) under REDmoney Group, Malaysia. State
Bank of Pakistan has also won this award in 2015. It is also important mentioning that in 2016,
Pakistan was awarded Global Islamic Finance Award (Advocacy Award) by Edbiz Consulting
Limited, UK. This recognizes the dedication and commitment of State Bank of Pakistan over the
years for laying sound foundations for sustainable growth of Islamic finance industry in the
country. Islamic banking industry has shown significant growth rate since its re-launch in 2002;
by end September 2017, share of Islamic banking stood at 11.9 percent in terms of assets while
in terms of deposits its share is 13.7 percent with a network of 2,368 branches across the country.

“The SBP has demonstrated impressive dedication toward rebuilding Pakistan’s Islamic banking
sector, providing strong support and building deep foundations on which the industry can now
stand”, stated IFN while announcing the poll results. Further, significant measures to support
Islamic banking and finance during 2017 including issuance of detailed guidelines on conversion
from a conventional to an Islamic bank, amendments in the Shariah Governance Framework to
require external auditing, implementing tax neutrality for Islamic transactions and launching of a
new SME finance policy to support entrepreneurship have also been quoted as main reasons for
the award.

Government of Pakistan has also shown strong resolve towards developing this industry. To this
end, formation of the Steering Committee by the Government for Promotion of Islamic Banking
in Pakistan helped a lot in creating the desired harmony among all stakeholders. Subsequently,
an Implementation Committee was formed to execute recommendations of the Steering
Committee. Four sub-committees; namely (i) sub-committee on Legal and Regulatory
Framework, (ii) sub-committee on Taxation, (ii) sub-committee on Capital Market and (iv) sub-
committee on Awareness, Training and Capacity Building, are also working diligently for
promotion of Islamic Banking in Pakistan.

Online Collection of Government Taxes and Duties Launched

The SBP and FBR today formally launched online tax collection system. This will allow the tax payers
to pay FBR taxes and duties using internet banking accounts or ATMs without the hassle of visiting
the banks’ branches. The system was launched by Mr. Haroon Akhtar, Special Advisor to Prime
Minister on Revenue in a simple ceremony held at FBR House Islamabad today. The Ceremony was
also attended by Mr. Tariq Bajwa, Governor SBP, Mr. Tariq Pasha Chairman FBR, Chairman and CEO
1Link and senior officials of SBP, FBR and Customs.

The online tax collection system is live now and the tax payers can pay their taxes and duties from the
convenience of their homes, offices or ATMs at any time 7 days a week. The system is based on the
1Link Biller module, whereby FBR has been added as one of the Billers on the banks’ Bill Payment
page. To pay the taxes and duties, the tax payers/importers will fill their tax and custom duty
payment details in FBR (IRIS) and Customs (WeBOC) to generate PSID (payment slip ID). The PSID so
generated will then be used to access the tax/duty payment details on the banks’ webpage or ATM as
the case may be. The tax payer or their agent will then pay the tax by debiting his/her bank account
for onward credit to the respective government account in SBP. The whole process is online and fully
automated.

On the occasion, Mr. Haroon Akhtar congratulated the State Bank of Pakistan, FBR and 1Link for
initiating and completing this important project. He said that the online collection system provides
much needed relief and convenience to the tax payers and expressed optimism that the business
community will take full advantage of the system and pay bulk of their taxes and duties using the
online facility. He said as the system provides end to end solution right from filing of the tax return to
payment of taxes to recording in government books of accounts and thus will bring efficiency, safety
and transparency in Government tax collection system. He added that the system will also be
instrumental in improving Pakistan’s ranking in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index.

The Governor SBP said that this project is in line with 'SBP Vision 2020', which envisages development
of the robust payment system. The Government receipts and payments being the largest
components of the country’s payment system, the online collection of taxes will have a huge positive
impact on the payment system efficiency and effectiveness. He said that SBP is also working with the
provincial governments to extend the coverage of online tax collection system to the provincial taxes
and receipts as well. He also emphasized the need for automation of government payments and said
that SBP would work with AGPR and other stakeholders to eliminate cheques from government
payments and shift to the Direct Credit System.

The Chairman FBR said that this project is the result of effective collaboration between FBR and SBP
and will go a long way in improving the government tax collection system. He said that tax payers’
facilitation is the core objective of the online collection system. The tax payers and business
community paying taxes online would be able to have confirmation of their tax payments on real time
basis; the importers will be able to get their goods released immediately after payment of the taxes
and duties. He said that the online collection system will run in parallel with the cash/pay order based
system and the tax payers will have the option to use the system of their respective choice and
preference for payment of taxes.

The financial sector has remained resilient despite tightening of macro-financial conditions, says
the SBP’s Financial Stability Review for CY17

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued its flagship annual publication today viz., Financial
Stability Review (FSR) for the calendar year 2017. The Review presents performance and risk
assessment of various components of the financial sector including banking, non-banking financial
institutions, financial markets, exchange companies, non-financial corporates and financial market
infrastructure. It also discusses the possible implications of the assessed risks for the overall stability
of the financial sector.

FSR suggests that the level of overall risks to financial stability, as measured by Financial Vulnerability
Index, has bottomed out in CY17. However, despite tightening of macro-financial conditions, financial
institutions have performed fairly well. The consolidated asset base of the financial sector has
expanded by 12.8 percent during CY17. Asset to GDP ratio has inched up to 74.7 percent in CY17 from
72.0 percent in CY16 indicating higher degree of financial deepening.

On the global front, the review highlights that the pace of global output growth—aided by rebound in
trade and investment—has remained above expectations. The world economy has delivered 3.8
percent growth in 2017 up from 3.2 percent in 2016. However, the review notes that short-term risks
to global financial stability—after receding in 2017—have risen recently in 2018 due to equity market
volatility and trade disputes.

The domestic economy has managed decent growth of 5.37 percent in FY17 and the momentum has
carried on in FY18 with estimated growth of 5.79 percent. However, the economy is confronted with
significant challenges. The foremost being the pressures developing in the external sector because of
widening trade deficit followed by fiscal slippages. Headline inflation has been subdued, though core
inflation has remained at an elevated level.

The rising macroeconomic vulnerabilities have translated into short-lived volatility in the financial
markets (particularly, foreign exchange and equity markets) and impacted the performance of
financial institutions.

The banking sector has registered an asset expansion of 15.86 percent largely due to robust growth in
advances to private sector. The key thrust in financing demand has come from textile, sugar, cement,
and agribusiness sectors. Owing to rise in advances, Non-Performing Loans to Advances ratio—at 8.4
percent—has touched decade low level and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at 15.8 percent is well
above the minimum regulatory requirement of 11.275 percent. Encouragingly, under resilience
analysis, banks are expected to absorb shocks in domestic and global stressed scenarios in the
medium-term. Nevertheless, declining profitability and deceleration in deposit growth are the key
concerns.

The review highlights that Islamic Banks (IBs) and Microfinance Banks (MFBs) are gaining maturity
with improved performance, expansion in advances, deposits and customer base and growing share
in assets of the financial sector. However, IBs continue to face liquidity management challenges due

22nd Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture: The Role of a Central Bank
in National Economic Development by Professor Sir Paul Collier

Creating a shared narrative induces mutual obligations on the part of the public to contribute
towards economic development while introducing constraints on rulers at the same

time. Central banks as a constitutionally independent institution, can do a lot to create this
shared narrative. This was stated by Sir Paul Collier, Professor of Economics, Oxford University,
UK at the 22™ Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture organized by the SBP at a local hotel in Karachi
on February 1, 2018.

Professor Collier, while discussing the capacity of state institutions to tax and to install checks
and balances on the abuse of power, emphasized on the belief of a sense of shared belonging, a
sense of fairness and a sense of purposive action. Without these complementary

beliefs sustained economic development would be hard to achieve, he said. Adding further, he
said that it is imperative to create a shared narrative and inculcate these beliefs among all the
main stakeholders, if a country wants to walk the path of sustained economic development.

Referring to SBP, he mentioned that the recent emphasis of SBP on provision of financing to
underserved segments of the society such as to SMEs, low cost housing finance and
agriculture are purposeful actions in this regard. He also praised the national consensus

on CPEC as a powerful symbol of national unity. He further added that these

actions accompanied by sacrifices of current generations will create trust between the
government and the general public needed for achieving economic prosperity for future
generations.

Earlier in his inaugural address the Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Mr. Tariq

Bajwa, introduced the guest speaker and recounted his achievements in the field of economic
research and policy making. Governor Bajwa also highlighted the role of the SBP in the
development of Pakistan’s economy through strengthening financial institutions, developing
human resources, providing credit to SMEs and other priority sectors and spearheading efforts
for financial access to underserved segments of the society.

Justice (retd.) Mr. Nasir Aslam Zahid, son of (late) Mr. Zahid Husain, first Governor
SBP, also graced the occasion as chief guest. The lecture was attended by former
SBP Governors, SBP Board & MPC members, diplomats, vice chancellors, deans and
students of various universities, presidents and CEOs of banks, and other bankers.

SBP Issues Shariah Compliant Long Term Financing Facility for Exporters

In order to provide Shariah compliant alternative of conventional Long Term Financing Facility
(LTFF) to meet long awaited demand of exporters, State Bank of Pakistan has issued Islamic
Long Term Financing Facility (ILTFF) based on Mudarabah. State Bank of Pakistan since 2008
has been offering long-term refinance facility for plant and machinery through commercial banks
and development finance institutions to allow exporters an opportunity to avail concessional
financing for imported and locally manufactured plant & machinery. However, such facility
could not be availed through Islamic banking institutions in absence of a Shariah compliant
alternative.

ILTFF will allow exporters an opportunity to avail long-term refinance facility of State Bank of
Pakistan for purchase of imported and locally manufactured new plant and machinery from the
eligible Islamic banking institutions. The facility shall be available to the export oriented projects
if their annual export is at least equivalent to US$ five million or fifty percent of their sales
constitute exports, whichever is lower. The period of financing under the ILTFF shall not exceed
more than ten years including a grace period of maximum two years while maximum limit for
obtaining financing under this facility by a prospective customer shall be Rs. 1.5 billion. The
participating Islamic banking institutions shall undertake due diligence process in accordance
with their respective financing policies before sanctioning the facility subject to the respective
prudential regulations prescribed by State Bank of Pakistan for each type of customer.

Islamic banking institutions may participate in the scheme by submitting an application to the
concerned department of State Bank of Pakistan. Under the scheme, Islamic banking branches of
conventional banks may also apply to State Bank of Pakistan for allocation of limit subject to a
maximum of 20 percent of the limit under LTFF for utilization under ILTFF.

This is another manifestation of commitment of State Bank of Pakistan, which has been playing
an instrumental role for promotion and development of Islamic banking in the country on sound
foundations. Due to continuous efforts of State Bank of Pakistan and relevant stakeholders, the
market share of Islamic banking industry’s assets and deposits in the overall banking industry
has increased to 12.4 percent and 14.5 percent, respectively by end December 2017. Assets and
Deposits of Islamic banking industry have been consistently growing with a compound annual
growth rate of over 25 percent for the last 10 years. At present, 5 full-fledged Islamic banks and
16 conventional banks having standalone Islamic banking branches are providing Shariah
compliant products and services with a network of over 2,581 branches spread across the
country.

Use of Chinese Yuan for denominating foreign currency transactions in Pakistan

State Bank of Pakistan, in the capacity of the policy maker of financial & currency markets, has taken
comprehensive policy related measures to ensure that imports, exports and financing transactions can
be denominated in CNY. Both public and private sector enterprises (i.e. both Pakistanis and Chinese)
are free to choose CNY for bilateral Trade & Investment activities.

As per current foreign exchange regulations, Chinese Yuan (CNY) is an approved foreign currency for
denominating foreign currency transactions in Pakistan. SBP has already put in place the required
regulatory framework which facilitates use of CNY in trade and investment transactions such as
opening of L/Cs and availing financing facilities in CNY. In terms of regulations in Pakistan, CNY is
at par with other international currencies such as USD, Euro and JPY etc.

It may be mentioned here that after signing Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) with People’s Bank of
China (PBoC), SBP had taken a series of steps to promote use of CNY in Pakistan for bilateral trade
and investment with China. SBP allowed banks to accept CNY deposits and give CNY Trade loans
(http://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2012/FEC4.htm). For onward lending the proceeds of CSA, SBP has put
in place the loan mechanism for banks to get the CNY financing from SBP for onward lending to
importers and exporters having underlying trade transactions denominated in CNY. The modus
operandi of this liquidity facility for banks is already explained in SBP Circular No 9 of 2013
(http://www.sbp.org.pk/dmmd/2013/C9.htm)

 

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) Pakistan has been allowed to establish a
local CNY settlement and clearing setup in Pakistan enabling it to open CNY accounts of the banks
operating in Pakistan and to facilitate settlement of CNY based transactions such as remittance to/from
China. With the opening of Bank of China in Pakistan, the access to onshore Chinese markets will
strengthen further. Apart from the above, several banks in Pakistan maintain onshore CNY nostro
accounts.

Considering the recent local and global economic developments, particularly with the growing size of

trade and investment with China under CPEC, SBP foresees that CNY denominated trade with China
will increase significantly, going forward; and will yield long term benefits for both the countries.

State Bank of Pakistan Launches Systemic Risk Survey (SRS)

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), being the central bank and banking supervisor, plays a pivotal role
in ensuring stability of Pakistan’s financial system. In pursuance of SBP Vision 2020, it is
committed to strengthening its financial stability regime to identify and manage systemic risks
arising from within and outside the country’s financial system. The assessment of key risks and
vulnerabilities are regularly reported in the flagship annual publication, “Financial Stability
Review (FSR)” and the “Quarterly Performance Review of the Banking Sector”.

In order to augment this assessment, SBP has rolled out a Systemic Risk Survey (SRS) to gauge
the views of market participants and experts about various existing and emerging risks that can
potentially undermine the stability of the financial system. Furthermore, the survey aims at
evaluating the respondents’ confidence in the stability of the financial system as a whole and
banking system in particular.

SRS is a market intelligence tool, used by central banks around the world, whereby feedback
from various market participants and experts regarding their risk perceptions and confidence in
the stability of the financial system is sought. SRS participants will include senior executives of
commercial banks, development finance institutions, microfinance banks, exchange companies,
insurance companies, asset management companies, renowned academicians and
business/economy journalists. It will be conducted twice a year and the findings of this survey
will be used by SBP to strengthen its risk assessment of the financial system and take appropriate
mitigating measures.

The responses to the survey will be kept confidential and will not be shared with any other
person or entity. Furthermore, those will not be used for any purpose other than the assessment
of risks in the financial system.

Widening twin deficits overshadow performance of the real economy

Real GDP maintained its upward trajectory, exhibiting a 13-year high growth of 5.8 percent in FY18.
Benign inflationary environment and improved law and order situation boosted business sentiments,
resulting in higher credit offtake especially for fixed investment. However, this improved economic growth
came amid widening twin deficits, which pose challenges for sustainability of the growth momentum, noted
SBP’s Third Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy released today.

The report pointed out that improvement in the crops sub-sector, especially cotton and sugarcane, paved
the way for agriculture to surpass last year’s performance. Noteworthy contributions from construction-
allied industries owing to CPEC and PSDP resulted in a 10-year high growth of the industrial sector. In
particular, better performance of large-scale manufacturing activity was supported by robust domestic
demand, improved business environment and capacity expansions in some of the industries. Strong activity
in the commodity-producing sectors also led to the services sector maintaining its growth momentum.

The report cited that sufficient supply of key food items, such as wheat, sugar and rice, resulted in subdued
food inflation, which helped to partially offset the higher non-food inflation. The report also observed that
the effects of PKR depreciation on inflation came into play during Q3-FY18. As inflationary expectations
shored up, SBP increased the policy rate in January 2018.

On the external front, the report noted that despite a recovery in exports and remittances, a rebound in global
oil prices, and higher transport and machinery imports led to a current account deficit of US$ 12.1 billion
— the highest seen during Jul-Mar of a fiscal year. Even though financial inflows were higher in Jul-Mar
FY18 than last year, they were still insufficient to finance the current account deficit. Resultantly, SBP
reserves dropped to US$ 11.6 billion by end-March, and the PKR depreciated by 9.6 percent cumulatively
during Jul-Mar FY18.

On the fiscal side, the report highlighted the increase in fiscal deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP during Jul-Mar
FY18, surpassing the full-year target of 4.1 percent. Sharp increase in both current and development
expenditure, largely emanating from jump in provincial spending, amid slower growth in Q3-FY18, drove
the higher deficit. The revenue growth decelerated, primarily due to a slowdown in direct tax collection on
account of lower banks’ profitability and voluntary payments. Factors such as higher external borrowings
and revaluation impact also made matters worse for the government in the face of PKR depreciation.

In sum, the sustainability of current growth momentum rests on effectively managing the internal and
external gaps. On the external front, there is a need to arrange external financing in the short-term, and
resolve structural issues affecting competitiveness in the medium and long term. On the fiscal side, the
rationalizing of expenditures may help reduce some stress temporarily, the reforms are needed to expand
the tax base and enhance the efficiency of the tax system to put the internal finances in order.

PKR -USS exchange rate adjusts in the interbank market

Today, the PKR-USS exchange rate in the interbank market closed at PKR 128.0 per USS against the
closing level of PKR 121.55 per USS of the previous day. This movement in the exchange rates
reflects the demand-supply gap of the foreign exchange in the interbank market.

As noted in the recent monetary policy statement, FY18 ended with a real GDP growth at a thirteen-
year high level. However, this high growth has been accompanied with a notable deterioration in the
country’s balance of payments. Despite a double-digit growth in exports (YoY 13.2 percent in Jul-May
FY18) and a moderate increase in remittances, strong demand for imports (YoY growth of 16.4
percent in Jul-May FY18) have pushed the country’s current account deficit to the levels not
sustainable beyond the short run.

SBP is of the view that this adjustment in the exchange rate along with the increased policy rate and
other administrative measures, would help contain domestic demand in general, and reduce the
imbalances in the country’s external accounts in particular.

SBP will continue to closely monitor the evolving fundamentals of the economy, and stand ready to
ensure stability in the financial markets.

SBP rejects rumors about discontinuation of Rs.5000 banknotes

Apropos the rumors circulating on social media regarding discontinuation of Rs.5000 banknote, SBP
categorically rejects all such rumors and requests the general public to pay no heed to such
disinformation.

It is further clarified that SBP Act, 1956 clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of different
institutions including SBP for issuance, circulation and demonetization or cancellation of banknotes.
Specifically, section 25 of the Act requires a recommendation of SBP Board of Directors before the
Federal Government makes any decision about the demonetization or cancellation of banknotes. The
SBP Board has not submitted any recommendation for demonetization or discontinuation of Rs.5000
or any other banknote to Federal Government or Cabinet. Further, in case of demonetization of any
bank note, SBP announces the same well in advance and provides ample time to public to change the
currency under demonetization process. SBP places all such announcements on its website and
circulates the same through its social media platforms as well. The public is therefore advised not to
pay heed to any such rumors which are aimed at creating unnecessary hype and anxiety. They may
also. verify announcements from SBP Website (www.sbp.org.pk), Facebook page
https://www.facebook.com/StateBankPakistan) and Twitter account before forwarding the same to
their contacts.

Governor SBP encourages stakeholders to strengthen the quantity and quality of credit to
Pakistan’s agriculture sector

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, appreciated the banks for their efforts in
increasing the bank credit to the agriculture sector, which reached its historical high by end of
FY19. ‘It is for the first time in Pakistan’s history that credit to the agriculture sector has
surpassed one trillion rupees,’ said the Governor in his keynote address. He was chairing the
annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held in Peshawar, KPK
as part of SBPs continued efforts to enhance agriculture credit in the underserved provinces
and regions.

Dr. Baqir, however, urged the banks to enhance their efforts to achieve qualitative aspects of
the assigned targets as well in line with the strategic shift and key policy actions taken by SBP
regarding agricultural financing. He highlighted that most of the banks met their assigned
targets except for some of the banks including ZTBL, PPCBL, some of the domestic private
banks and Islamic banks falling short of achieving their targets. The province wise agriculture
credit disbursement witnessed double-digit growth across all provinces and regions; however,
banks struggled to achieve their assigned targets in the underserved regions. He urged
agriculture lending banks and institutions to scale up their efforts and commitment to ensure
achievement of agriculture credit target in the underserved provinces and regions.

The Governor apprised the committee that SBP is considering three policy actions to further
promote financial inclusion in the agriculture sector. First, enhancing transparency through
disclosure of bank wise performance statistics on monthly basis covering agriculture credit
disbursement, geographic distribution, outstanding amount, number of borrowers, and
agriculture credit infrastructure. Second, introducing a comprehensive scoring model for
ranking of banks against key agriculture credit indicators and targets. Third, introducing
incentives and penalties based on performance scores of banks. Dr. Bagir emphasized that
there is a large scope for lending opportunities for banks that support both financial inclusion
and banks’ profitability.

The keynote address was followed by a presentation wherein the performance of banks on
agricultural financing was reviewed against their targets during FY19. While assigning the
agriculture credit target for FY20, it was shared that the overall disbursement target of
Rs.1,350 billion has been assigned to banks which is 89% of the total estimated agriculture
credit requirement of Rs.1,518 billion. The province wise and sector wise distribution of the
target was adopted while considering the provincial agricultural credit requirements, banks’
overall lending capacity and their business expansion plans. It was highlighted that Islamic
banks and Islamic branches of commercial banks have been assigned disbursement target of
Rs.110 billion in line with previous year to help realize the potential of Islamic agriculture
financing. Further, the overall target of outstanding borrowers has been enhanced to 4.67
million with the addition of 650,000 new borrowers.

Monetary Policy Statement
January 31, 2019

Economic data released after the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in November
2018 confirms that the stabilization measures implemented during the last twelve months are
taking hold. Key monthly indicators are showing visible signs of deceleration in domestic demand.
The current account deficit is narrowing, albeit gradually. This, along with an increase in financial
inflows are contributing to reduced pressures on the country’s external accounts. These
developments are encouraging and have served to reduce some economic uncertainty. However,
challenges to Pakistan’s economy persist: (a) despite narrowing, the current account deficit
remains high; (b) fiscal deficit is elevated; and (c) core inflation is persistently high. This situation
calls for continued consolidation efforts.

Average headline CPI inflation stands at 6.0 percent for the first half of FY19, which is considerably
higher than the 3.8 percent recorded during the same period last year. Meanwhile, headline YoY
inflation has shown some moderation during the last two months, primarily due to a sharp fall in
prices of perishable food items and a downward adjustment in prices of petroleum products. The
impact of these developments has also been captured in the recent IBA-SBP’s consumer confidence
survey, which indicates some moderation in households’ inflation expectations. Despite these
positives, core inflation as measured by non-food-non-energy components of the CPI basket has
reached 8.4 percent in December 2018. Going forward, the second round impacts of the exchange
rate movements, upward adjustments in gas and electricity tariffs, and higher government
borrowings from SBP are likely to be offset by the lagged impact of the increase in policy rates and
the fall in international oil prices, on inflation. Accordingly, the projected range of inflation remains
unchanged at 6.5 to 7.5 percent.

The pickup in inflation and the continuation of economic challenges are taking their toll on
economic performance. Real economic activity has witnessed a marked slowdown during the first
half of the year. Large-scale manufacturing, which has strong backward and forward linkages, saw a
net contraction of 0.9 percent during the first five months of this fiscal year, mainly due to a
moderation in domestic demand and some sector specific challenges. Meanwhile, all major kharif
crops have recorded a decline in production from last year’s levels. The initial assessment of the
wheat crop is also not encouraging. Both, the direct and the knock on, impacts of changes in
commodity producing sectors on the services sector, is likely to reduce real GDP growth for FY19 to
around 4.0 percent, well below both the annual target of 6.2 percent and the 5.8 percent growth
realized in the previous year.

Credit to private sector (CPS) saw a net expansion of Rs 570.4 billion during Jul-Dec FY19, which
was almost double the level of expansion during the same period last year. This growth is largely
attributed to higher cost of raw materials (cotton, petroleum products, etc), continuation of
capacity expansion in power and construction-allied industries (especially cement and steel), and
favorable liquidity conditions due to retirement of government borrowing from commercial banks.

State Bank holds special exhibition to celebrate Pakistan Resolution Day

State Bank of Pakistan celebrated Pakistan Resolution Day on 23"" March, 2019 by holding a special
exhibition “Art in Coinage” at SBP Museum, Karachi. The exhibition highlights the work of renowned
artist Mr. Abdul Jabbar Gul as well as history of coinage.

While inaugurating the exhibition, Mr. Jameel Ahmad, Deputy Governor, State Bank said, “it is an
honour for me to speak on this important day in Pakistan’s history when the resolution to create a new
homeland for Muslims of the subcontinent was passed in 1940 at Minto Park, Lahore”. Further, he said
“today we commemorate the efforts of those daring individuals of the subcontinent, who in the face
of adversity resolved to establish a separate homeland. The clarity of their vision and the depth of their
commitment is evident by the fact that Pakistan came into being within just seven years after the
resolution was passed.”

Referring to the exhibition, he said” “this exhibition is unique in the sense that history is told through
art by highlighting the artistry in coinage of Pakistan, which is usually overlooked due to small size of
coins”.

The Deputy Governor drew attention of the audience towards the mural installed on the facade of the
LRC Building in the compound of SBP, terming it as an iconic symbol within the premises of SBP and
appreciated the work done by Mr. Abdul Jabbar Gul, who was also present on the occasion. Mr. Abdul
Jabbar Gul was selected in 2004 to design and install a huge coin mural on the building of Learning
Resource Centre, State Bank of Pakistan. The mural is 18ft high and 24 ft wide containing 45 coins with
remarkable beauty. He completed this remarkable and unique project in just four months.

The exhibition displays models of these 45 coins used in the murals, which were replicated on actual
scale and put up on panels of 3ftx3ft. The technique used in creating murals is of model casting process
whereby design were made in MDF Lasani wood and then molding was done in plaster. Using the “cold
bronze casting” technique in which the bronze powder is mixed with resin to prepare the plaster.

Several periods of coinage starting from cowrie shell to the decimalization of coinage, table of
conversion, design process of coinage and a chronological history of coins of Pakistan from 1948 to

date.

The exhibition was attended by consul generals of Turkey and Japan, dignitaries of the city, State Bank
officials and people from different walk of life.

Monetary Policy Statement
July 16, 2019

1. At its meeting on 16th July 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate
by 100 bps to 13.25 percent with effect from 17th July 2019. The decision takes into account upside
inflationary pressures from exchange rate depreciation since the last MPC meeting on 20th May 2019 and the
likely increase in near term inflation from the one-off impact of recent adjustments in utility prices and other
measures in the FY20 budget. The decision also takes into account downside inflation pressures from
softening demand indicators. Taking these factors into consideration, the MPC expects average inflation of
11 — 12 percent in FY20, higher than previously projected. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to fall
considerably in FY21 as the one-off effect of some of the causes of the recent rise in inflation diminishes.

2. With this decision on interest rates, the MPC is of the view that the adjustment related to interest rates
and the exchange rate from previously accumulated imbalances has taken place. Going forward the MPC will
be ready to take action depending on economic developments and data outturns. Unanticipated increases in
inflation that adversely affect the inflation outlook may lead to further modest tightening. On the other hand,
a greater than expected softening in domestic demand and downward revision in projected inflation would
provide grounds for easing monetary conditions.

3. In reaching this decision the MPC considered the key economic developments since the last MPC
meeting on 20th May 2019, developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for
monetaty conditions and inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC

4. There have been three key developments since the last MPC meeting. First, the Government of Pakistan
has passed a FY20 budget that seeks to credibly improve fiscal sustainability by focusing on revenue measures
to widen the tax base. Adjustments in utility prices and other measures in the budget are expected to lead to a
one-time considerable increase in prices in the first half of FY20. On the other hand, the government has also
committed to cease borrowing from the State Bank that would qualitatively improve the inflation outlook.
Second, the outlook for external financing has further strengthened with the disbursement of the first tranche
associated with the IMF Extended Fund Facility, activation of the Saudi oil facility, and other commitments
of support from multilateral and bilateral partners. The current account deficit has also continued to fall
suggesting that external pressures continue to decline. On the other hand, the depreciation in the exchange
rate since the last MPC has added to inflationary pressures. Finally, on the international front, the sentiment
towards emerging markets has improved with greater expectations of a policy rate cut in the United States.

Real sector

5. Domestic demand is estimated to moderate to about 3 percent in FY19 and GDP growth to 3.3 percent.
While current high frequency indicators point to a slowing in economic activity, this is expected to turn
around in the course of the year on the back of improved market sentiments in the context of IMF supported
program, a rebound in the agriculture sector and the gradual impact of government incentives for export-
oriented industries. Conditional upon the latest available information, SBP expect the real GDP growth of
around 3.5 percent in FY20.

External sector
6. External conditions show continued steady improvement with a sizeable reduction in the current account

deficit which fell by 29.3 percent to US$ 12.7 billion in Jul-May FY19 as compared to US$ 17.9 billion during
the same period last year. This improvement was primarily driven by import compression and healthy growth

Distinguished Lecture Series
‘Pakistan Economy: Macroeconomic Challenges and Outlook’
by Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan

The Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi organized a distinguished lecture on
“Pakistan’s Economy: Macroeconomic Challenges and Outlook,” by Governor State Bank of
Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, at the IBA Main Campus. The session was moderated by Executive
Director IBA Karachi Dr. Farrukh Iqbal, who introduced Dr. Baqir to the audience. Attendees
included members from the academia, corporate sector, media, the IBA faculty, students and

alumni.

Dr. Baqir divided his lecture in three parts: causes of the current macroeconomic challenges
faced by the economy, actions taken by the economic team to address those challenges and
the results to date, and the outlook of the economy. He described two main causes of the
current macroeconomic challenges. First was the growing current account deficit during 2015
— 2018 which in the context of an overvalued and relatively fixed exchange rate led to a
pronounced depletion of the country’s reserves. The second key cause was rising fiscal

deficits and public debt which had put in doubt the country’s credit worthiness.

To address these economic challenges, Dr. Baqir described three sets of actions that had
been undertaken in the following areas: external, fiscal, and monetary. First, a series of
exchange rate adjustments since late 2017 had helped reduce the exchange rate
overvaluation. These culminated in a change in the exchange rate system in May 2019 toa
market-based system so the economic authorities would no longer have to fix the value of
the currency. He clarified that a market based exchange rate system was not a free float and
allowed for the SBP to intervene to address disorderly market conditions. He noted that
these actions had led to a pronounced improvement in the current account which had halved
from its historic high of $2 billion monthly deficit. He also noted that behind the

improvement in the current account deficit was a reduction in imports and improvement in

export volumes even though export values had grown less due to a fall in international unit

The macroeconomic imbalances have impacted some segments

of the financial sector, says the SBP’s Financial Stability Review for CY18

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued today its flagship annual publication viz., Financial
Stability Review (FSR) for the calendar year 2018. The Review presents performance and risk
assessment of various segments of the financial sector including banking, non-banking financial
institutions, financial markets, exchange companies, non-financial corporates and financial market
infrastructure. In addition, it discusses the possible implications of the appraised risks to the overall
stability of the financial sector.

FSR suggests that the CY18 has been a challenging year for the financial sector of Pakistan. The
macroeconomic vulnerabilities emerging from twin deficits and elevated inflation level have
necessitated the stabilization measures that have slowed down the pace of economic growth. The
financial markets, particularly, the forex and equity markets have trended downwards with increased
volatility. Accordingly, the growth of the financial sector has moderated to 7.5 percent in CY18.
Similarly, the financial depth, as measured by financial assets to GDP ratio, has subsided to 73.0
percent in CY18 from 74.5 percent a year earlier. However, the financial institutions and financial
market infrastructure have largely remained resilient and performed steadily during the year under
review.

Among the financial institutions, banking sector has remained resilient, with strong Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) of 16.2 percent—well above the minimum regulatory level of 11.9 percent—and high
fund-based liquidity. Among various factors, rise in rating culture in the corporate sector has
facilitated enhancement in CAR. The financial intermediation has improved with a rise in advances to
deposit ratio to 55.8 percent, highest in the last eight years. Growing advances have helped reduce
the gross loans to NPLs ratio, but other asset quality indicators have slightly deteriorated due to rise
in the quantum of NPLs during CY18. The banks have posted reasonable profits; however, higher
provisioning expense along with rise in administrative cost and one-off extra ordinary expense has
kept the profitability slightly below the last year’s level. Encouragingly, increase in the share of
interest income from financing activity has improved the Net Interest Margin (NIM), which has been
falling for the last 3 years.

The FSR has also highlighted few challenges facing the banking sector. The deceleration in deposit
growth that is continuing over the last few years may pose funding risk for asset expansion. The
concentration of banks’ exposure to public sector, though reduced due to net retirement in PIBs in
CY18, remains significant. Further, the risks related to AML/CFT and cyber security need continuous
attention for mitigation. Encouragingly, resilience analysis indicates that the banking sector has the
capacity to absorb adverse domestic and global stress in the medium-term.

The Islamic Banking Institutions (IBIs) have maintained fast growth trajectory and now constitute 13.5
percent of the total banking sector assets. This growth is, primarily, driven by broad based financing
activity to various economic sectors, with majority of financing extended under profit and loss sharing
modes of Musharika and Diminishing Musharika. While financial health of IBls remains sound, they
continue to face dearth of Shariah compliant investment avenues that limit their ability to effectively
manage their liquidity as well as mobilize deposits.

State Bank Delegates FCY Loan Registration Function

In order to facilitate the corporate entities for raising foreign currency (FCY) loans from abroad and
further improve the business environment in the country, State Bank of Pakistan has delegated the
registration of FCY loans from abroad to banks.

Previously, it was required to register the loans above USD 1 million, with Exchange Policy Department,
State Bank of Pakistan whereas the loans up to USD 1 million were handled by the respective banks.
According to new instructions, the respective banks will register the FCY loans irrespective of the
amount. However, the banks will have to ensure that the FCY loans are in compliance with the relevant
laws and regulations in force.

Further, the minimum tenor of FCY loans, raised by corporate entities for working capital needs
and by the banks for liquidity management purposes, has been reduced to one month.

In order to implement these changes, Chapter 19 of Foreign Exchange Manual has been revised
and circulated vide FE Circular No 6 of 2019 dated December 17, 2019. It is expected that these
initiatives will help the corporate entities to meet their business needs and will reduce their
turnaround time in raising financing from abroad thus promoting the ease of doing business.

The Secretariat of International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) announced on February 11, 2019
that its Executive Council has decided to admit Deposit Protection Corporation (DPC), State Bank of
Pakistan as [ADI Member. DPC is 84"" member of the global body of deposit insurers whose objective is
to contribute to the enhancement of deposit insurance effectiveness and safety by promoting guidance
and international cooperation.

Established in 2002, IADI is a non-profit organization under the auspices of Bank for International
Settlements (BIS). IADI is a forum for deposit insurers from around the world to gather and share
knowledge and expertise. It provides training and educational programs and produces research and
guidance on matters related to deposit insurance (also known as deposit protection). IADI actively
collaborates with international organizations that contribute to financial stability. The cooperation with
these organizations helps to strengthen deposit insurance system.

As a membership of IADI, DPC would benefit through institutional capacity building and greater
interaction with international deposit insurers to learn from their experiences. This will also
complement the strategic goal of “strengthening the financial system stability regime” — one of the
objectives of State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Strategic Plan 2016-20.

DPC has been established as a wholly owned subsidiary of SBP (under the Deposit Protection
Corporation Act, 2016), with the objective of compensating the small and financially unsophisticated
depositors to the extent of protected deposits.

SBP releases First Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its First Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s
Economy for FY19. According to the report, the overall macroeconomic environment remained
challenging during the first quarter of FY19 as suggested by the preliminary data. The primary
concern was the steep rise in global crude prices, which not only reinforced the already strong
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy, but also eclipsed emerging improvements in the
external sector. Fiscal pressures also remained intact as expenditure rigidities allowed only a limited
room for the government to maneuver. Responding to these challenges, the new political regime
immediately announced cuts in development spending, partially reversed tax relief measures, and
also explored avenues to bridge the external financing gap.

According to the report, the 6.2 percent target for real GDP growth seems unachievable with the
policy focus now tilted towards macroeconomic stabilization. The production of all major kharif crops
remained lower as compared to the last season, due to lower water availability, which led to a decline
in the total area under production. Furthermore, crop yields suffered due to subdued fertilizer
offtake amidst rising prices of both urea and DAP. The large-scale manufacturing also contracted by
1.7 percent during Q1-FY19, after recording a healthy growth of 9.9 percent during Q1-FY18.
Noticeably, the output of construction-allied and consumer durable segments, which were the major
drivers of growth last year, decelerated on a YoY basis.

The report highlighted that with the underlying inflationary pressures remaining strong and the twin
deficits staying at elevated levels, the monetary policy continued to move along the adjustment path.
During the two Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings that were held during the quarter, the
policy rate was raised by a cumulative 200 basis points. Besides the persistence of strong demand
pressures, the second-round impact of higher fuel prices and exchange rate depreciation pushed up
core inflation. As for private credit, a strong expansion was observed during Q1-FY19, in contrast to
net retirements witnessed in the same quarter last year. The activity in working capital loans was
more prominent, since rising commodity prices and input costs increased the financing requirements
of businesses.

The report also observed that the consolidated revenues grew by 7.5 percent during the quarter;
however, this pace was lower than the 18.9 percent uptick witnessed during Q1-FY18. Expenditures
grew by 11.0 percent during the quarter compared to 13.5 percent in the same period last year. The
resultant higher fiscal deficit was financed through increased government borrowing from both
domestic and external sources.

On the external front, the report highlighted that the continued exports growth and a steady increase
in workers’ remittances partially helped contain the current account deficit. However, the level of
this deficit remained a concern, as rising oil prices resulted in the quarterly import bill crossing the
USS 4.0 billion mark. With foreign investments declining on a YoY basis and external borrowing by
the private sector remaining subdued, the financial inflows proved insufficient. Resultantly, pressure
on the balance of payments continued to mount, with the country’s FX reserves declining by USS 1.4
billion and the PKR depreciating by 2.2 percent during the quarter. Nonetheless, financing of the
current account might improve going forward as there is an expectation of receiving higher foreign

SBP Announces Concessionary Financing Facility for Special persons

 

State Bank of Pakistan issued a concessionary Small Enterprise Financing and Credit
Guarantee Facility for Special persons. Mr. Tariq Bajwa, the Governor State Bank of
Pakistan announced this special facility in the 7"" meeting of the National Assembly
Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs held at State Bank of
Pakistan. Members of the Standing Committee and senior executives of State Bank of

Pakistan were also present on the occasion.

“Realizing the vulnerability of persons with disabilities in the country and cost
associated with their exclusion for the economy, SBP in-line with its priority sector
development has devised a scheme for special persons”, said Tariq Bajwa. This
financing facility is expected to improve access to finance for special persons falling
under Small Enterprise (SE) category at a concessional rate of 5% per annum. Under
the scheme, banks and DFls will provide financing facilities to special persons for
establishing new business enterprises or for expansion of existing businesses. State
Bank of Pakistan will provide refinance to banks/ DFIs up to 100% of finance extended
by them. Special persons can avail financing up to Rs 1.5 million for a maximum period
of 5 years including grace period of 6 months. SBP will also provide risk coverage of
60% to banks/ DFIs on their outstanding loans under the scheme. This financing facility
has been issued with the main objective of improving the socio-economic life of special

persons in Pakistan.

SME finance by banking industry achieves historic high of over half-a-trillion rupees

SME financing by banks in Pakistan has first time crossed the milestone of Rs 500 billion. SME
financing was recorded at Rs 513 billion at the end of CY 2018 compared to Rs 450 billion in
the corresponding period last year, exhibiting growth of 14 percent. The growth in SME
financing was even more prominent in the last six months of CY 2018 (July-Dec, 2018) wherein
it registered an increase of 25 percent.

This increase in SME financing attracts greater significance keeping in view the fact that SBP
policy rate during CY 2018 witnessed a rising trend. Due to continued focus of State Bank for
facilitating SMEs access to formal sources of finance, SME financing increased significantly
during CY 2018. The substantial increase in SME financing is mainly attributable to
implementation of the policy for promotion of SME finance issued by the State Bank of
Pakistan in December 2017.

The SME policy ensured provision of enabling regulatory environment for SME finance,
prescribing SME financing targets for banks/DFls, sensitizing banks to adopt SME financing as
a viable business proposition, advising banks to provide non-financial advisory services for
making SMEs bankable, simplifying procedures for SME financing and introduction of new SBP
refinance schemes for SMEs through banks/DFls. Under the policy so far more than 2,500
bankers have been trained through focused trainings by the training institute of the central
bank. Similarly, awareness has also been created among more than 20,000 stakeholders
including SMEs through special programs held by SBP and SBP BSC all across the country.

The impact of SBP interventions resulted into significant rise in outstanding SME finance by
banks/DFls coupled with 2.3 percent decrease in non-performing SME portfolio of banks over
last year. It is pertinent to mention that Government of Pakistan is also providing all out
support to promote SME sector. The substantial tax incentives to the banks on their
incremental financing to SMEs announced in recent economic reforms bill is in line with
measures identified in government’s 100-day agenda for development of SME sector. This will
continue to encourage banks to fulfill the financing needs of SMEs.

It is worth mentioning that SME sector is contributing 30 percent towards country’s GDP,
employ more than 80 percent of non-agricultural workforce and generate 25 percent in export
earnings. Thus, SME sector has huge potential for employment generation and poverty
alleviation.

State Bank conducts awareness campaign on SME finance
in Sialkot, Gujranwala and Gujrat

State Bank of Pakistan has completed its four-day SME finance awareness campaign in
Sialkot, Gujranwala and Gujrat from March 13 to March 16, 2019 wherein meetings and
interactions were held with over 2,000 representatives of various SME clusters. Over 300
senior bankers including regional & zonal heads of the banks participated in these
programmes. Seven separate sessions were held in these cities whereas a large SME Finance
Mela was organized in Gujranwala in coordination with Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce
and Small & Medium Enterprises Development Authority.

In the inaugural session of the Mela, President Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce
addressed the participants and assured full support of the chamber for continuing
awareness programmes on SBP’s policies for SMEs.

In his key note address, Syed Samar Hasnain, Executive Director, State Bank of Pakistan,
informed the participants that the distinct feature of the Mela is that the banks offering
various SME products get connected with the SMEs desirous of availing financing facilities.
On-spot solutions to the problems being faced by participating SMEs were provided to them
in the Mela. Number of banks showed their interest in providing SME finance. Banks also
showed their interest in visiting Wazirabad Cutlery market to workout financing solutions for
over 900 SME vendors working in that market.

It may be recalled that State Bank of Pakistan conducted the awareness campaign because
lack of awareness on the part of SMEs was found as a key reason due to which SMEs could
not avail financing facilities available under SBP SME Finance Policy or SBP’s subsidized
refinance facilities. In order to improve awareness, banks have already been urged to provide
details of such facilities to the SMEs in their areas. The unique nature of the four-day
awareness campaign was that apart from face-to-face meetings with the stakeholders, each
day event was thoroughly covered by both print and electronic media. Day-end media talks
were held with local and national level media channels in the three cities for mass media
awareness at general public level.

SBP hosted SAARC Seminar on “Emerging Trends in Good Governance of Banking Sector in SAARC
Region”

Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan during his inaugural address in a seminar on
“Emerging Trends in Good Governance of Banking Sector” in SAARC countries highlighted the
importance of efficient and robust governance structure in the banking industry for sustainable
economic growth of a country. Besides Pakistan, the captioned seminar was attended by delegates from
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

While addressing to the participants from SAARC member countries at National Institute of Banking and
Finance (NIBAF), Islamabad, Dr. Baqir said that corporate governance is corner stone for the success of
any business entity. However, for financial institutions, the importance of corporate governance
becomes even more critical as banks are highly leveraged entities facing a wide range of risks in their
day-to-day operations. Therefore, the scope and approach to banks’ corporate governance requires a
different and specific regulatory framework not only because of their leveraged business model but
also due to diverse ownership and group structure.

Dr. Baqir emphasized that boards of the banks with more gender diversity or female representatives
and diversified experience in the fields of IT, risk management, finance and economics can play a
more effective role in achieving the organization’s overall strategic objectives. He also highlighted
that concentration of banks’ shareholding to a few families and their nominees on the Boards is
against the good governance practices and may adversely impact the effectiveness of the Board.

Dr. Baqir further added that independent directors play an important role in banks by exercising their
independent judgement and protect the interest of minority shareholders. He also mentioned that
corporate governance practices in public sector banks are generally weak and less transparent due to
likely political intervention in the affairs of these banks. Therefore, there is a need to rationalize the
shareholding structure of these banks to minimize the undesirable role of governments in their
affairs. Remuneration practices of Board members and compliance of AML/ CFT regime are also
significantly important areas where the Boards need to assume enhanced responsibilities to meet the
international best practices.

He also cited few of SBP's efforts such as Guidelines on Performance Evaluation of Board of Directors,
Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk Management Framework, Governance Framework for
Banks’ Overseas Operations, Compliance Risk Management and Internal Audit Function Guidelines
and Streamlining the existing regulatory requirements on remuneration of Boards and management.

In his closing remarks, he suggested that Terms of reference (ToRs) of SAARCFINANCE network may
be revisited to align the same with emerging challenges being faced by central banks in the region. He
further added that expanding business arenas, globalization of financial activities, emergence of new
financial products and increased level of competition have not only opened up opportunities but also
increased the potential risks from such developments. Therefore, such regional forums are very

Harnessing technology platforms is the way forward for enhancing agricultural
productivity- Governor SBP

“| would urge the stakeholders including banks, federal and provincial governments to
harness technology platforms for enhancing agricultural productivity”, said Tariq Bajwa,
Governor State Bank of Pakistan while presiding the mid-term review meeting of Agricultural
Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) held in Hyderabad on 7th February, 2019.

“Holding ACAC meetings at various locations shows our commitment for promoting
agricultural financing in all regions, especially in underserved areas. While, previous meetings
were held in Baluchistan and AJK, we are convening this meeting for the first time in
Hyderabad to provide impetus for agricultural finance in the region”, expressed Governor in
his inaugural remarks. While reviewing the progress on agricultural credit during July-
December 2018, the Governor appreciated the efforts of banks in promoting agricultural
finance. The Governor shared that during the first half of FY 2018-19, banks have disbursed
Rs. 527.3 billion, which is 42.2% of the total assigned target for FY 2018-19, and 22% higher
than the disbursement made during the same period last year. The outstanding portfolio of
agri. credit also increased to Rs. 521 billion at end December 2018 from Rs. 442 billion last
year, witnessing a growth of 17.9%. Moreover, the number of outstanding borrowers also
increased to 3.90 million at end December 2018 from 3.46 million last year, with a growth of
12.8%. The Chair also appreciated the efforts of microfinance banks and institutions in
providing financing to small and marginalized farmers.

Governor Bajwa, pointed out that despite witnessing reasonable progress during FY 2018-19,
the industry still faces various demand and supply side challenges. In particular, he
highlighted the geographical disparities in provision of agri. credit as the disbursements in
KPK, Balochistan and GB which still remain far from their respective targets. Like-wise, banks
were advised to pay special focus on production loans for small farmers. He also emphasized
banks to enhance their outreach in terms of agricultural infrastructure by hiring agriculture
credit officers. The Governor also highlighted the efforts of Islamic banks in achieving a
growth of 80% in disbursement during July-December 2018 compared to the same period
last year, however, their share in total disbursement still remains less than 3% in overall agri.
credit.

Monetary Policy Statement
May 20, 2019

Key developments since the last MPC statement

There have been three notable developments since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
meeting in March 2019. First, the government of Pakistan has reached a staff-level agreement with
the International Monetary Fund for 39-month long Extended Fund Facility of around US$ 6.0
billion. The program is designed to restore macroeconomic stability and support sustainable
economic growth, and is expected to unlock considerable additional external financing. Second,
trends in government borrowing reflect a widening fiscal deficit during the first nine months of
FY19 when compared to the same period in FY18. In addition, a greater reliance on central bank
financing of the deficit has acted to dilute the impact of previous monetary tightening, Finally, since
the last MPC, the exchange rate has depreciated by 5.93 percent to PKR 149.65 per USD, at the
close of 20th May 2019, reflecting a combination of underlying macroeconomic factors and market
sentiment considerations.

Real sector

SBP’s estimates show that economic growth is expected to slow in FY19 but rise modestly in FY20.
This slowdown is mostly due to lower growth in agriculture and industry. More than two-thirds of
real GDP growth in FY19 is expected to come from services. Going forward, some gradual recovery
in economic activity is expected on the back of improved market sentiment in the context of the
IMF supported program, a rebound in the agriculture sector and government incentives for export-
oriented industries.

External sector

The current account deficit narrowed to US$ 9.6 billion in Jul-Mar FY19 as compared to a deficit of
US$ 13.6 billion during the same period last year, a fall of 29 percent. The reduction is mainly driven
by import compression and a healthy growth in workers’ remittances. This impact was partially
offset by higher international oil prices. The non-oil trade deficit declined from US$ 13.7 billion in
Jul-Mar FY18 to US$ 11.0 billion in Jul-Mar FY19 reflecting the impact of stabilization policies
implemented so far. Recent indicators suggest export volumes have begun to grow although total
export receipts have not grown due unfavorable prices.

Despite the improvement in the current account and a noticeable increase in official bilateral
inflows, the financing of the current account deficit remained challenging. Consequently, reserves
declined to US$ 8.8 billion as of 10th May 2019 from US$ 10.5 billion at end-March 2019. The
exchange rate also came under pressure in the last few days. In SBP’s view, the recent movement in
the exchange rate reflects the continuing resolution of accumulated imbalances of the past and some
role of supply and demand factors. SBP will continue to closely monitor the situation and stands
ready to take measures, as needed, to address any unwarranted volatility in the foreign exchange
market. Furthermore, the current level of reserves is below standard adequacy levels (equal to three
months of imports cover). As noted in previous MPC statements, deep structural reforms ate

Governor SBP shares developments in financial inclusion and roadmap with special
focus on gender mainstreaming with Queen Maxima, UNSGSA

Her Majesty (HM) Queen Maxima of the Netherlands in her role as the UN Secretary General’s Special
Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA) called on Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor State
Bank of Pakistan at Islamabad. The Special Advocate and Governor Baqir discussed how inclusive
financial technology (fintech) and digital finance represent a great opportunity to improve people’s
financial lives, while noting it is important to consider and mitigate risks associated with it.

At the outset of the meeting, Governor highlighted SBP’s initiatives, commitment and achievements
for increasing financial inclusion under National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2023. The Governor
also shared with the UNSGSA, the high impact development initiatives including gender mainstreaming
in financial inclusion, creation of Innovation Office within the central bank, establishment of Micro
Payment Gateway (MPG) and regulatory framework for Fintechs.

The Governor said that SBP, being mindful of the rising gender gap in access and usage of financial
services in Pakistan, has decided to launch a policy to reduce the gender gap in financial inclusion.
Accordingly, the Governor presented the draft policy on gender mainstreaming to the UNSGSA, which
aims to introduce a gender lens within the financial sector through identified pillars and specific
measures.

Governor Baqir also deliberated that SBP is exploring ways to encourage innovation for financial
inclusion through fintech by creating an Innovation Office at SBP. The Governor while appreciating the
UNSGSA, for her efforts to promote financial inclusion globally invited her to share her views on both
the SBP initiatives of policy for reducing gender gap in financial inclusion and innovation office.

Speaking on the occasion, UNSGSA Queen Maxima remarked that she was very happy to return to
Pakistan and valued the discussion with State Bank on financial inclusion. She appreciated the progress
made by SBP and Pakistan with respect to financial inclusion while focusing on gender mainstreaming
and digital financial services. The UNSGSA pointed out that Pakistan is in good position for a boost in
technology-enabled financial inclusion and that in the last five years, Pakistan’s start-up tech and
fintech ecosystems have made some notable progress with improving their supporting networks.

The UNSGSA mentioned it could be helpful to establish a pro-poor gateway for the wider acceptance
of micropayment methods, introducing consumers to micropayments on a large scale. She was
supportive of the steps taken by SBP to create a micropayment gateway in 2020. She, however, added
that while resolving technical issues are important, it is more challenging to encourage people in
engaging with digital modes of payment. Adding further, the UNSGSA emphasized that in this regard
inclusion of new players is important, whereby they should not only be competing but participating to
expand the delivery of services as well.

Finally, the Governor and the UNSGSA agreed to continue sharing ideas and follow up on agreed tasks
for promoting financial inclusion. The Governor thanked the UNSGSA, Queen Maxima for personal
commitment and pushing forward the agenda of financial inclusion as a means for achieving inclusive
development.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 29, 2019

Economic data released since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in January 2019
indicates that the impact of stabilization measures continues to unfold. In particular, the current
account deficit recorded a sizeable contraction during the first two months of 2019, which, together
with bi-lateral inflows, helped ease pressures on SBP’s foreign exchange reserves. These
developments on the external front have improved stability in the financial markets, reduced
uncertainty and improved businesses confidence, as reflected in various surveys. Nonetheless,
despite narrowing, the current account deficit remains high, fiscal consolidation is slower than
anticipated, and core inflation continues to tise.

Average headline CPI inflation reached 6.5 percent in Jul-Feb FY19 compared to 3.8 percent
recorded in the same period last year. Meanwhile, YoY CPI inflation has risen considerably to 7.2
percent in January 2019 and further to 8.2 percent in February 2019 - the highest YoY increase in
inflation since June 2014. These pressures on headline inflation are explained by adjustments in the
administered prices of electricity and gas, significant increase in perishable food prices, and the
continued unfolding impact of exchange rate depreciation. Core inflation maintained its 13-month
upward trajectory accelerating to 8.8 percent in February 2019 from 5.2 percent a year earlier.
Further, rising input costs on the back of higher energy prices and the lagged impact of exchange
rate depreciation are likely to maintain upward pressure on inflation despite a moderation in
aggregate demand due to a proactive monetary management. As a result, headline CPI inflation is
projected to fall in the range of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for FY19.

Amidst the efforts to curtail inflationary pressures and reduce the otherwise widening
macroeconomic imbalances, domestic economic activity experienced the brunt of the stabilization
measutes implemented thus far. In particular, Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) declined by 2.3
percent during Jul-Jan FY19 against 7.2 percent growth recorded in the same period last year. The
latest available estimates of major crops also depict a lackluster performance by the agriculture
sector. The slowdown in commodity producing sectors has downside implications for growth in
services sector as well. Similarly, a deceleration in consumer demand and capital investments,
reflected through a cut in development spending and deceleration in credit for fixed investments,
indicates a moderation in domestic demand. In this backdrop, the real GDP growth is projected to
be around 3.5 percent in FY19,

Owing to stabilization measures, the current account deficit narrowed to US$ 8.8 billion in Jul-Feb
FY19 compared to a deficit of US$ 11.4 billion during the same period last year- a fall of 22.6
percent. This includes a notable pace of retrenchment of the current account deficit by 59.9 percent
during the first two months of 2019 over the same period last year. This reduction in the external
balance was mainly driven by a 29.7 percent decline in the trade deficit in goods and services as well
as a strong growth in remittances. The reduction in the trade deficit is in large part driven by import
compression- this decline would have been even more pronounced if not for a rise in oil prices.
Exports, in dollar value, during this period remained flat, however in terms of quantum there has
been a notable improvement. Though still posing a significant challenge in term of its financing, the
natrowing of the current account deficit has translated into some stability in the foreign exchange
market.

State Bank holds SAARCFINANCE Seminar on Internal Audit

State Bank of Pakistan hosted a seminar on ‘Internal Audit: Emerging Challenges and Effective
Practices in Central Banks’ under the aegis of SAARCFINANCE Forum at National Institute of Banking
and Finance, Islamabad during 27-29 March 2019. Besides Pakistan, officials from SAARC central

banks participated in the event.

Mr. Qasim Nawaz, Executive Director, SBP inaugurated the seminar. While addressing the inaugural
session, he stated that until a few years back, business process reengineering was at the core of
innovation in banks. While advancements in technology have further transformed the horizon of
financial services, these innovations are also raising challenges of their own. Adding further, he stated
that the Board and the senior management of State Bank are cognizant of the need to align its
internal operations to the changing environment, and to promote innovation in the financial sector in

a regulated environment.

Agricultural credit target achievements in FY 2018-19

Banks made disbursements of Rs 1,174 billion or 94% against the ambitious target of Rs 1,250 billion
set by Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee for 2018-19. The achievement of agri. credit
disbursement is a sizable performance in agri. lending despite number of demand and supply side
challenges. The current year’s disbursement is 21% higher than the last year’s disbursements of Rs
972.6 billion. Further, the agri. outstanding portfolio increased to Rs 562.4 billion on end June, 2019
registering a growth of 20% compared with the last year’s position of Rs 469.4 billion. Similarly, the
agricultural credit outreach has increased to 4.01 million farmers or 91% against target of 4.42 million
farmers at end June 2019, recording growth of 8% from 3.72 million farmers at end June 2018.

To achieve these numbers, SBP adopted a multifaceted strategy and made concerted efforts for
pursuing a massive agricultural credit target which included; sensitizing banks to adopt agri. financing
as a viable business line, exploring new avenues of financing, value chain financing, mobilizing e-credit,
warehousing receipt financing, implementation of crop/livestock insurance and credit guarantee
schemes for the farmers etc.

The achievement could be made due to the integrated efforts of federal/provincial governments, SBP,
financial institutions and other stakeholders. Further, the efforts included rigorous follow up with the
top management of banks and agri. credit heads and conducting regular follow-up meetings with
regional management were instrumental for target monitoring. Conducting regular farmers’ awareness
& financial literacy programs across the country, initiation of one window operation in KPK and holding
job fairs for agri. graduates in underserved provinces were also helpful. Moreover, the support of SBP
BSC field offices in monitoring the district/regional targets was also supportive.

The detailed credit performance reveals that during FY 2018-19, five major commercial banks
collectively disbursed agri. loans of Rs 653.5 billion or 100.4% of their annual target of Rs 651 billion,
specialized banks disbursed Rs 81.2 billion or 71.8% of their annual target of Rs 113 billion and fifteen
domestic private banks as a group achieved 86.5% by disbursing Rs 211.9 billion against their target of
Rs 245 during FY-2018-19.

Moreover, Microfinance Banks (MFBs) as a group have achieved 98.7% by disbursing agri. loans of Rs.
154.0 billion to small farmers which is 23% higher than the disbursement of Rs 124.8 billion during
same period last year. Similarly, the Microfinance Institutions/Rural Support Programs collectively
achieved 97.1% of their targets by disbursing Rs 34.0 billion to small and marginalized farmers during
FY 2018-19.

Five Islamic Banks as a group achieved 78.8% of their annual target of Rs 50.0 billion by disbursing Rs
39.4 billion which is Rs 23 billion higher than the disbursement made during the corresponding period
last year. Further, in order to mobilize the Islamic Windows of commercial banks for agricultural
financing, the disbursement targets of Rs 50.0 billion were assigned for 2018-19. Accordingly, the
windows of commercial banks as a group disbursed Rs 32.7 billion or 65.4% of the annual targets to
faith sensitive clients during FY 2018-19.

State Bank further facilitates freelancers and pensioners

In order to broaden the scope of business to customer transactions through home remittance
channel, the State Bank of Pakistan has enhanced payment limits against freelance services from USS
1500 per individual per month to USS 5000 per individual per month. The enhancement is mainly
aimed at further facilitating freelancers by allowing them to route their funds through the economical
and efficient channel of home remittances rather than keeping their funds with various online money

transfer companies. It would also help in diverting foreign exchange flows from informal to formal
channels.

Moreover, the transaction limit for pension receipts has been revised to USS 2500 per individual per

State Bank supporting SMEs for setting up business and its growth

To improve awareness about its SME finance policy and refinance schemes, State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) conducted meetings with manufacturers and exporters of cutlery, stainless
steel utensils, water pumps and ceramics belonging to SME sector in Gujranwala.
Representing SBP, Syed Samar Hasnain, Executive Director, State Bank of Pakistan said that
SMEs can avail a number of financial services such as setting up and expansion of their
business and working capital finance for specific sectors.

“All refinance facilities are available for end users at fixed rate of 6% per annum and that
banks are also incentivized to lend to SMEs,” said Mr. Hasnain. He elaborated on recent
measures including enhancement of maximum loan limit to Rs.1 million from Microfinance
Banks, simplification of loan application form and fixation of maximum turn-around-time
with the aim to facilitate small and medium enterprises.

Mr. Hasnain informed the participants that banks have been advised to promote non-
financial advisory services for hand-holding of SMEs. Adding further, he shared that in order
to better serve SMEs the National Institute of Banking and Finance, a wholly owned
subsidiary of SBP, has trained around 2,500 bankers last year.

Mr. Hasnain asserted that SME finance policy along with number of refinance facilities for
the SMEs will pave way to enhance current share of SME finance of 8.5% of the total private-
sector credit to 17% by 2023. He added that number of borrowers is also expected to rise
from current 180,000 to 700,000 by 2023. He informed the participants that to achieve these
objectives, banks have been given targets at national and provincial levels. He stressed upon
banks and SME associations to create regional and national level awareness campaigns.

STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN

 

 

 

Monetary Policy Statement
November 22, 2019

1. At its meeting on 22.4 November 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the
policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC’s view that recent developments have
had offsetting implications for the inflation outlook. On the one hand, recent inflation outturns have been on
the higher side. On the other, the causes behind these outturns have primarily been increases in food prices
which are expected to be temporary. Also market sentiment has begun to gradually improve on the back of
sustained improvements in the current account and continued fiscal prudence. The MPC noted that the SBP’s
projection for average inflation for FY20 remained broadly unchanged at 11 — 12 percent and maintaining the
current monetary policy stance was appropriate.

2. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key developments since the last MPC meeting,
developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and

inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

3. ‘There have been three key developments since the last MPC meeting. One, the current account balance
recorded a surplus in October 2019 after a gap of four years, a clear indication of receding pressures on the
country’s external accounts. Two, the government’s primary balance is estimated to record a surplus in the
first quarter of FY20, a first since Q2-FY16. This, together with the end of deficit monetization has

 

qualitatively improved the inflation outlook. Three, the most recent business confidence survey shows that
businesses expect inflation to fall in the near term suggesting that inflation expectations remain anchored
despite the recent increases in food prices.

Real sector

4. Recent economic data suggest that economic activity is strengthening in export oriented and import
competing sectors while inward oriented sectors continue to experience a slowdown in activity. Specifically,
large-scale manufacturing (LSM) shows gains in electronics, engineering goods and fertilizer sectors and
decline in auto, food, and construction allied industries of steel and cement. The latest production estimates
of major &barif crops suggest that agriculture sector is likely to grow in line with projections although cotton
production is likely to remain below target. In sum, the SBP kept its projection for GDP growth for FY20
unchanged at around 3.5 percent.

External sector

5. The external sector continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the benefits of recent policy
adjustments and other factors. In the first four months of the current fiscal year, the current account deficit
contracted by 73.5 percent to US$ 1.5 billion. This improvement reflected a notable reduction in imports, a
modest growth in exports and steady workers’ remittances. Export volumes, especially of rice, textile made-
ups, leather products, and fish & meat, increased despite weakening external demand. The capital and
financial account have also improved due to higher FDI and continued portfolio inflows reflecting renewed
investor confidence.

6. On account of favorable balance of payment developments, the rupee has appreciated 5.6 percent since
its low in June 2019. These favorable developments have allowed the SBP to begin rebuilding gross reserves

State Bank releases Third Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy for FY19

While Pakistan’s economy moved along the stabilization phase led by demand management policies,
vulnerabilities in the external and fiscal sectors persisted during Jul-Mar FY19, according to the State
Bank of Pakistan’s Third Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy released today. This
implies that the current stabilization agenda needs to be reinforced with deep rooted structural
reforms.

The pace of economic growth slowed down considerably during FY19, mainly in response to policy
measures taken to curb the twin deficits. These measures affected the performance of the industrial
sector and dampened manufacturing activities in the country. Meanwhile, water- and weather-related
concerns, in tandem with the higher cost of major inputs, took a toll on crop production. The weak
showing by the commodity-producing sectors also constrained the output of the services sector.

Moreover, the fiscal deficit deteriorated further, as a steep fall in non-tax revenues and a slowdown in
tax revenue led the overall revenue collection to stagnate at last year’s level. On the other hand,
expenditure increased sharply during Jul-Mar FY19, specifically the current expenditure that more than
offset the decline in the development expenditure.

According to the report, inflation stubbornly kept an upward trajectory. Despite several rounds of
policy rate hike since January 2018, the average CPI inflation during Jul-Mar FY19 exceeded the full year
target. Although demand-pull pressures lessened in intensity towards the end of FY19, the Non-Food
Non-Energy component continued to climb due to second round impact of exchange rate deprecation
and increase in energy prices.

On the external front, the current account deficit (CAD) declined on the back of lower import payments
for both goods and services, and a decent growth in workers’ remittances. However, given the elevated
level of CAD and insufficient foreign investments to fill the financing gap, the country had to resort to
bilateral and commercial sources for external financing.

The report features a special section on power tariffs in Pakistan. The analysis explains the process of
power tariff determination in the country and assesses why tariffs have not softened despite the
decline in fuel cost. It suggests that capacity payments constitute the bulk of power tariffs in Pakistan,
and a sharp increase in these payments in recent years has completely offset gains from declining fuel
cost.

The report also contains another special section on the outlook of food security in Pakistan. The analysis
emphasizes the related challenges that the country may face going forward, such as a high population
growth and unfavorable water and climatic conditions, unless remedial measures are taken urgently.

Revision Study for Calculating Effective Exchange Rates for Pakistan

The concept of effective exchange rate , which includes nominal (NEER) and real effective
rates (REER), occupies a prominent place in macroeconomic analysis as it provides
valuable information about a county’s relative position, in terms of competitiveness of its
goods and services for trade, viz. a viz. other countries.

SBP has been publishing REER data on its external website. Since REER is computed
against the basket currencies of major trading partners/competitors, it is a dynamic
concept as trading partners/competitors for each country change overtime. Therefore, the
weights and trading partners for effective exchange rates are revised periodically as a
routine exercise to make the REER more reflecting of latest trading partners.

In this context, using the updated trade weights and new countries, which are provided by
the IMF to its member countries as it has access to extensive dataset needed for calculating
basket weights, SBP has revised the NEER and REER series accordingly. The new weights
are calculated by the IMF on the basis of 2013-15 trade patterns in the global economy. In
case of Pakistan, this update led to increase in number of basket currencies to 37 which
were previously 25 based on 2010-12 trade data. The new weights reflect the change in
trade dynamics for Pakistan. For example, the share of China and other Asian economies
in trade with Pakistan has risen considerably.

To facilitate its users, the data and a brief note discussing the methodology for calculating
NEER-REER indices is placed at links below. The data shows that on real effective basis,
the exchange rate depreciated 15.8 percent between June 2019 and June 2018, slightly
more than the 13.9 percent based on the old series.

State Bank reiterates not to share personal information on fake calls

It has come to our knowledge that fraudsters are attempting to defraud the banking customers by
seeking bank account details on the pretext of biometric verification. In many cases, this is being done
through fake calls by masking the official helpline or registered numbers of banks. The receivers
apparently believe that the call is genuine or from the bank and share their personal information
including bank Account Number, ID, Password, CNIC Number, etc. resulting in loss of funds even during
the calls. The fraudsters generally impersonate as officials of State Bank of Pakistan, Army Officer or
representative of Superior Courts of law, etc. on pretext of biometric verification of accounts. In this
context, public is advised to immediately contact their banks on their registered numbers/helpline
themselves instead of responding the incoming calls and sharing their credentials.

It is informed that SBP/Banks/Micro Finance Banks do not conduct biometric verification of Banks’
existing customers through telephone calls. If public receive any such call, they may share details of
these cases/incidents with law enforcement agencies or SBP helpline at 021-111-727-273 or email at

SBP allows import advance payment facility for manufacturers against LCs

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed banks to make advance payment up to 50 per cent of the
value of imports against letter of credit for manufacturing concerns. Using this facility, manufacturing
concerns will be able to import plant, machinery, spare parts and raw material etc. by making payment
in advance.

Earlier in July 2018, in light of the pressures in the foreign exchange market and deteriorating balance
of payments situation, SBP withdrew the advance payment facility allowed to importers. Subsequently,
some of the restrictions were relaxed to facilitate imports in critical areas related to medicines,
education and defense while most of the restrictions remained in place.

After the implementation of a market based exchange rate system in May 2019, pressures in the
foreign exchange market have eased and the balance of payments has witnessed significant
improvement as reflected in the improving current account balance, rising net foreign exchange
reserves, and other indicators. This improvement in the foreign exchange market after the
implementation of the exchange rate reforms has allowed to SBP to begin relaxing the restrictions that
had been imposed earlier. In November 2019, SBP allowed advance payment up to USD 10,000 per
invoice for import of raw materials and spare parts to manufacturing concerns for their own use only.
At that time SBP also eased restrictions on acquisition of services from abroad, such as consultancies.
The measure taken today will support the manufacturing sector by easing restrictions on import of
plant, machinery, spare parts and raw material, and related items. Today’s measure is in continuation
of SBP’s efforts to reverse the earlier restrictions and facilitate and support ease of doing business in
light of the improved foreign exchange and economic outlook.

Governor State Bank inaugurates conference on AML/CFT & trade-based money laundering

While inaugurating the conference on Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/ Combating Financing of
Terrorism (CFT) and Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor State Bank
stated that significant progress has been made between May and September 2019 to meet the action
plan items set by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in different areas to demonstrate effectiveness of
AML / CFT regime of Pakistan. “There was a major rethink of the approach being taken by the
authorities in early to mid 2019. Consequently, a number of steps were taken to significantly strengthen
our approach to making progress on these issues,” the Governor said. He however, stressed for the
need of putting more effort to make progress on remaining areas to ensure that Pakistan is out of grey
list in the next meeting of FATF.

He was speaking to the conference conducted by SBP and Asian Development Bank today at SBP,
Karachi in a collaborative effort to mitigate the risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism.

Speaking at the conference, the Governor informed the audience that since the grey-listing, State Bank
has arranged many AML/CFT outreach and awareness programs for its regulated entities and
stakeholders and that the conference is a useful platform to understand the AML/CFT challenges being
faced globally and the best practices followed in mitigating such challenges.

In the context of implementing AML/CFT requirements, the Governor urged the financial sector to
make efficient use of technologies for assessment of risks, controls and ongoing monitoring of financial
transactions and enhance capacity by continuous training of their employees.

Dr. Baqir emphasized that trade based money laundering poses complex and sophisticated challenges
and that SBP inspection teams conducted thematic inspections of banks with respect to export and
import of specific goods. He also referred to State Bank’s framework for managing risks of trade based
money laundering and terrorist financing which has been issued to encourage authorized dealers
(banks) to effectively manage the trade based money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

Ms. Xiohang Yang, Country Director ADB, and Mr. Mohsin Ali Nathani, President & CEO HABIBMETRO
Bank also spoke on the occasion. Ms. Yang stated that ‘AML/CFT is a critical issue for trade finance,
which is why ADB’s Trade Finance Program is playing an increasing role in this space. She stated that
ADB has a strong commitment to work with Pakistan’s banking sector and the SBP on this issue.

Ms. Yang further stated that the FATF has identified enhanced capacity building/training in AML/CFT
as an immediate priority requirement and they are pleased to partner with the SBP and thankful to
HABIBMETRO Bank for organizing the same.

Mr. Mohsin Ali Nathani, President & CEO HABIBMETRO Bank while addressing the conference added,
‘Enhancement of AML & CFT efforts through increased awareness and strengthened systems, controls
and processes is imperative for our country and the banking sector. HABIBMETRO Bank is pleased to
organize this conference and bring together relevant stakeholders from the region, regulator and
banking sector to re-affirm our collective commitment to mitigating the risks of Money Laundering and
Terrorism Financing.’

During the conference several prominent speakers and panelists discussed the requisites and
obligations with regard to AML and CFT, including Terrorism Financing Risk Assessments, Transnational
Risks in Trade Based Money Laundering (TBML), risks posed by DNFBPs & NPOs and Ultimate Beneficial

IMF delegation calls on Governor SBP

A delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led by the Director Middle East and Central
Asia Department, Mr. Jihad Azour, called on the Governor State Bank of Pakistan Dr. Reza Baqir today
in Karachi. He was accompanied by the IMF Mission Chief to Pakistan, Mr. Ernesto Ramirez Rigo;
Resident Representative of IMF for Pakistan, Ms. Teresa Daban Sanchez; and Special Assistant to the
Director of the IMF’s Communications Department, Olga Stankova. The delegation also met with
senior management of the SBP.

The Governor shared SBP’s views on the economy with the IMF delegation. He noted that Pakistan
has embarked on its home-grown economic reform program and said that he looked forward to a
continuing fruitful partnership with the IMF and other stakeholders in the international financial
community to support this reform program. He observed that the transition to a market-based
exchange rate system, building foreign exchange reserves, and bringing down inflation were key
elements of the SBP’s reform program to restore financial stability and lay the foundations for
sustainable and shared growth. The initial results from the reform program were encouraging. The
earlier volatility in the exchange market and associated uncertainty had subsided and confidence was
slowly improving. Inflation had risen due to the economic imbalances accumulated from previous
years but inflationary pressures were expected to recede in the second half of the current fiscal year.
Nevertheless, the Governor emphasized that these were the early stages of the reform process and it
was essential to sustain the reform momentum and to keep policies focused on securing stability and
promoting sustainable and shared growth.

In his discussions with the SBP, Mr. Azour shared his views on how central banks in the region were
responding to the challenges being faced by them particularly with regard to capital flows, the role of
technology, and the role of central banks in economic management, amongst other areas. Mr. Azour
looked forward to a continuing partnership with the State Bank.

Banking Sector remains resilient during H1CY19,
says the Mid-Year Performance Review of the Banking Sector

State Bank of Pakistan has issued the Mid-Year Performance Review (MPR) of the Banking
Sector for the calendar year 2019 (CY19). The review comprehensively covers the performance
and soundness of the banking sector.

According to the review, the performance of the banking sector remained satisfactory, despite
challenging macroeconomic environment. Banking sector maintained its growth trajectory
with asset expansion of 5.3 percent during H1CY19 (Year-on-Year (YoY): 7.9 percent), primarily
funded by deposits that witnessed the highest growth since H1CY16. There was some
deceleration in growth in advances—a consequence of economic slowdown. Investments grew
marginally and banks exhibited renewed interest in long-term government securities i.e.
Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).

The overall risk profile of the banking sector remained robust. Though the asset quality
moderated, the earnings of the banking sector improved owing to increase in Net Interest
Income (NII). Resultantly, all profitability indicators showed improvement. The Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at 16.1 percent was well above the local and international minimum
benchmarks of 11.9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.

The review also includes the results of the 4*° wave of SBP’s Systemic Risk Survey, which
represents the views of the market participants.

State Bank releases Second Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its Second Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s
Economy for FY19. As stated by the report, the effects of macroeconomic stabilization measures taken
since December 2017 started to unfold as the economy moved into the second quarter of FY19. More
specifically, monetary tightening along with exchange rate adjustments, reduction in development
expenditures of the federal government and regulatory measures helped contain domestic demand,
which is visible from a marked slowdown in imports. This together with deceleration in external
demand, underperformance of major kharif crops, and moderation in the fixed investment loans, led
to notable deceleration in economic activity. Meanwhile, inflation continued to increase, mainly due
to cost-push factors and some persistence in underlying demand pressures.

According to the report, average headline CPI inflation rose to 6.5 percent during Q2-FY19 — the highest
quarterly inflation since Q1-FY15, when global crude oil prices were around USS 100 per barrel. This
trajectory was largely dictated by its core component, non-food non-energy (NFNE), which further
gathered momentum as the pass-through of exchange rate depreciation and second round impact of
high oil price accentuated its already elevated level.

Moreover, the report highlighted that the fiscal deficit continued to stay high despite a sharp cut in
development spending since the beginning of FY19 and is undermining the efforts to contain domestic
demand. While revenue collection declined, current expenditures increased.

Regarding the external sector, the report observed that there was an improvement in the current
account deficit due to decline in imports and a marked increase in workers’ remittances during the
review period. However, exports were generally affected by a slowdown in international demand.
Also, net financial inflows were lower than last year, leading to a drop in SBP’s FX reserves.

The report contains a special section which evaluates the fiscal burden of state-owned enterprises in
the power sector. Recommended measures include a move towards more effective, apolitical
collection process; investment in the transmission and distribution network; and creation of a national
level consensus towards the formulation of a coherent energy sector policy.

The report features another special section on the importance of human capital in the context of CPEC.
The analysis takes stock of the country’s existing human capital and the employment opportunities set
to arise in the near future as CPEC enters its next phase focusing on industrial special economic zones
and agriculture. It then assesses just how prepared the domestic workforce is to capitalize on these
opportunities, and provides a roadmap to address the associated skill-deficit.

In the big picture, the report underscores the need to step up investments in human capital and
technology. This will boost productivity and increase exportability of the country’s goods, services and
skilled labor, and allow it to generate FX in a sustainable manner.

SBP Instructed Banks to Accept Proof of Registration (PoR) Card as Acceptable
Identity Document for Opening Accounts of Afghan Refugees

State Bank of Pakistan has issued a circular advising banks/DFls that they may accept
PoR Card issued by NADRA (National database & Registration Authority) as identity
document for opening accounts of Afghan refugees. Accordingly, biometric verification of
Afghan refugees holding PoR Card has been made live by NADRA w.e.f February 26, 2019

over the existing established linkage of CNIC verification.

The biometric verification service for Afghan refugee holding PoR card would work
similar to the CNIC biometric verification system. Banks/DFls shall verify the identity of
the Afghan refugees holding PoR Card through NADRA biometric verification system for

opening of account.

Moreover, for services offered by banks to their account holders, where CNIC and
biometric verification is required under AML/CFT Regulations, valid biometrically
verified PoR Card is acceptable as identity document. Banks/DFlIs have also been
advised to ensure compliance of all relevant legal and regulatory requirements including
AML / CFT preventive measures instructed from time to time by SBP for account

opening.

SBP reiterates currency note features to help visually impaired persons

It has come into the notice of SBP that visually impaired persons find it difficult to recognize and
distinguish amongst different Pakistani currency notes.

SBP, for the information of the general public and specifically visually impaired persons, reiterates that
Pakistani currency notes have specific features to help the visually impaired persons to identify the
genuineness of currency notes and to distinguish between different denominations.

All currency notes of Rs.20 and above contain braille features on its front side that help to determine
the denomination of a currency notes. For this purpose, raised dots and small horizontal lines are
printed on the left bottom corner just above the banknote serial number. This feature makes banknote
denominations easily distinguishable by rubbing the thumb against these raised features. The braille
features in each denomination appear in this manner: Rs.20 has one line, Rs.50 two lines and Rs.100
has three lines while other higher denomination notes have dots as braille feature. Specifically, Rs.500
has one dot; Rs.1000 two dots, and Rs.5000 three dots.

All braille features on currency notes of all denominations of Rs. 20 & above are printed through Intaglio
process, due to which they appear raised and on the front side of the note only. Thus, a visually
impaired person can easily infer the denomination of the banknotes by feeling the raised printing as
well as its genuineness.

All Pakistani currency notes have denomination-wise tiered sizing. Each currency note has the same
width of 65 mm whereas lengthwise, each banknote is exactly 08 mm longer than the preceding
denomination. Thus the highest denomination banknote of Rs.5000 is 48mm longer than the lowest
denomination currency note of Rs.10.

The incorporation of a number of strong security features including braille features in banknotes are
aimed at facilitating general public. To create awareness about currency note features among the
masses, SBP provided complete details on its website (available at
http://www.sbp.org.pk/finance/index.asp). Moreover, it has launched Videos and a Smartphone
application on security features of currency notes which provide information on security features of
currency notes both in descriptive and pictorial forms.

It may also be mentioned that 16 field offices of SBP-BSC spread across Pakistan, conduct awareness
campaigns all over the country. These sessions are usually arranged in high traffic areas and involve in
depth briefing on currency note features. To augment the awareness of banknote features, SBP has
mandated the prominent display through posters containing security features in every commercial
bank branch under instructions to guide customers of the currency note features, as required.

Governor SBP Welcomes Change in Moody’s Outlook and Recent Market Developments

Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, welcomed Moody’s change in outlook on Pakistan from
negative to stable. He noted that this positive development reflects the recognition of tough
decisions taken by the economic policymakers over recent months including the step
devaluations of the exchange rate that culminated in the change in the exchange rate regime
to a market based system since May 2019. These steps have made our exports competitive,
curbed expensive imports and given an incentive to domestic industries to compete with
imports, and resulted in a sustained improvement in the current account which has been the
key driver of the increase in SBP’s reserves net of liabilities. The increase in the stock market
is also a reflection of the improving market sentiment and a growing reflection that the
country’s finances are on a sustainable footing.

The Governor also emphasized that while such market developments are welcome, it is
critical to ensure that the emerging financial improvements are translated into real gains for
the middle and lower income classes. These sections of the society have borne the bulk of
the burden of adjustments from higher income taxes deducted at source for salaried
workers, higher indirect taxes, and higher inflation. Rising inflation has partly been the result
of the need to restore competitiveness in the exchange rate, increased administered prices
to reduce fiscal deficits in the public sector, and unforeseen food supply disruptions. The
structural constraints on private investment, as reflected in ease-of-doing business
indicators, have to be addressed further to stimulate private job creation and eventually
raise incomes. Furthermore, it is equally important to address food supply disruptions and
curtail hoarding in food markets to bring down prices. The Governor emphasized that
coordinated work in these areas is critical to ensure that the strengthening market sentiment
translates into improving the livelihood of the people, particularly in the middle and lower
income brackets.

Amidst emerging positive economic trends, SBP is committed
to promote SME finance: Governor Bagir

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, and other senior officials of the Bank met
with senior representatives of FPCCI in Lahore on 7‘ September, 2019 at the invitation of
FPCCI Regional Office. SBP apprised the FPCCI members of its views on the economy and
SBP’s facilities and efforts to promote access to SME finance. SBP also listened to the issues
being experienced by members of the FPCCI in accessing SME finance.

‘The purpose of economic reforms is to definitively address the problems accumulated from
previous years, to bring stability inthe economy, and provide the foundations for sustainable
growth that is shared amongst the citizens,’ said the Governor SBP in his introductory
remarks. Adding further, he said that achieving these goals requires a partnership between
the private and public sectors. Elaborating his views, the Governor remarked ‘Early results
from the reforms are promising: the current account deficit, which was one of the principal
causes of our economic problems, has halved, export volumes have been growing, non-
borrowed reserves have stopped falling and in fact begun to grow, and inflation is projected
to start falling from the second half of the current fiscal year. Governor Bagir emphasized
that sustaining policy reforms and continuing a focus on growth friendly policies is the key
priority going forward.

On addressing SME finance issues, SBP officials explained that its key role in this space is to
provide an enabling regulatory environment through supportive prudential regulations and
to support market development by promoting risk mitigation mechanisms. They also
explained the key pillars of SBP’s Policy for Promotion of SME Finance to the business
community (http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/PolicyPromotionSME-Finance.pdf). Main
features of State Bank’s refinance facilities for SMEs and exporters were also explained in the
meeting. During the meeting, Dr. Reza Bagir highlighted that credit to SMEs increased from
Rs.288 billion in 2014 to Rs.513 billion in 2018. At the same time, he noted, that there is
tremendous potential to expand SME finance and that the relevant stakeholders need to
work together to achieve this goal.

 

Governor SBP also responded to questions of senior representatives of FPCCI and various
chambers of commerce. Mr. Iftikhar Ali Mailk, Senior Vice President SAARC CCl and Mr.
Abdul Rauf Mukhtar, Regional Chairman & Vice President FPCCI thanked Governor and other

State Bank’s fresh currency notes service 8877 receives
overwhelming public response

The SMS service launched by State Bank of Pakistan for issuance of fresh currency notes for Eid-ul-Fitr
2019 attracts a huge response.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) appreciates the interest shown by the general public in its 8877 SMS
service for obtaining fresh notes for Eid. This year service was launched on May 19, 2019 against
arrangements made at 1718 designated ‘e-branches’ in 142 cities as compared to 1535 branches in 132
cities last year. Furthermore, to facilitate maximum number of customers, the total booking limit was
also increased this year to 3 million customers as compared to 2.7 million customers limit last year.
However, the total capacity of this system is constrained by the number of customers that e-branches
can accommodate each day.

Accordingly, the new bookings have been closed as the service has exceeded its optimal limit of 3
million customers. However, the issuance of fresh currency notes against the already issued booking
codes will continue until the last day of the service i.e. May 31, 2019, subject to transaction code’s
validity.

It may also be noted that apart from this SMS service, banks may continue to provide fresh currency
notes to their customers from their branches and ATMs as sufficient quantity is being provided to them
by SBP.

Investment by International Investors in Debt markets

There are several misconceptions about the implications of international investors’ investments in
the debt markets of Pakistan. State Bank of Pakistan would like to clarify as under:

1.

International investors have been investing in Pakistan’s equity markets for a long time. Such
investments are considered portfolio investments, just like investments in debt instruments,
and use the same framework of Special Convertible Rupee Account (SCRA). Such investors
have been able to move capital in and out of our financial markets without problems for the
Pakistan economy.

Recently, international investors have started investing in debt instruments issued by the
government of Pakistan. This is largely a manifestation of their growing confidence in the
positive outlook for the economy. As endorsed by international financial institutions,
including the IMF, the ADB and the World Bank, and rating agencies, our reform program is
beginning to show results. One key aspect of this reform program has been the shift to a
market based exchange rate system since May 2019 which has addressed previous concerns
regarding the sustainability of the exchange rate regime. Together with the continued
improvement in our balance of payments and reserve buffers, this has raised the comfort
level of international investors to invest in local currency denominated financial assets. It
should be noted that interest rates have been higher in the past—for example interest rates
were around 13.75 percent on average in FY11—but our debt markets did not attract interest
from international investors.

Investment in government securities by international investors provides several benefits to
the economy. First, such investment helps to deepen capital markets by increasing the pool
of funds available in the local market and diversifies the investor-base. Second, such
investment helps to allow banks to deploy available funds for lending to the private sector
since there is growing competition from international investors for placements in
government securities. Third, such interest by international investors raises the demand for
government securities and accordingly lowers yields and reduces the cost of borrowing for
the government. Fourth, the growing role of international investors in the local debt market
may serve as a positive feedback mechanism for further improving domestic practices,
policies, systems and institutions in line with international best practices.

At the same time risks posed by such investments are limited at current levels on account of
the following reasons. First, the current level of such investments at $1.2 billion accounts for
less than 2 percent of the total outstanding marketable government securities and less than
0.5% of GDP. Second, this investment accounts for less than one-fifth of the increase in SBP’s
net reserve buffers at current levels; the bulk of the increase in the net reserve buffers is
accounted for by the continued current account improvement. Third, the tenor of such
investments has been increasing with more investments in longer dated instruments as
investors’ confidence grows. Finally, the simplification of taxation for investment in

SBP expands the scope of National Financial Literacy Program to all
over Pakistan

In order to create awareness about the National Financial Literary Program (NFLP) and more
specifically, sensitize the masses regarding the on-ground execution, a dedicated NFLP mass
media campaign is being launched from January 15, 2019 through print, radio and social media.

It is important to mention here that the program launched on pilot basis from August 2017 in 77
districts of the country, has now entered into the second year of implementation. The scope of
the project has been extended to all 158 districts of the country. The education on different
financial themes like budgeting, savings, investments, debt management, consumers’ rights &
obligations, Islamic banking, branchless banking and currency management is imparted through
dedicated half-day class room trainings.

SBP is implementing NFLP as one of its flagship programs to provide basic financial education to
unbanked & low-income strata, especially the youth & women. The program is funded from Asian
Development Bank’s ‘Improving Access to Finance Facility’ and is being rolled-out in different
phases to complete its objective of reaching one million beneficiaries in 5 years, through a unique
public private model, which engages banking institutions and SBP-BSC field offices to impart NFLP
messages in far-flung areas of Pakistan.

NFLP aims to empower public to make better & effective decisions regarding the use of financial
and allied services. Further, it will enhance competitiveness, foster innovations and increase
efficiency of the financial industry to provide better financial services to financially educated
citizens.

A dedicated NFLP toll free helpline and a dedicated website would also be launched from January
15, 2019 to facilitate public in getting information about the program, its features, schedule of
ground iterations or any other information they deem require.

Expansion of local CNY Clearing and Settlement Mechanism in Pakistan

SBP has allowed Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Pakistan Limited to establish their local CNY
clearing and settlement setup in Pakistan. SCB Pakistan can now open CNY accounts of the
banks operating in Pakistan to facilitate settlement of CNY based transactions such as
remittance to/from China. SCB can also provide CNY liquidity to the interbank market for the
settlement of CNY based transactions.

It may be mentioned here that over the years, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been at the
forefront in providing a conducive policy & regulatory environment to encourage the use of
local currencies in trade and financing transactions between China and Pakistan.

Earlier, SBP had also permitted Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC)
Pakistan in 2015 and Bank of China Limited (BOC) Pakistan in 2018 to establish similar local
CNY clearing and settlement mechanism in Pakistan.

The expansion of local CNY clearing and settlement setup in Pakistan is expected to further
improve efficiency of the local banking system in transacting in CNY, enhance market liquidity
and facilitate rising trade and investment with China through fostering competition and
increasing CNY resource avenues.

Treasury Single Account

Some news are circulating on social media regarding government plans to introduce Treasury Single
Account (TSA). While the proposal to introduce TSA is being examined by the Government of Pakistan
in consultation with SBP as part of its agenda to reform public financial management, however, no
decision has yet been made to implement the TSA. Any decision in this regard will be taken after due
consultation with all the stakeholders and assessing its impact on the banking industry. It will,
therefore, be premature to form any opinion about the proposed policy decision and thus the market

players should avoid engaging in any speculative activities based on this proposal which is still under
examination.

SBP consults stakeholders on the new National Payment Systems Strategy

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) organized a workshop titled ‘Digital Payments Reforms’ in
collaboration with the World Bank today at its headquarters in Karachi. The objective of the
workshop was to share the draft National Payment Systems Strategy and solicit the input of
key stakeholders involved in its implementation. The workshop was attended by senior
officials from PTA, NADRA, SECP, FBR, the PM office’s Strategic Reforms and Implementation
Unit, Banks, Telcos, Electronic Money Institution (EMIs), PSO/PSPs and Fintechs. Governor
SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir led the workshop, while Chairman PTA, Major General (Retired) Amir
Azeem Bajwa, and Country Director World Bank, Illango Patchamuthu were also present at

the occasion.

Addressing the workshop, the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, highlighted the issues that have
been longstanding and needed attention of all the stakeholders. The Governor emphasized
the need for rapid digitization of payments in order to realize the full benefits for the
economy as cash is still the preferred mode of payments for our routine and day to day
activities. He noted that the heavy reliance on cash and the limited use of digital channels
reduces economic efficiency, hinders financial and economic development and impedes the
goal of documenting the economy. To address these issues, he emphasized the importance
of building a modern and robust payment system in the country that enables the provision of
cost effective and easily available digital financial services to the general public. This, he

stated is a key strategic objective of SBP.

Governor Baqir shared SBP’s plans for leading an aggressive adoption and implementation of
the National Payment Systems Strategy in the country. He emphasized that interoperability is
key to achieving faster digitization goals. Governor also informed the participants that a new
faster payment gateway will be launched next year to facilitate instant transfer of funds. He
identified government payments and receipts and merchant payments to be the key
elements in accelerating digitization of payments in the country. He also noted the need for

reducing the high cost, especially the interchange fee in the payments industry and

SBP Abolished the Fee on Payment of Government Taxes through ADCs and OTC

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has announced to abolish the fee on payment of government taxes
and duties through Alternate Delivery Channels (ADCs) and Over-the-Counter (OTC) from January 1,
2020. Presently, the taxpayers pay Rs.10 to Rs.50 per transaction for payment of taxes through ADCs
depending on the amount of tax paid, and Rs.50 per transaction for the payments through OTC. This
fee will be borne by SBP instead of taxpayers from January 1, 2020. The change has been notified
through SBP FD Circular No.4 of 2019 dated December 27, 2019.

The decision is part of SBP efforts to promote digital payments and is likely to attract larger number
of taxpayers towards digital payment of government taxes and duties. The mechanism for online
collection of taxes and duties was introduced in March 2018 in collaboration with Federal Board of
revenue (FBR) with the primary objective of taxpayers’ facilitation. The tax payers can pay their taxes
from the convenience of their homes or offices using internet/mobile banking facilities, through
14000 plus ATMs or any of the 15000 plus branches of commercial banks across the country. So far
Rs.346 billion has been collected through this mechanism. The collections through the ADCs/OTC
modes are likely to grow exponentially as the awareness about the mechanism improves.

SBP is also running an awareness campaign to familiarize the taxpayers, tax bar associations,
chambers of commerce, clearing and forwarding agents and business community at large about the
ADC and OTC payment mechanisms. Seminars and awareness sessions are being arranged across the
country through the field offices of SBP Banking Services Corporation. The first such seminar was held
in Karachi on December 26, 2019, which was attended by corporate taxpayers, representatives from
chamber of commerce, trade associations, commercial banks, tax bars and audit firms. The
participants appreciated SBP efforts for promotion of digital payments and said that such sessions are
critically important for enhancing public awareness and allaying their fears and apprehensions about
digital payments.

State Bank of Pakistan allows Electronic Warehouse Receipt as collateral for bank
financing

As a major move towards addressing the challenge of access to finance to farming
community, State Bank of Pakistan has amended its Prudential Regulations of Agriculture
Financing, SME Financing, and Corporate & Commercial Banking by allowing banks to accept
Electronic Warehouse Receipts as collateral for lending against storage of agriculture
produce and commodities.

Warehouse Receipt Financing (WHRF) is a mechanism whereby farmers, traders and
processors may avail financing facility from banks while collateralizing their produce and
agricultural commodities as a security stored in accredited warehouses. WHRF would benefit
small farmers who usually find it difficult to access credit from banks due to non-availability
of agricultural land as collateral. Further, WHR financing would provide liquidity to
commodity market and help in improving food security and price stability.

The State Bank of Pakistan and Government are proactively seeking innovative methods and
measures to improve institutional financing to agri-sector and rural population, particularly
the small farmers. For this purpose, Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), in
consultation with key stakeholders including the State Bank of Pakistan, notified the
Collateral Management Companies (CMC) Regulations 2019 on July 31, 2019, under the
Companies Act 2017 to promote warehouse receipt financing and electronic trading of
agricultural commodities. Under these regulations, any private entity can form a collateral
management company which would accredit warehouses to store agricultural commodities
and issue warehouse receipts eligible for banks loans.

It is expected that the development of a collateral management and warehouse receipt
system would improve access to formal credit, reduce the losses arising from wastage of
agricultural commodities after harvest, increase farmers’ profitability due to better price
discovery and reduce risks of banks by allowing agricultural commodity as an alternate
collateral. Going forward, this system would also facilitate trading of agricultural
commodities at commodity exchanges opening new business avenues in national and
international commodity markets. Further, development of the entire eco system would
encourage investors to set up warehouses of high standards for which State Bank’s refinance

scheme for setting up storage facility is already available.

Monetary Policy Statement
September 16, 2019

1. At its meeting on 16 September 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the
policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC’s view that inflation outcomes have
been largely as expected and inflation projections for FY20 have remained unchanged since the last MPC
meeting on 16% July, 2019. The MPC also viewed that, based on available information, the current stance of
monetary policy was appropriate to bring inflation down to the target range of 5 — 7 percent over the next
twenty-four months.

2. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key economic developments since the last MPC meeting,
developments in the teal, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and
inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

3. ‘The MPC noted two key developments since the last MPC meeting. First, the interbank foreign exchange
market had adjusted relatively well to the introduction of the market-based exchange rate system. The initial
volatility and associated uncertainty in the exchange market had subsided. Reflecting these improved
sentiments and continued adjustment in the current account, the rupee had strengthened modestly against the
US dollar since the last MPC, unlike its previous trend. Second, on the external front, the US Fed, as
anticipated, reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps), followed by policy rate cuts by other major central
banks around the world. This would help in lowering pressures on emerging markets’ currencies and
potentially increase financial inflows.

Real sector

4. Recent economic activity indicators show a gradual slowdown, in line with earlier expectations, and the
MPC continued to expect average growth in FY20 of around 3.5 percent. The slowdown is more pronounced
in domestic oriented industries such as automobiles and steel. This trend is also reflected in the Large-scale
Manufacturing (LSM) index which contracted by 3.6 percent in FY19, somewhat more than earlier
expectations. On the other hand, the MPC noted that the LSM index does not fully capture activity in some
key industries such as high value-added textile products. Export volumes have been growing briskly even
though the growth in export dollar proceeds has been less pronounced due to declining international unit
prices. The MPC also noted that the SBP-IBA Consumer and Business Confidence Surveys conducted during
Aug-Sep 2019 show a modest improvement in the outlook for the economy. The outlook for agriculture and
the services sectors was largely unchanged from the time of the previous MPC meeting. The agriculture
sector growth is expected to improve considerably in FY20 over the last fiscal year while growth in services is
expected to moderate gradually. In sum, the MPC continued to expect that economic activity would gradually
turn around as business sentiment improves.

External sector

5. ‘The external sector continued to show significant improvement with a sizeable reduction of around 32
percent (or 1.5 percent of GDP) in the current account deficit during FY19. The trend continued in the first
month of FY20 as well. Specifically, driven by an encouraging 11 percent growth in exports and a contraction
of 25.8 percent in imports, the current account deficit declined to US$ 579 million in July 2019 compared to
US$ 2,130 million in the same period last year. This, together with the disbursement of program related
inflows and activation of the Saudi oil facility, helped to build SBP’s foreign exchange reserves, which as of
6th September 2019, stood at US$ 8.46 billion. This is an increase of around US$ 1.18 billion from the end-

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has allowed the Authorized Dealers to effect advance
payments up to USD 10,000/- per invoice on behalf of importers cum exporters for
import of raw materials, accessories and spares.

Earlier, SBP had restricted the advance payment facility in July 2018 which was

State Bank of Pakistan has issued three Shariah Compliant Refinance Schemes that are expected to
provide level playing field to the Islamic banking industry. Currently, SBP offers various subsidized
refinance facilities to the banks / DFls to channelise the funds into priority sectors.

It is worth mentioning here that Shariah compliant Islamic Export Refinance facility and Islamic long
term financing facility for the exporters are available to the Islamic banking industry. However,
addition of Shariah compliant financing facility for Renewable Energy, financing facility for storage
of agricultural produce and Refinance facility for modernization of SMEs will meet the long awaited
demand of the industry, especially for the Agriculture and SME sectors.

Mudarabah based facilities would provide long term cheaper liquidity to the end users. The
financing under Islamic financing facility for Renewable Energy will be available in two categories.
These are (i)prospective sponsors desirous of setting up renewable energy power projects with
capacity ranging between 1 — 50 MW and (ii) consumers willing to install facility using renewable
energy source for generation of electricity ranging between 4 KW — 1 MW for own use and/or for
supplying to the distribution company.

Islamic Financing facility for storage of agricultural produce will be available for setting up silos,
warehouses and cold storages. Refinance facility for modernization of SMEs will be available for
purchase of new imported/ local plant & machinery for SMEs.

Governor SBP shares with Chambers of Commerce the measures to enhance utilization of Risk
Sharing Facility under SBP’s Rozgar Scheme

In order to improve utilization of Risk Sharing Facility under SBP ROZGAR scheme, Governor SBP, Dr.
Reza Baqir, held an online meeting with the Presidents of Chambers of Commerce and Industries of the
15 regions where SBP(BSC) offices are located.

At the outset, the Governor highlighted that facilitation of business community is a priority of the
central bank particularly for its ongoing measures taken to combat the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
He briefed the participants about the SBP major refinance schemes for payment of wages and salaries
to prevent layoffs and relief package for the deferment of principal amount and restructuring of loans
and their progress. The Governor shared the data on these measures giving details on the financing
availed by both corporates and SMEs under its Rozgar Scheme and the Risk Sharing Facility provided by
the government. As of 05th June 2020, banks have approved requests amounting to Rs. 21 billion for
SMEs and small corporate to support payment of salaries and wages to their workers and employees.

Governor Bagqir remarked that though the financing availed by businesses is encouraging so far, State
Bank is also cognizant of the fact that SMEs are facing difficulties in availing this facility from the banks
for various reasons. To address such issues and to facilitate the SME borrowers, Governor Baqir
announced an elaborate arrangement of focal persons devised by SBP. He said that SBP has created
teams of focal persons of SBP-BSC Chief Managers and senior officials of all the banks in all the 15 cities
where SBP (BSC) offices are located. These teams will primarily be responsible to address issues faced
by businesses in availing the financing under SBP Rozgar scheme in all the cities of the country clubbed
in to 16 groups. They will liaise with Chambers of Commerce and other trade bodies to listen to their
suggestions as well. The details of these teams are available on the SBP website at:

www.sbp.org.pk/sbp-fp.pdf
www.sbp.org.pk/banks-fp.pdf

Businesses can extend their queries or complaints to the SBP focal persons, who will resolve issues with
the help of Bank’s focal persons.

Dr. Reza Baqir shared with the chambers that SBP is also contemplating to extend the scheme further
as it understands that the businesses are still facing challenges due to impact of COVID-19 on daily lives
of common people. He assured that SBP stands ready to take every possible measure under its
mandate that can facilitate the businesses to overcome the difficulties faced by them

SBP extends time for settlement of Foreign
Currency Loans amid COVID-19 Pandemic

Continuing with its commitment to support the industry amid COVID-19 pandemic, SBP has further
facilitated the exporters and importers by allowing extension up to 180 days in settlement of their
export and import loans under FE-25 Scheme.

they are facing delay inrealization of export proceeds due to COVID-19. Moreover, bankscan also allow
settlement of FE-25 loans to exporters through substitute contract during the extended period of 180
days where the original export contract has been cancelled due to COVID-19. Likewise, SBP has also
allowed the bank to extend the maturity of FE-25 import loans by 180 days. This facilitation has been
provided to exporter and importers for their foreign currency loans maturing up to September 30,
2020. For details http://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2020/FECL17.htm

SBP enhances loan limits and expands relief measures for microfinance

 

borrowers

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the limits for housing finance and microenterprise loans up to
Rs3 million from the existing limit of Rs1 million for borrowings from the microfinance banks. Likewise, the
maximum size of general loans has been enhanced from Rs150,000 to Rs350,000. Further, to
commensurate with enhanced loan sizes, annual income eligibility for general loans and housing loans has
been increased up to Rs1.2 million and Rs1.5 million, respectively. Moreover, the limit for lending against

gold collateral to meet borrowers’ immediate domestic or emergency needs has also been enhanced.

The decision to increase the limit of housing finance loans has been made in view of the fact that the existing
loan limit was insufficient to promote low cost housing finance through MFBs. Similarly, limits for lending
to micro enterprises needed to be enhanced considering the large unmet demand from Micro & Small
Enterprise (MSEs). These initiatives would further support the micro borrowers and enterprises and an early
revival of economic activities in the current challenging times. However, in order to ensure sustainability,
the enhanced loans sizes for housing and microenterprises would be allowed to those MFBs which are on

sound footing and have the capacity to successfully cater the higher loan sizes.

In addition, SBP Relief Package for microfinance banks, which included deferment of principal and
restructuring of microfinance loans to deal with the adverse implications of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,
have now been expanded with three measures. First, the relief measures that were earlier available from
Feb 15, 2020 have now been allowed to borrowers who were regular on December 31, 2019. This would
allow more borrowers to avail the regulatory relief who were previously not eligible. Second, to facilitate
MFBs during these testing times, the provisioning requirements have been extended by 2-months; and
third, client’s consent through recorded lines has been allowed to facilitate the customers to avail the relief
package.

Relevant circulars are available at SBP’s website at http://www.sbp.org.pk/acd/2020/C2.htm

SBP provides exporters an increased limit of Rs190 billion

In order to further facilitate the exporters, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the limit of
refinancing provided to the banks under Exports Finance Scheme (EFS) by Rs100 billion. Hence, banks
will now have overall limits of Rs700 billion for the exporters for FY21. Moreover, to promote export-
oriented investment, Rs90 billion have also been allocated under Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF)
for the FY 21.This amount is in addition to limit of Rs100 billion already allocated to banks/DFls under
Temporary Economic Relief Facility (TERF) - a concessionary refinance scheme for setting up of
industrial units.

Export Finance Scheme and Long Term Financing Facility are two of the oldest schemes of SBP under
which concessionary financing is provided to the exporters. EFS is operational since 1973 to meet short
term financing needs of exporters, while LTFF has been available 2008. For both the schemes, their
Shariah compliant versions are also available.

Since the emergence of Covid-19, SBP has taken several measures to counter its impact on the economy
and safeguarding country’s exports has been a key priority. SBP has provided a number of relaxations
under EFS and LTFF since March 2020 including:

1. Additional period of six months for making shipment against loans availed under EFS Part-I.

2. Additional period of six months for meeting required export performance against loans
availed under EFS Part-ll. The export performance of this extended period will also be
considered for calculating the entitlement limit for FY21.

3. Reduction in showing export performance from 2 times to 1.5 times against financing availed
during FY20 and FY21.

4. Relaxation in the eligibility criteria for availing finance under LTFF.

5. Allowing deferment of principal amount for one year and/or rescheduling/restructuring of
loans under LTFF.

It is expected that with the above already provided relaxations, which were widely appreciated by
business community; above enhancement of around Rs190 billion in limits will cater to exporters’
cheaper liquidity requirement. SBP is closely monitoring the situation and is ready to take any further
actions required to support the export sector.

SBP extends the availability of Deferment of Principal
Amount of Loans facility till September 2020

Considering the fact that COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to stress the cash flow of small and
medium sized businesses and households, SBP has decided to extend the Deferment of
Principal Amount facility up till 30° September 2020. This facility will however be available for
Small & Medium Enterprise Financing, Consumer Financing, Housing Finance, Agriculture
Finance and Micro financing only. The facility is not being extended to corporates and
commercial borrowers since a significant amount of their loans and advances has already been
deferred. It is expected that more businesses and households, who were not able to avail the
facility, will benefit from this extension.

On March 26"" 2020, amid growing concerns about the potential economic impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) with the collaboration of Pakistan Banks Association (PBA)
announced a comprehensive set of measures to help businesses and households to manage their
finances. Among these, a key measure was the deferment of principal amount of loans and advances
by banks and DFls. Under this facility, businesses and households could request for the deferment of
their loans and advances for a period of one year, albeit continuing to service the mark-up amount. The
measure also ensured that the deferment of principal will not affect borrower’s credit history and such
facilities will not be reported as restructured/rescheduled in the credit bureau’s data. This measure
proved extremely helpful for borrowers and is evident from the fact that up till 3 July 2020, banks
deferred Rs. 593 billion of principal amount of loans of over 359 thousand borrowers. A very large
number of borrowers— 95 percent of total beneficiaries of this scheme, as of July 3, 2020 have been
small borrowers including SMEs, consumer finance, and microfinance.

Governor SBP apprises President Arif Alvi on measures for Differently Abled persons

His Excellency President Islamic Republic of Pakistan Dr. Arif Alvi visited State Bank of Pakistan today
for a Roundtable Discussion on Financial Inclusion of Differently Abled Persons hosted by Governor
State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir. Senior officials of SBP, Presidents and CEOs of Banks and
representatives of Network of Organizations Working for People with Disabilities, Pakistan (NOWPDP)
also participated in this roundtable discussion.

Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir welcomed the President and gave a detailed presentation on the two
types of interventions by SBP for the differently abled persons. These include initiatives taken by SBP
to facilitate the differently abled persons for accessing banking premises and services and, providing
access to finance through various SBP refinance schemes. He informed the President about the
regulatory instructions for the banks by SBP and its own initiatives to address the problems faced by
different categories of differently abled persons and their progress since 2018.

For people faced with challenges related to upper and lower limb, Governor shared with the President

queue assistance; construction of ramps at the entrance of existing branches and ATM cabins to allow
easy access to special persons and wheelchair users; relaxation in the requirement of biometric
verification for account opening; and facilitation desks for special persons at SBP main building and its
offices countrywide. Regarding steps taken by SBP to facilitate persons with visual impairment,
Governor SBP informed the President about the special features of currency notes such as size, lines &
dots; installation of Talking ATMs; provision of ATM/Debit and internet banking facilities; and
countrywide awareness sessions on features of currency notes.

With respect to the second type of SBP interventions, Dr. Baqir apprised the President about two credit
schemes supported by SBP for the financial inclusion of differently abled persons. The first is the Small
Enterprise Financing and Credit Guarantee Scheme, which is available to differently abled persons
holding CNIC with a special logo/symbol for setting up new business enterprises or for expansion of
existing ones at a subsidized financing rate of 5% per annum for the tenor of 5 years including grace
period of up to 6 months. The second SBP scheme is Financing Facility of Low Cost Housing for Special

SBP extends its relief package to borrowers availing loans under Refinance Schemes

State Bank of Pakistan has continuously been reviewing the challenges arising out of COVID-19
pandemic situation with particular reference to the financial sector and taking measures. Expanding
the scope of its recently announced relief package for households and businesses, SBP has taken
another major step today. State Bank has allowed similar relaxations, as provided under the relief
package, on its concessional refinance schemes. Under various refinance schemes loans are provided
with preferential terms and conditions to promote growth in priority sectors of the economy. Now the
relaxation allowed for deferment in repayment of principal amount for one year for corporate,
consumer, agriculture, SMEs and microfinance sectors, will now be available on financing of banks/
DFls under SBP’s refinance schemes as well. With this deferment of principal, the complete repayment
schedule/tenor of the loan will be extended by one year. The borrowers will, however, continue
servicing their mark up during the period of principal deferment. In case borrowers are not able to
service mark-up payment, banks/DFls may reschedule/restructure the loan in such a manner that tenor
of the loan can go up to one year beyond the existing maximum tenor of the respective scheme.
Borrowers of SBP’s following refinance schemes and their Shariah alternatives would benefit from this

relaxation:

e Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF)

e Financing Facility for Storage of Agricultural Produce (FFSAP)

e Refinance Facility for Modernization of SMEs

e Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs

e Refinance Scheme for Working Capital Financing of Small Enterprises and Low-End Medium
Enterprises

SBP enhances scope of refinance facility to support health facilities

On 17° March, 2020, SBP introduced a refinance scheme, titled Refinance Facility to Combat
Covid-19 (RFCC), to support the hospitals and health sector for providing services to directly
fight against Covid-19. Under this scheme, banks provide concessional loans at a maximum
end-user rate of 3 percent for 5 years for hospitals and medical centers to purchase medical
equipment and set up isolation wards for developing capacity and supporting the health sector
in fight against COVID-19. Since its inception up till 2"" July 2020, Rs 6.4 billion of concessional
credit have been approved for hospitals and other eligible facilities to fight COVID-19.

Keeping in view the encouraging response and the potential to help developing the health
facilities in the country, SBP has now expanded the scope of this refinance facility further.
The scheme now allows manufacturers of protective gears and equipment, including items
such as masks, dresses, testing kits, hospital beds, ventilators etc. to avail financing under
RFCC. Moreover, to cope with the rising needs of the health facilities in general in the
country, SBP has allowed hospitals serving patients even other than COVID-19 to avail this
facility. Refinance facility will be available for setting up or expansion of the existing hospitals
fulfilling minimum specified standards. For setting up new hospitals under this scheme,
payments will be released by the banks on completing relevant milestones. Details are
provided in the circular at: http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL16.htm

RFCC is highly subsidized facility where SBP provides refinance to banks at 0% whereas banks
can keep a maximum margin of 3%. Some of the banks treating this as part of their CSR are
keeping margins very low.

Banking Sector’s performance and resilience remained satisfactory during H1CY20, says the
Mid-Year Performance Review of the Banking Sector

SBP has today issued the Mid-Year Performance Review (MPR) of the Banking Sector for the
year 2020. The review comprehensively covers the performance and soundness of the
banking sector for the period January to June 2020 (H1CY20).

The review suggests that—despite elevated economic stress driven by the COVID-19
pandemic—the assets of the banking sector witnessed a decent expansion of 7.8 percent
during H1CY20. Robust increase in investments, funded by surge in deposits, explains this
growth. Advances, on the contrary, observed mild downtick owing to the economic slackness
caused by the disruption in the business activities after the outbreak. Sans SBP supportive
measures, though, the contraction in advances could have been much higher.

The review also highlighted that the policy measures rolled out by SBP facilitated the banking
sector in conserving the capital, enhancing the lending capacity and increasing the loss
absorption ability. As a result, despite some increase in credit risk, banking sector
demonstrated improved profitability and enhanced resilience. The Non-performing loans
(NPLs) ratio increased from 8.6 percent as of end December 2019 to 9.7 percent as of end
June 2020. However, net NPLs to loans ratio, which is a better measure of credit risk,
increased only marginally from 1.7% to 1.9%. The earnings marked visible improvement as
profitability jumped by 52% on YoY basis. This improvement resulted from higher interest
income, deceleration in interest expenses and rise in non-interest income. With better
profitability, the soundness of the banking sector further strengthened as Capital Adequacy
Ratio (CAR) increased to 18.7 percent in June-20 from 17.0 percent in December-19.

The review also includes the results of the 6"" wave of SBP’s Systemic Risk Survey (SRS)
conducted in July-August, 2020, which represents the views of the market participants. The
survey results indicate that—at present and for the next six months—the respondents
consider global risks and domestic macroeconomic risks to be important. Notably, the policy
measures taken by SBP to mitigate the implications of COVID-19 have been very well
received by the stakeholders.

Revision of Guidelines on Stress Testing of the Banking Sector

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has today released a revised suite of Guidelines on Stress Testing, which
replaces the earlier guidelines issued in 2012. Stress testing is a key tool used globally by banks for risk
management and capital planning. Accordingly, the revised guidelines will further strengthen the risk
management capacity of the banks, Development Finance Institutions (DFls) and Micro-Finance Banks
(MEBs), in line with evolving international best practices and changing local economic and financial
dynamics.

The scope of revised guidelines has been broadened to incorporate guidance on Macro-stress Testing
(MST), besides the Sensitivity Analysis (SA) with an enhanced number of shock scenarios. In terms of
coverage, besides banks/DFls, the Islamic Banks/Islamic Banking Branches (IBs/IBBs) and MFBs will also
perform SA exercise. Further, the Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) will be required to
conduct MST annually, which will facilitate in improving the supervision and monitoring of these large
sized banks. Moreover, the data submission requirements have been rationalized and financial institutions
will now be required to furnish data on a minimal number of variables.

The guidelines also envisage supervisory engagement with banks based on SBP’s in-house assessment to
ensure that appropriate risk mitigation measures are taken for strengthening the resilience of the
individual institutions and the banking system. The guidelines can be accessed at the following link:

members of the chamber in which he talked at length about initiatives & efforts of SBP to promote
economicgrowth inthe country and provide liquidity and other support during COVID. The Governor
was accompanied by Deputy Governor Sima Kamil and other senior officials of SBP.

Governor’s address traversed many themes. From the outset he thanked the President LCCI Mr. Tariq
Misbah for inviting him to visit LCCI. He then went on to talk about the COVID — 19 challenges and the
need for rapid response especially to protect the vulnerable segments of the society. He said that SBP
tooka number of steps to mitigate the impact of COVID — 19 on economicgrowth. Since the onset of
pandemic-related economic pressure, SBP reduced policy rate from 13.25 percent to 7 percent, he
said. Dr. Bagir added that SBP allowed one-year extension in principal payment along with
rescheduling/restructuring of loans without affecting the credit history of the borrowers. He also
noted that SBP had placed the information about its measures on its website.

Continuing his address, the Governor SBP elaborated several other measures taken by the Central
Bank to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. These included Rozgar Scheme launched to prevent lay-
offs, Temporary Refinance Facility (TERF) for setting up of new & modernizing/expanding of existing
businesses, Refinance Facility for Combating COVID —19 (RFCC) to boost the capacity of hospitals and
medical centers, relaxations for exporters under Export Finance Schemes (EFS) & Long Term Financing
Facility (LTFF) are among the major initiatives taken by SBP to provide necessary stimulus to
businesses, he contended.

Dr. Baqir stressed the importance of provision of business-friendly environment. With regardto Ease
of Doing Business (EODB), said Dr. Baqir, SBP has taken a number of proactive measure like
encouraging banks to facilitate borrowers by offering products as per theirneedsand demands. He
was confident that the stable banking system of Pakistan is fully equipped to explore the untapped
potential of local market.

Talking about the use of technology in bringing the cost of doing business down, the Governor said
that round the-clock-facility has been provided to importers/exporters to pay customs duties, taxes
and other dues electronically through internet banking and ATMs for clearance of consignments
through WeBOC system, besides conventional methods of cheque and cash. Dr. Baqir informed the
meeting/session about the Roshan Digital Account (RDA), which is an initiative of SBP for non-
resident Pakistanis to integrate them with Pakistan’s financial system.

The Governor proceeded to talk about the Housing and Construction Sector which he said is the
priority sector forthe Government of Pakistan due toits impact on economicdevelopment and job
creation. Deputy Governor Sima Kamil shared that in line with its vision of providing affordable
housing to the masses, Government of Pakistan will be providing a markup subsidy facility for the
construction and purchase of new houses. This facility will allow all individuals, who will be
constructing or buying a new house for the first time, to avail bank’s financing at subsidized and
affordable markup rates. She said that SBP has undertaken various initiatives including issuance of
separate Prudential Regulations for housing finance, capacity building of stakeholders and facilitation
in establishment of Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC). Among other measures, SBP has

SBP enhances scope of its Renewable Energy Refinance Scheme to encourage
production of clean energy

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced the scope of its Refinance Scheme for Renewable Energy by
allowing financing under category III of the scheme to solar and wind based energy sale companies. In
light of the feedback received from stakeholders, the size of the project established by vendor/
supplier/ energy sale company has been enhanced from 1 MW to 5 MW. Accordingly, the cumulative
financing limit has also been increased from Rs.1 billion to Rs.2 billion. Details are provided in the
circular at:

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL23.htm

SBP Financing Scheme for Renewable Energy was announced in June 2016 with an aim to help
addressing the challenges of energy shortages and climate change in the country. The scheme
comprised of two categories: Category 1 allowed financing for setting up of renewable energy
power projects with capacity ranging from 1 MW to 50 MW for own use or selling of electricity
to the national grid or combination of both. Category II allowed financing to domestic,
agriculture, commercial and industrial borrowers for installation of renewable energy based
projects/ solutions of up-to 1 MW to generate electricity for own use or selling to the
grid/distribution company under net metering. Later, in July 2019, SBP introduced a new
Category III for facilitating financing to vendors/suppliers for installation of wind and solar
systems/solutions of up to 1 MW. SBP also launched a Shariah complaint version of the scheme
in August 2019.

Since the introduction of the scheme, total outstanding financing under the Scheme has
reached to Rs.15.6 billion for 217 projects having potential of adding 292 MW of energy supply.
This revision in the scheme is expected to not only attract fresh local and foreign investment
in the sector but also facilitate production of clean energy in the country, helping in managing
climate change.

Trend of Strong Workers' Remittances Continues in September

e Workers’ remittances remained above $2 billion for the fourth consecutive month in
September. They increased to $2.3 billion, 31.2 percent higher than the same month last year
and 9 percent higher than in August.

e Onacumulative basis, remittances rose to a record $ 7.1 billion in Q1-FY21, 31.1 higher than the
same period last year.

e The level of remittances in September was slightly higher than SBP’s projections of $ 2
billion. Efforts under the Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) and the gradual re-opening of
major host destinations such as Middle East, Europe and United States contributed to the
sustained increase in workers’ remittances.

SBP releases Second Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its Second Quarterly Report for FY20 on the State of
Pakistan’s Economy. According to the report, the stabilization efforts and regulatory measures yielded
notable improvements during the first half of FY20. The current account deficit contracted to a six-year
low, foreign exchange reserves increased, the primary budget recorded a surplus, and core inflation
eased. Importantly, export-based manufacturing showed signs of traction and construction activities
picked up, indicating that the economy was on the path of recovery. Progress under the IMF program
remained on track and the credit rating agencies maintained their stable outlook for Pakistan during
the review period. Further improvements will require deep structural reforms to put the economy on
a firm path towards sustainable growth.

In case of balance of payments, the report noted that the improvement in current account mostly
stemmed from a reduction in the import bill with some contribution from export earnings. Depressed
international commodity prices had partially offset the gains in export volumes offered by a
competitive exchange rate. With the exception of the telecommunications sector, foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows were also about the same level as last year. The report emphasized that
reforms needed to be prioritized to attract and sustain higher FDI inflows into the country.

Regarding the fiscal sector, the report noted that the primary budget recorded a surplus, while the
fiscal deficit was contained during H1-FY20 compared to the same period last year. This was due to a
significant growth in revenues despite a slowdown in the economy and the compression in imports.
The reversal of earlier tax concessions and implementation of new levies helped increase the revenue
collection. Nonetheless, the overall revenue target was missed, highlighting the scope for greater
efforts to broaden the tax base and increase documentation in the economy.

The report further highlighted the challenges pertaining to the agriculture sector. The sector appears
less resilient to challenges like constrained water availability and climate change. The cotton crop, in
particular, was hit by unfavorable weather, pest attacks and low water availability. Though the
prospects for the wheat crop and livestock are encouraging, the decline in cotton production is likely
to undermine the agriculture sector’s performance in FY20.

On the inflation front, the report noted that the inflationary pressures continued to build up throughout
the first half of FY20. While the non-food-non-energy (NFNE) inflation exhibited stability amid subdued
demand conditions in the economy, food inflation surged steeply in both the quarters. Given that the
surge in inflationary pressures was mostly an outcome of supply disruptions, which are typically
seasonal and temporary and core inflation did not rise by a commensurate amount, the SBP’s
projections for the average headline inflation for FY20 remained broadly unchanged at 11-12 percent.
This was one of the major reasons the Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate
unchanged during both its September and November meetings during the first half of FY20.

To ensure that the stabilization measures lead to a sustainable growth path for the country, the report
emphasizes that the ongoing efforts must be complemented with further structural reforms. In this
regard, the Special Section of the report identifies the state of competition in the domestic economy
as an area needing attention of the policymakers. It assesses the current state of competition in the

SBP introduces incentive and penalty mechanism for banks to promote housing and
construction financing

 

Building upon its earlier measure of setting mandatory target for banks to extend mortgage loans and
financing for developers and builders, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a mechanism to
incentivize meeting these targets. The mechanism also penalizes the banks for any shortfall in meeting
the target.

According to this mechanism, commencing from December 31, 2020, banks will find an incentive of
maintaining reduced Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) with SBP, in the next quarter, in case they
achieve or exceed the target of financing for housing and construction of buildings set for the quarter.
The amount of CRR to be maintained for the forthcoming quarter will be reduced by an amount equal
to increase in housing and construction finance from 30‘June 2020 to the end of the relevant quarter.
This incentive, however, will be subject to a ceiling of 1 percent of the total demand and time liabilities
based on which CRR is calculated. Further, the banks shall continue to maintain daily minimum CRR,
which is currently at 3 percent.

Conversely, if the banks fail to meet the target, they will be penalized by requiring to maintain extra
CRR by an amount equal to the shortage from the target. It would be pertinent to mention here that
banks do not earn any return on the amount of CRR maintained. Therefore, a decrease in amount of
CRR works as an incentive for banks, whereas an increase in amount of CRR serves as a penalty for
banks. Further details of the incentive mechanism are provided in the circular issued to banks and
available at: https://www.sbp.org.pk/dmmd/2020/CL3.htm

SBP has been actively working with banks to support finance for the promotion of housing and
construction of building activities in the country. The growth of the housing and construction sector is
vital for the economy, due to its linkages with a number of allied industries and potential for jobs
creation and Pakistan has lower private sector credit to GDP than many comparable countries. In order
to enhance the flow of financing towards this sector, SBP has required banks to achieve mandatory
targets, equivalent to 5 percent of their domestic private sector credit by December 31, 2021, to
finance the housing and construction activities. Accordingly, quarterly targets from December 31, 2020
till December 31, 2021 have been agreed with the banks.

SBP expects that this incentive mechanism, through changes in the CRR structure, will result in banks
increasing their emphasis on housing and construction finance.

SBP launches consultation on Banking on Equality Policy — an initiative to increase financial
inclusion of women in the country

In order to address one of the key challenges hindering economic growth of Pakistan to its full potential,
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has launched a national dialogue on its forthcoming policy to reduce the
gender gap in financial inclusion. Dr. Reza Baqir, Governor SBP hosted a webinar titled “Launch of
Consultation on Banking on Equality policy: Reducing the Gender Gap in Financial Inclusion” on
Monday, December 21, 2020. The webinar featured an exclusive panel discussion around women’s
financial inclusion with international thought leaders in the area of gender and finance including
Princess Zahra Aga Khan, Director Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN); Ms. Ceyla Pazarbasioglu,
Director of Strategy, Policy and Review Department, IMF; and Dr. Reza Baqir Governor, SBP. Dr. Anita
Zaidi, President of Gender Equality at Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation moderated the discussion.
Deputy Governor SBP, Ms Sima Kamil made a presentation on the state of women’s financial inclusion
in the economy and shared the features of the Banking on Equality policy. The webinar was attended
by diverse local and international stakeholders representing public offices, international agencies,
banks and associations. In addition, nearly 1,000 people also watched the webinar live through social
media platforms.

Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, in his opening remarks said that improved gender parity in financial and
economic opportunities can enhance overall socio-economic development outcomes of a nation, for
not just the present but future generations. He noted that the event had three key goals. The first
objective was to bring attention to the shared goal of reducing the gender gap in women’s financial
inclusion. The second goal was to share the content of the Banking on Equality policy that was being
launched for consultation. Finally, the third goal was to get feedback from stakeholders on the policy
itself. He welcomed the feedback that was provided by the international participants and others that
would be provided over the course of next several weeks. He noted that central banks in developing
and emerging markets, where there are often market failures, have an important role to play in
ensuring that important sections of the society don’t get left out from benefitting from the financial
system through access to saving, borrowing, insurance and other financial products. He said that the
SBP looked forward to working with other domestic and international partners to further the cause of
improving women’s financial inclusion. In this context he also appreciated the support being provided
by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for helping advance SBP’s agenda on promoting financial
inclusion in Pakistan.

In her presentation Deputy Governor SBP, Ms. Sima Kamil, noted that the gender gap in financial
inclusion is rising. She noted that only 11.7 million, or 18% of the adult women, have active bank
accounts compared to 51% for men. Deputy Governor Kamil unveiled five key pillars of the Banking on
Equality policy under which actions are targeted towards improving institutional diversity, product
diversification and development capability, customer acquisition and facilitation approaches towards
women segments, gender disaggregated data collection, and prioritizing gender focus in SBP’s policies.
The policy recommendations will be applicable on all banks, microfinance banks, DFls and EMls.

Governor SBP inaugurates Polyculture Forest and Museum Laboratory

Governor SBP Dr. Reza Baqir inaugurated the Polyculture Forest at Pakistan Security Printing
Corporation (PSPC) Karachi. He was briefed about the project in detail by the management. The
Polyculture Forest is inspired by the incumbent government’s priority of encouraging people,
communities, organizations, businesses and civil society to collectively plant trees and thus play their
part in improving climatic conditions.

The PSPC Polyculture Forest project envisages a 5,000 square meters of “urban forest”, where about
15,000 saplings of 45 indigenous species will be planted using the “Miyawaki” Method that involves
planting dozens of native species in the same area. The Miyawaki approach ensures rapid growth of
plants; reportedly, plant growth is 10 times faster and the resulting plantation is 30 times denser than
usual; moreover, the forest becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. A mini lake for the
project has also been developed to complement the Forest ecosystem and support aquatic life - plants,
fish and other creatures. The project also involves micro-sprinkler irrigation system, which supplies only
the required amount of water directly to the roots of trees. When fully mature, PSPC Polyculture Forest
would be absorbing 300-350 tons of CO2 per year. The forest’s additional benefits include providing a
natural habitat and food for various species of birds, mammals, and insects; a lowered temperature of
the surrounding areas due to natural air-conditioning impact of the trees; recharge of ground water
table; prevention of soil erosion, etc.

In his brief address on the occasion, the Governor stated that as part of State Bank and PSPC’s
contribution towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals and care for the Environment, the
PSPC Polyculture Forest, a green island in the urban concrete jungle of Karachi, is a gift for the entire
community. Furthermore, he appreciated the efforts of the entire PSPC team, especially to the
numerous members, who worked day and night, even during the pandemic and made this innovative
project a reality.

Later, the Governor inaugurated SBP Paper Conservation Laboratory. After the inauguration, he
conducted the tour of the facility and appreciated the work done by the staff.

Established under the Division of Archives & Record Management, Paper conservation lab is unique in
the country, since objects at the Archives/ record management/ Museum of SBP are exceptional in
terms of history, emotional import, and technology; as such, the work aimed at their conservation is
extremely important. The laboratory will be the repository of the permanently valuable records of SBP,
which have been determined to have continuing historical value and/or require preservation for legal
or fiscal reasons. The other aspect of the preservation is digitization of all the records in collaboration
with ITD, SBP, through Knowledge Management system.

For in-depth analysis and conservation of precious records places the SBP at the vanguard of country’s
efforts to safeguard its important heritage and history. The conservation facilities at the laboratory
include paper conservation, which is highly technical job, preserves the paper for another 100 to 200
years, fumigation chamber, binding and unbinding facility, Dust vacuum of files with high tech dust
chamber and vacuum/freeze drying chamber.

SBP releases Annual Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for the fiscal
year 2019-20 today.

According to the report, following difficult but necessary stabilization efforts during the first nine
months of the fiscal year, Pakistan’s economy was well on course for a steady recovery on the eve of
the Covid-19 pandemic. By February 2020, the unprecedented balance of payments crisis created by
the unsustainable macroeconomic policies of previous years had been forcefully addressed through
sizable reductions in the twin fiscal and current account deficits. Following a round of monetary
tightening during FY19, core inflation remained relatively stable, notwithstanding an uptick in headline
inflation due to one-off and seasonal factors. In turn, this hard-won stabilization was beginning to lead
to the revival of economic activity and the restoration of business and consumer confidence.

However, this momentum was temporarily disrupted around the last quarter of the fiscal year by the
global and domestic spread of Covid-19 and the lockdown measures that it necessitated. While these
measures were remarkably successful in containing the outbreak in Pakistan, they simultaneously
strained manufacturing, retail, transport and trade-related activities. As a result, Pakistan’s real GDP is
estimated to have contracted by 0.4 percent in FY20 — the country’s first brush with negative economic
growth since FY52.

The report highlights that it was only due to the earlier gains on the macroeconomic stability front that
policymakers in Pakistan were able to extend aggressive support to businesses and households in
response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Without this support, the private sector would have found it even
more challenging to cope with the fallout from the mobility restrictions and supply-chain disruptions
created by the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression. In an unprecedented move,
the government was able to expand the volume and outreach of its social uplift programs, enabling
over 14.8 million households to receive emergency cash transfers for meeting essential needs to date.
For the first-time ever, the SBP arranged multiple emergency meetings of the Monetary Policy
Committee to react to the fast-evolving situation, and cut the policy rate by 625 bps over a roughly 3-
month time period, the second-largest cut among emerging markets in the wake of Covid-19. In
addition, the SBP also rolled out targeted and time-bound liquidity support for firms and households,
including the deferment of principal repayments; loan restructuring; refinancing for firms to pay
salaries to their employees in exchange for job protection; relaxations in performance criteria for
export-related refinance schemes; and concessionary refinance facilities for long-term investment
projects and for hospitals on the front-lines of the battle against the pandemic. Together, these
measures — mainly aimed at preventing liquidity problems from turning into solvency problems —
represented the largest liquidity backstops ever deployed by the SBP, and their estimated impact on
the cash flow of households and businesses was equivalent to 4.1 percent of GDP as of end-October
2020.

Importantly, policymakers were able to provide this strong and timely macroeconomic stimulus
without undermining external stability or the confidence of domestic and international investors. In
particular, despite heightened global risk aversion and unprecedented capital outflows from emerging
markets, movements in Pakistan’s asset prices, including the exchange rate and the stock market, and
sovereign risk perception remained in line with those across comparable economies. This reflected the
fact that the stimulus was provided without compromising the improvements in underlying

Relaxation in Foreign Exchange Regulations to Facilitate Imports Against Advance Payment
and Open Account Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

 

SBP has allowed all federal and provincial government departments, hospitals in public and
private sectors, charitable organizations, manufacturers and commercial importers to make Import
Advance Payment and Import on Open Account, without any limit, for the import of medical
equipments, medicines and other ancillary items for the treatment of COVID-19. Further, the banks
have been allowed to approve Electronic Import Form (EIF) for import of the equipments, donated by
international donor agencies and foreign governments to facilitate their seamless and speedy

imports.

Number of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan are increasing. An effective strategy to fight against
the menace of COVID-19 requires timely availability of needed equipments. In the backdrop of
unprecedented spread of the deadly virus, SBP has taken these measures to facilitate the import of
much needed equipment in a seamless manner. SBP has also accordingly revised its existing foreign

exchange regulations for import of goods against Advance Payment and Open Account.

State Bank as a responsible state institution would continue to provide its needed support in

nation’s drive to fight against the menace of COVID-19.

SBP releases First Quarterly Report on the State of Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan today released its First Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy for
FY20. According to the report, Pakistan’s economy moved progressively along the adjustment path during the
first quarter of FY20. The macroeconomic stabilization process picked up momentum with the initiation of the
IMF’s Extended Fund Facility program: the SBP continued to keep the monetary policy consistent with the
medium-term inflation target; whereas, consolidation efforts were visible on the fiscal front. Furthermore, a
market-based exchange rate system was implemented, to which the interbank foreign exchange market
adjusted relatively well. Notably, the government avoided deficit monetization, including rollover of SBP debt
and actively pursued documentation efforts.

According to the report, the payoff from ongoing stabilization efforts has become visible in the form of
declining twin deficits. The current account deficit in Q1-FY20 fell to less than half of last year’s level,
primarily on the back of significant import compression. Owing to low unit prices, exports growth remained
low. However, in volumetric terms exports witnessed noticeable growth. On the fiscal front, the overall deficit
remained lower as compared to the same period last year, and the primary balance recorded a surplus for the
first time in 7 quarters. This improvement was made possible through both revenue enhancing and
expenditure control measures. Importantly, development expenditures witnessed a sharp growth of 30.5
percent during the quarter.

In case of GDP, the report noted that the revised estimates for the kharif season suggest that the production
of important crops is likely to fall short of target for FY20. The large-scale manufacturing sector witnessed a
decline of 5.9 percent in Q1-FY20 on YoY basis. This contraction was broad-based, as construction-allied
industries, petroleum and automobile industries continued on downward path. In contrast, previous
corrections in the exchange rate helped the export-oriented industries, as reflected in the relatively better
performance of textiles and leather. On balance, however, achieving the real GDP growth target of 4 percent
appears unlikely.

The report further highlighted that the average headline CPI inflation reached 11.5 percent in Q1-FY20,
extending the steep upward trend persistent since the beginning of FY19. Not only this level was double the
inflation observed in the same quarter last year, it was also the highest level of quarterly inflation since Q4-
FY12. This outcome was attributed to the lagged pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation towards the
end of FY19; rationalization of energy tariffs; and revenue-led fiscal measures taken in the budget 2019-20,
which included the imposition of federal excise duty on a number of consumer items, and the ending of the
zero-rating regime for export-oriented sectors and of the reduced GST regime on sugar.

On the external front, the balance of payments continued to improve during Q1-FY20. Beside significant
improvement in trade deficit, and with the receipt of the first EFF tranche from the IMF and increase in foreign
portfolio investment, the current account gap was plugged by the available financial flows. These inflows also
helped the SBP to increase its foreign exchange reserves by USS 656.2 million and reduce its net forward
liabilities by USS 1.3 billion during the quarter.

Going forward, the report emphasizes, it is vital that the government continues to address the underlying
structural vulnerabilities and put the economy on a balanced and sustainable growth trajectory. Furthermore,
there is a need to build on gains on the ease of doing business front. Side by side, it is equally important for
firms to leverage on the facilitative policies, particularly the export-promotion incentives, and gain a foothold
in the global value chains (GVCs). As mentioned in a separate special section in the report, increased
participation in the GVCs would not only align the country’s product mix with trends in global demand, but

also put the exports on a sustainable growth path.

Workers’ Remittances rise to record monthly high in July 2020

 

In July, workers' remittances rose to US $ 2,768.1 million. This is the highest ever level of
remittances in a single month in Pakistan.

In terms of growth, remittances increased by 36.5 percent over July 2019 (y/y) and 12.2 percent
over June 2020 (m/m). Given the impact of Covid-19 globally, this increase in worker’s remittances
is encouraging.

In July, sizeable amounts of workers' remittances were received from Saudi Arabia (US $ 821.6
million), UAE (US $ 538.2 million), UK (US $ 393.9 million) and USA (US $ 250.6 million).

The growth rate in remittances compared to the same month in the previous year is around twice
as high as the Eid-ul-Adha related seasonality typically experienced over the last decade.

Several factors have likely supported the growth in remittances to date, including orderly
exchange rate conditions and policy steps taken by the State Bank and the Federal Government
under the Pakistan Remittance Initiative. These steps include reducing the threshold for eligible
transactions from USD 200 to USD 100 under the Reimbursement of Telegraphic Transfer (TT)
Charges Scheme, an increased push towards adoption of digital channels, and targeted marketing
campaigns to promote formal channels for sending remittances.

To improve data quality and better capture the source country of the remitter, the compilation
methodology for ‘country wise’ workers’ remittances has been strengthened from this month.
Therefore, country-by-country trends will be available on a consistent basis from August 2020
onwards. Importantly, the new data collection method does not affect the reporting of the level
of remittances arriving into Pakistan. Further information on the improvement in the data
reporting is available at the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/Homeremit.pdf

 

http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/Homeremit.xls

 

Importantly, the revised country shares under the improved data do not necessarily imply that
remittances from one country have increased over another. Instead they demonstrate that the
source country of remittances is being recorded more accurately now.

Joint Press Release of SBP and Pakistan Embassy, USA

 

Governor SBP shares initiatives of SBP to connect Non-Resident Pakistanis financially with their
homeland in a Webinar organized by Pakistan Embassy in USA

 

 

The Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, said that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is fully
committed to facilitating overseas Pakistanis to remain financially connected with their homeland. He was
speaking to Overseas Pakistanis in a webinar organized by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington D.C.

Welcoming the Governor, the Ambassador of Pakistan to the U.S., Dr. Asad M. Khan, highlighted that
the Government attaches highest importance to serving the Pakistani American diaspora, who play a
crucial role in Pakistan’s national development. In this regard, he mentioned that the Government had
taken a number of steps to facilitate Pakistanis living abroad. He noted the significant role played by
Pakistani American community, which is the third largest contributor of remittances to Pakistan. The
Ambassador further added that the Embassy and its Consulates General across U.S. remain in close
contact with the Pakistani American community to regularly brief them on developments back home
and to explore avenues for cooperation. In this context, the Ambassador mentioned that today’s
webinar offered a unique opportunity for the Pakistani diaspora to directly interact with Governor State
Bank and his team and to share their views and feedback. He thanked Governor for taking this initiative
and sparing time to engage with the diaspora and educate them about the Government’s efforts to
make banking transactions easier for its citizens and community living abroad.

While briefing the audience about the state of the economy, the Governor remarked that the decisive
measures taken by the State Bank and the government before the COVID-19 pandemic had helped address
the balance of payments crisis that the new government had inherited. In turn, these bold steps had placed
the economy ona stronger footing, helping to provide room for policy action to combat the pandemic. He
discussed the various measures taken by SBP and the Government during the pandemic to safeguard
common people and businesses. He expressed confidence about the recent resumption of economic
activity as COVID-19 cases have receded significantly thanks to steadfast actions by the government and
lockdowns have been eased in the country. Looking ahead, he was confident that the economy would
resume along the path of stability and recovery on which it had made strong progress before the
pandemic.

Elaborating the efforts of SBP for facilitating overseas Pakistanis, Dr. Baqir said that SBP is focusing on
facilitating them by providing a secure and efficient financial system through digital means. He outlined
SBP’s commitment to a digital financial ecosystem, that would feature efficient and secure payment and
banking systems in the country. Elaborating further, he said that SBP and the Government are actively
working for further facilitation of overseas Pakistanis by increasing their access to financial markets of
Pakistan. In particular, SBP is working for facilitation of home remittances, increasing investment in
Pakistani capital markets, industry, real estate and fulfilling the life style needs of non-resident
Pakistanis. In this context, he was excited about the recent launching of the Roshan Digital Account by the
PM.

The Deputy Governor (Policy) of the State Bank, Dr. Murtaza Syed, gave a detailed presentation on the
Roshan Digital Accounts to the participants. He informed that for the first time in Pakistan’s banking
history, Non-resident Pakistanis (NRPs) have been provided an opportunity to remotely open bank
accounts in Pakistan entirely through digital means without visiting a bank in Pakistan or an Embassy or a
Consulate office. The facility has been initially launched through 8 Pakistani banks. SBP would continue to
add other banks in the list in future.

The Deputy Governor highlighted that Roshan Digital Accounts can be opened in Pak rupee and a number
of foreign currencies, which offer complete life style banking solution to account holders through digital

President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi lauds SBP and banks for progress in financial inclusion of
persons with disabilities

 

His Excellency President Islamic Republic of Pakistan Dr. Arif Alvi had an online meeting with Governor
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir, SAPM on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety, Dr Sania
Nishtar, senior SBP officials and Presidents/CEOs of banks today. The meeting took stock of the
progress on decisions made for improving the accessibility infrastructure for persons with disabilities.

In response to President, Dr. Alvi’s call, Governor SBP, Dr. Bagir, assured that SBP would continue
providing its full regulatory support to increase financial inclusion of persons with disabilities. The
banks’ Presidents/CEOs also pledged their complete cooperation for this objective.

In his welcome remarks, the Governor SBP appreciated the exceptional interest and resolve of the
President of Pakistan as a source of inspiration for all the stakeholders. He said that if the society does
not provide appropriate support to persons with disabilities, it leads to their economic
disempowerment depriving them of their independent economic and social lives. He remarked that
persons with disabilities could economically support themselves and contribute towards the society
when provided with adequate education, rehabilitation and financial and moral support. He
emphasized that a sizeable number of persons with disabilities do have the required capacity to work
and contribute in the mainstream economic activities and thus successfully support their families. He
urged the banks to be cognizant of this gap and explore avenues to make inclusion of this untapped
segment of the economy a reality.

SBP presented an update on different action items decided in the last meeting of SBP with the
President. The action items included accessible infrastructure at entrance of all bank branches and
ATM cabins, availability of forms and documents in braille for basic banking services, accessibility audit
of bank branches by SBP and allocation of credit targets for SBP refinance schemes on SME and Low
Cost Housing Finance.

The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, while speaking on the occasion said that the unavailability of
concrete information on the number of people with disabilities is a major limitation for designing
comprehensive plans to improve their quality of life. He shared that Government is working with
different stakeholders to have a better estimate of the number of people with disabilities that will help
their identification and certification.

The President of Pakistan appreciated SBP’s efforts and performance of banks in improving the
accessibility infrastructure at banks for persons with disabilities and lauded their efforts for increasing
financial inclusion of persons with disabilities. In particular, the President appreciated the
establishment of a Working Group by SBP for taking up the agenda. He, however, desired that timelines
along with a clear vision must be clearly defined for the Working Group. He further emphasized that
such working groups may also be created at each bank. He stated that creating awareness regarding
various facilities for persons with disabilities is highly imperative and social media can play an important
role in this regard.

The President further said that plight of persons with disabilities has become even more critical in the
middle of the prevalent COVID 19 crisis that is deepening pre-existing inequalities. He appreciated SBP’s
specific role in taking a number of measures to address the likely negative economic impacts on
individuals, businesses and banking institutions. The State Bank’s successful measures have reduced

SBP Allows Local Businesses to Make Instant Payments for Acquiring Services from Globally
Recognized Digital Service Providers

 

In an effort to further enhance ease of doing business in Pakistan, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has
introduced a new mechanism to enable the companies in Pakistan to make instant payments for
acquiring digital services from globally recognized digital service provider companies, without any
hassle. Now local companies can access various services including advertising, hosting, database access,
accounting management, skill development and customer support etc., from these global companies
instantaneously without any regulatory approval process. This facilitation will increase their outreach to
wider customer base locally and abroad, which would help them increase their footprint, productivity
and achieve greater efficiency.

In November 2019, State Bank introduced a framework for acquisition of services from abroad allowing
companies to acquire services after registration of its contract with SBP. However, some businesses
reported facing difficulty under this mechanism for making payments to Digital Service provider
companies. After an extensive consultative process with all the relevant stakeholders, a much simplified
process on ‘payment vs receipt basis’ has been introduced with annual limits, in addition to the existing
framework mentioned above.

Now, banks have general permission to release foreign exchange up to a maximum of USD 200,000 per
year for each local company on account of digital services, primarily in favor of 62 digital service
provider companies (including their affiliates or associated entities), listed in the Circular on SBP’s
website mentioned below. However, within this limit, authorized dealers can release foreign exchange
up to a maximum of USD 25,000 per annum to digital service providers not included in the list.

The banks may offer the digital channels to their clients, for making these payments. The circular issued
to banks announcing these measures can be _ accessed at the following link:

Governor SBP launches Digitization of FX Regulatory Approvals

Dr. Reza Baqir launched the SBP FX Regulatory Approval System (RAS) for end-to-end digitalization of
Foreign Exchange (FX) related case submission process today in a ceremony held in Karachi. At the
invitation of Governor Bagir, Dr. Ishrat Husain, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Institutional Reforms and
Austerity and the Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) gave the keynote speech at the event.

The objective of this initiative is to provide a fully digitalized platform to the business community and
individuals in approaching banks for their foreign exchange related requests. The initiative will transform
FX operations by replacing the paper-based requests with electronic submissions, which is not only efficient
but also cost effective. This development is also congruent with the Government of Pakistan’s vision of
Digital Pakistan.

Welcoming the audience, Deputy Governor State Bank Mr. Jameel Ahmad gave a brief overview of SBP’s
Knowledge Management Program to digitalize the decision-making processes at the State Bank. Deputy
Governor informed that all FX related transactions create cross border monetary and reputational
exposures for both the businesses and country and need to be well managed to avoid any unwarranted
risks. He shared with the audience that in order to address this issue, remove inherent problems related
to paper based processes and ensure timely delivery of services to the stakeholders, SBP has developed
this online platform under the umbrella of its ‘Knowledge Management System’.

The Governor, State Bank of Pakistan in his speech referred to various steps taken by State Bank of Pakistan
towards digitalization at the State Bank and in the banking industry and for enhancing ease of doing
business in the country. He informed that SBP has worked with various public and private sector entities
for providing alternate delivery channels for payments. He also mentioned that work of micropayment
gateway is at advance stage, which would revolutionize the payment spectrum in the country.

Sharing his vision on foreign exchange front, he highlighted that in order to further liberalize the foreign
exchange regime, SBP has taken several steps. It expanded the delegation of FX related requests to banks.
It includes providing ease in payments for acquisition of services from abroad by one-time registration of
contract with SBP and remittance of all subsequent payments by the banks, payments directly through the
banks for acquisition of services from digital service providers up to US $ 200,000/- per year without any
approval from SBP. It also includes registration of Foreign Currency Loans from abroad acquired by the
private sector by the banks, and facilitating exporters by allowing them to make shipments on ‘Open
Account Basis’ with direct dispatch of documents to the importer while complying with certain conditions
related to historical performance on export proceeds realizations.

In the end, he also mentioned that End-to-End digitalization of process through the commercial banks’
portals will enable customers to lodge their FX related requests from the location of their convenience
thereby sparing their valuable time previously spent in navigating the paper-based processes. Governor
Baqir appreciated the work of SBP officers as well as bank Presidents and officers for making this
digitization possible as well as several other recent schemes of the SBP to support the economy during
COVID-19

SBP and PBA issue Relief Package
for households and businesses to cope with impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

 

Amid growing concerns about the potential economic impact of the COVID — 19 pandemic, State Bank
of Pakistan (SBP) with the collaboration of Pakistan Banks Association (PBA), has announced a
comprehensive relief package. This package will help relevant stakeholders including households and
businesses (microfinance, SMEs, corporates, commercial, retail, and agriculture) to manage their
finances through this temporary phase of disruption. Key highlights of the package are as follows:

Banks’ overall pool of loanable funds has been increased. To support the banking sector to supply
additional loans to businesses and households, SBP has reduced the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)
from its existing level of 2.50% to 1.50%. This will enable banks to lend an additional amount of around
Rs. 800 billion, an amount equivalent to about 10% of their current outstanding loans. The reduced CCB
level will remain applicable till further instructions by SBP.

The regulatory limit on extension of credit to SMEs has been permanently increased. SMEs typically
bear the brunt of credit supply contractions during periods of heightened risk aversion and economic
downturn. Therefore, as a tool to incentivize banks to provide additional loans to retail SMEs, the
existing regulatory retail limit of Rs. 125 million per SME has been permanently enhanced to Rs. 180
million with immediate effect. This measure will facilitate banks to provide more loans to SMEs, which
currently stand at around Rs. 470 billion.

Borrowing limits for individuals have been increased for one year. The capacity to borrow from banks
for individuals is limited by their capacity to bear the burden of debt, defined in terms of a percentage
of their income and known as a Debt Burden Ratio (DBR). SBP has relaxed the DBR for consumer loans
from 50% to 60%. This measure will allow about 2.3 million individuals to borrow more from banks in
this time of need.

Payment of principal on loan obligations will be deferred by banks. Banks and DFls will defer the
payment of principal on loans and advances by one year. To avail this relaxation, borrowers should
submit a written request to the banks before 30"" June 2020. They will, however, continue to service
the mark-up amount as per agreed terms and conditions. The deferment of principal will not affect
borrower’s credit history and such facilities will also not be reported as restructured/rescheduled in
the credit bureau’s data. The total amount of principal coming due over the next year is about Rs. 4,700
billion.

Regulatory criteria for restructuring/rescheduling of loans have been temporarily relaxed till 31%
March 2021. For borrowers whose financial conditions require relief beyond extension of principal
repayment for one year, SBP has relaxed the regulatory criteria for restructuring/rescheduling of loans.
The loans that are re-scheduled/restructured within 180 days from the due date of payment will not
be treated as defaults. Banks would also not be required to suspend the unrealized mark-up against

State Bank of Pakistan allows financing for BMR and expansion under its
Temporary Economic Relief Facility

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has opened up it subsidized Temporary Economic Relief Facility (TERF)
for Balancing, Modernization and Replacement (BMR) and expansion of existing projects. This measure
has been taken to provide further stimulus to the economy in the context of COVID-19’s impact on the
economy, to support investment in the country for modernizing or expanding manufacturing /
production units, and in response from feedback from stakeholders.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, SBP has taken several measures to safeguard economic activity in the
country. On March 17, 2020 SBP introduced TERF and its Shariah compliant version to stimulate new
investment in manufacturing sector. Under this scheme, SBP provides refinance to banks for their
onward extension of financing at maximum end-user rate of 7 percent for 10 years. The maximum
financing for a single project under the Scheme is Rs. 5 billion. The objective of this facility is to boost
economic activity through investments in manufacturing units.

While allowing BMR and expansion of existing projects, SBP has allowed financing for purchase of new
imported and locally manufactured plant and machinery against foreign LC and inland LC. The funding
under the facility cannot be used for procurement of second-hand machinery, land or carrying out civil
works. Further, SBP has also introduced additional internal and external checks and controls to ensure
proper utilization of funds. Further details on this measure are available in the SBP circular available at:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL9.htm

With expansion in scope of the facility, SBP expects that existing businesses will avail this subsidized
funding to improve productivity of their business projects leading to higher economic activity and
employment generation.

A complete list of the measures taken by the SBP to support the economy and public health since the
outbreak of COVID-19 is available at: http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp. If end-users would like
further information on these SBP measures in the context of COVID-19 or if they are experiencing issues
with commercial banks in benefiting from these measures, they can contact a dedicated COVID-19 SBP
team by email at covid19.stimulus@sbp.org.pk or by phone at 111-727-273. End-users are encouraged
to review the material available at the above webpage including relevant circulars and any available
FAQs before contacting the SBP for further information.

Monetary Policy Statement
November 23, 2020

1. At its meeting on 23 November 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the
policy rate at 7 percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in September, the domestic recovery has
gradually gained traction, in line with expectations for growth of slightly above 2 percent in FY21, and

business sentiment has improved further. Nevertheless, there are risks to the outlook. The recent rise in
Covid cases in Pakistan and many other countties presents considerable downside risks. On the upside, while
it could take some time to fully implement worldwide, there has been recent encouraging news on vaccine
development. On the inflation front, recent out-turns have been on the higher side, primarily due to increases
in food prices. However, these supply-side pressures are likely to be temporary and average inflation is
expected to fall within the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for FY21. Taken together, risks to the
outlook for both growth and inflation appear balanced.

2. Given the broadly unchanged outlook for growth and inflation, the MPC viewed the existing stance o
monetaty policy as appropriate to support the nascent recovery while keeping inflation expectations well-

 

anchored and maintaining financial stability. The MPC noted that the lagged effects of the significant fiscal
monetary and credit stimulus injected during the pandemic should continue to shore up growth in coming
quarters.

3. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Real sector

4. Recent data suggest a further strengthening and broadening of the recovery observed since July, led by
construction and manufacturing. Sales of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) rebounded in FY21 Q1,
average sales volumes of POL and automobiles have surpassed their pre-Covid levels of FY20, and cement
sales are at an all-time high. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) continues to rebound, expanding by 4.8 percent
(y/y) in FY21 Q1, against a contraction of 5.5 percent in the same quarter last year. Nine out of fifteen major
manufacturing sectors have shown gains, including textiles, food and beverages, petroleum products, paper
and board, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, cement, fertilizer, and rubber products. The MPC noted that the
recovery was being supported by stimulus provided by the government, the round of policy rate cuts and the
SBP’s timely measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID pandemic. These measures included principal
extension and loan restructuring, payroll financing, and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF)
which injected liquidity, reduced layoffs and provided incentives for investment. In agriculture, the impact of
the expected decline in cotton production is likely to be offset by growth in other major crops and higher
wheat production due to the rise in support prices and recently announced subsidies on fertilizers and
pesticides. While social distancing continues to weigh more heavily on certain parts of the services sector,
wholesale and retail trade and transportation are expected to benefit from the knock-on impacts of the on-
going pick-up in construction, manufacturing and agriculture.

Monetary Policy Statement
April 16, 2020

1. At its last meeting on 24» March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted the worsening
outlook for global and domestic economic activity in the wake of the Corona pandemic. Given the unfolding
situation, the MPC noted that it “remains ready to take whatever further actions become necessary in

response to the evolving economic impact of the Coronavirus.”

2. Since the last MPC meeting, the global and domestic outlook has further deteriorated. The world
economy is expected to enter into the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression, contracting by as much
as 3 percent in 2020, according to projections released this week by the IMF. This is a much deeper recession

    

o

an the 0.07 percent contraction during the global financial crisis in 2009. Moreover, there are severe risks of

 

a wotse outcome. In addition, global oil prices have plummeted further, with futures markets suggesting low
prices will persist. Domestically, high-frequency indicators of activity—including retail sales, credit card
spending, cement production, export orders, tax collections, and mobility data from Google’s recently

ntroduced Community Mobility Reports—suggest a significant slowdown in most parts of the economy in recent
weeks. On the inflation front, both the March CPI out-turn and more recent weekly SPI releases in April also

show a marked reduction in inflation momentum.

3. While there is exceptionally high uncertainty about the severity and duration of the Coronavirus shock,

the developments discussed above imply further downward revision in the outlook for growth and inflation.
The economy is expected to contract by -1.5 percent in FY20 before recovering to around 2 percent growth
in FY21. Inflation is expected to be close to the lower end of the previously announced 11-12 percent range

 

this fiscal year, and to fall to 7-9 percent range next fiscal year. While there are some upside risks to headline
inflation in case of temporary supply disruptions or food price shocks, these are unlikely to generate strong
second-round effects due to the weakness of the economy. Similarly, the inflationary impact of the recent
exchange rate depreciation is expected to be contained given low import demand and falling global prices.

4. In light of this reduction in growth and inflation expectations, the MPC decided at its emergency meeting
today, to cut the policy rate by a further 200 basis points to 9 percent. This reduces forward looking real
interest rates (defined as the policy rate less expected inflation) to around zero, which is about the middle of
the range across most emerging markets. The MPC was of the view that this action would cushion the impact
of the Coronavirus shock on growth and employment, including by easing borrowing costs and the debt
service burden of households and firms, while also maintaining financial stability. It would also help ensure
that economic activity is better placed to recover when the pandemic subsides.

5. The MPC highlighted that this rate cut would complement other measures recently taken by the SBP to
support the economy, including concessional financing to companies that do not lay off workers, one-year
extension in principal payments, doubling of the period for rescheduling of loans from 90 to 180 days, and
concessional financing for hospitals and medical centers incurring expenses to combat the Coronavirus
pandemic.

SBP takes measures to support exporters affected by loss of demand due to COVID-19

SBP has a strategic objective to support exports for sustained improvement in Pakistan’s balance of
payments and growth. To this end SBP provides refinance to banks to provide cheap credit at interest
rates that vary between 3 to 6 percent to exporters for working capital and new projects under
Export Finance Schemes (EFS) and Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) schemes. The total subsidized
credit to exporters outstanding under both these schemes is currently approximately Rs. 660 billion.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Pakistan’s exporters are facing declining demand in overseas markets
and problems in executing existing orders. To support exporters in these circumstances and to
prevent current liquidity problems from turning into solvency problems amongst exporters, SBP has
announced following several measures today.

Relaxation in matching amount. Availing cheaper credit under EFS is linked with the export
performance. Currently, exporters are required to export twice the amount of borrowed funds. In
case of failure in meeting the requirement penalties are imposed and the credit limit for the next year
is also reduced accordingly. SBP has reduced the performance requirement from twice to one-and-a-
half times that will be effective for the current year as well as for FY21.

Extension in time period to meet performance requirements. Exporters were required to show
performance under the EFS schemes by end-June 2020. This period has been extended by 6 months
to end Dec. 2020. Since the additional period will also be counted towards setting new limits, this will
help the exporters in availing higher limits for FY21.

Extension in time period to ship goods. Exporters availing the subsidized credit schemes are required
to ship their goods within 6 months of availing credit under EFS. In case of failure, penalties are
imposed. This period has been extended from six to twelve months. Therefore, exporters will not be
liable to pay penalties due to breach of this condition during January to June 2020.

Relaxation in conditions for Long Term Financing Facility. Exporters who want to avail credit under
Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) are required to have exports worth 50 percent, or USD 5 million,
of the total sales to become eligible. This limit has been reduced to 40 percent or USD4 million for all
the borrowings under LTTF during the period January 01, 2020 to September 30, 2020. Moreover,
under the requirement of annual projected exports performance for four years to avail LTFF for new
or BMR projects has been extended by another one year. Now the projected exports performance
will be measured in 5 years.

Other relaxations. Another major relaxation has been provided to the exporters on foreign exchange
side. Keeping in view the difficulties faced by the exporters, SBP has also allowed banks to enhance
the time period for realization of exports proceeds from existing requirement of 180 days to 270
days on a case by case basis where the delay is related to COVID-19. This would help exporters to
provide extended time to their buyers in making payment due to above pandemic. Likewise, to

Ministry of Finance and State Bank of Pakistan introduce risk-sharing mechanism to
support bank lending to SMEs and small businesses to avail SBP’s Refinance Facility to

Support Employment

 

Taking cognizance of the SMEs finding difficulties in arranging adequate collateral and banks’
risk averseness in taking exposures for such lending under the SBPs Refinance Scheme to
Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers, Ministry of Finance has stepped forward
to shoulder risk sharing with banks. Accordingly, the Federal Government has allocated Rs30
billion under a credit risk sharing facility for the banks spread over four years to share the
burden of losses due to any bad loans in future. Under thisrisk sharing arrangement, Federal
Government will bear 40% first loss on principal portion of disbursed loan portfolio of the
banks. This facility will incentivize banks to extend loans to collateral deficient SMEs and small
corporates with sales turnover of upto Rs2 billion to avail financing under SBP refinance
scheme.

Under the SBP’s Refinance Scheme to Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers
due to the impact of COVID-19, businesses that commit to not lay off workers in the next
three months can avail credit through banks for the three months of wages and salaries
expenses at a concessional markuprate.

The risk-sharing mechanism being introduced today, that is expected to increase the banks’
incentive to lend to SMEs and small corporate under this scheme, was developed on the basis
of feedback received from relevant stakeholders and in collaboration between MOF and SBP.
Ministry of Finance’s swift approval ofthe subsidy to provide risk coverage to banks has made
it possible for the SBP to launchthis credit risksharing facility for which relevant circular has
been issued today.

SBP will continue to monitor the implementation of the scheme.

SBP calls meeting of Bank Presidents on Naya Pakistan Housing Program

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Dr. Reza Baqir called a meeting of Banks today for
deliberations on the measures proposed by Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority
(NAPHDA) and identify way forward to ensure sustainable market-led financing of housing projects
and mortgages. The meeting was chaired by the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, and attended by
Chairman NAPHDA, Lt. General Anwar Ali Haider, and members of the think tank formed by the
government including Mr. Shaukat Tareen, Mr. Arif Habib and Mr. Aqeel Karim Dhedhi among others.
Banks were represented by their respective presidents. Governor Baqir at the outset praised the work
of Lt. General Anwar Ali Haider and NAPHDA for its significant potential contribution in meeting the
shortage of housing in the country and accelerating economic activity in the country.

Governor Baqir said that housing finance has not only remained under-developed in Pakistan as
compared with other emerging economies but seen little progress over time. In this regard,
therefore, this initiative is of great national interest. He emphasized that the construction and
housing sectors have strong linkages with the rest of the economic sectors and offer a commercially
viable and long term business proposition for banks. He also stressed that supporting economic
activity in these sectors would support economic growth and particularly employment in current
times of economic stress. He encouraged banks to view housing and construction finance as an
opportunity to broaden their balance sheet and cater to the huge financing needs of the sector.
Governor Bagqir reiterated central bank’s commitment to play a facilitative and supportive role while
also supporting a healthy credit culture in the country.

Chairman NAPHDA made a presentation to the banks on the key features of Naya Pakistan Housing
Program. He shared the details of the underlying development model for the successful
implementation of the initiative. Complementing the presentation, Mr. Shaukat Tarin, member of the
government’s think tank, presented a financial model and elaborated the incentives being offered by
the government and emphasized that these will make the financing of developers and mortgages
commercially attractive for banks.

The presidents of banks in their deliberations appreciated the Naya Pakistan Housing Program and
expressed their readiness for participating in this initiative of national importance. They also made
queries and suggestions in this regard. It was decided that banks, NAPHDA, and SBP would work
together to prepare an overall roadmap and execution plans with support from the relevant sub-
committees of Pakistan Banks Association.

President of Pakistan appreciates SBP for the leadership role in promoting
financial inclusion of women and digital payments

 

 

The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, has appreciated the Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr.
Reza Baqir, for leading the initiatives of SBP in the areas of women empowerment through financial
inclusion and expanding the landscape of digital payments in the country. He was addressing an online
meeting with Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir, SAPM on Poverty Alleviation and
Social Safety, Dr Sania Nishtar, senior SBP officials, Presidents/CEOs of banks and other stakeholders.
On Women Empowerment, Governor SBP gave a detailed briefing to the President about a number of
regulatory and financing measures to enhance the flow of financial services to women. He said that
SBP has been providing financing, under its subsidized Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for
Women Entrepreneurs, since 2017 to facilitate women owned startups and small scale businesses by
providing loans of up to Rs5 million. To particularly benefit the women of Balochistan encouraging
them to avail loans under this scheme, he apprised the President, that a quota of 20% has been
reserved for women entrepreneurs of Balochistan.

Adding further, Governor Baqir shared that SBP’s efforts are aligned with the Government’s priorities
of encouraging self-employment as, under the Prime Minister Kamyab Jawan Youth Entrepreneurship
Scheme, a quota of 25% has also been reserved for women. He remarked that SBP is collaborating with
Ehsaas program to implement the Prime Minister’s vision of having ‘One Woman One Account’ beyond
the existing facility of cash disbursements through branchless banking agents only. He also highlighted
the key features of SBP’s upcoming ‘Banking on Equality’ Policy, which would engender equality in
banking and reduce gender gap in financial inclusion.

On digital payments, the Governor SBP briefed the President on various initiatives to promote it in the
country. He elaborated SBP’s multipronged strategy including developing an interoperable and digital
payments infrastructure, providing enabling legal and regulatory environment, ensuring security of
digital payment channels and finally promoting and experimenting with new technologies and fintechs
companies. Sharing numbers on the progress of digital payments, Governor Baqir updated the
President that digital transactions in Pakistan have seen an upward trend in recent years. He
highlighted that, during FY20, 906 million transactions amounting to Rs66 trillion were processed
through retail e-Banking channels, whereas internet-banking channels processed 57 million
transactions amounting to Rs3 trillion. He added that a promising growth could also be witnessed in
mobile banking with 3 million new users added within one year and overall number of transactions of
83 million worth Rs2 trillion during FY20. Further, e-commerce transactions amounting to Rs35 billion
were conducted and bill payments worth Rs213 billion were made by consumers using digital payment
channels in Pakistan.

The President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, thanked Governor for SBP’s efforts and progress on women
empowerment and promotion of digital payments. He also acknowledged the role of MPG in unlocking
the potential for economic benefits. He also appreciated the idea that the young female entrepreneurs
with large social media following may be identified as brand ambassadors to create awareness among
public about SBP policies and products for promoting gender financial inclusion.

SAPM, Dr. Sania Nishtar thanked SBP for its support on facilitation of Ehsaas beneficiaries through

Branchless Banking. She further added that they are working with SBP on use of micro payment
gateway for facilitating digital payments to Ehsaas beneficiaries.

SBP gives mandatory targets to banks to increase housing & construction
financing to at least 5% of private sector credit by December 2021

To promote housing and construction of buildings activities in the country, as envisaged by the
Government of Pakistan (GoP), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to set a mandatory target for
banks to extend mortgage loans and financing for developers and builders. Banks will be required to
increase their housing and construction of building loan portfolios to at least 5 percent of their private
sector credit by the end of December 2021.

Due to significant shortages in meeting the annual additional demand of housing facilities by its citizens,
a huge shortfall of housing units has accumulated over the years in the country. Filling this gap is
important to improve quality of living conditions for common people and construction of housing with
linkages to dozens of allied industries offers substantial potential for boosting economic activities in
the country. This, however, requires considerable amount of financing to meet the investment needs
of this sector. In Pakistan, bank financing for mortgages and housing construction is less than one
percent of GDP which is one of the lowest in the region. Banks have remained reluctant over the years
to extend mortgage financing for various reasons. Keeping in view the need for housing and its
contribution to the economy, GoP is aiming to increase the number of housing units manifold in the
coming years and has recently announced several measures including commitment to remove hurdles
in mortgage and construction financing.

To play its due role in enhancing financing to the housing and construction of building activities, SBP is
also taking several measures in consultation with key stakeholders. A high level Steering Committee,
under the Chairmanship of Governor SBP and with representation from Chairman NAPHDA (Naya
Pakistan Housing Development Authority), several bank Presidents and other stakeholders, is meeting
every week to resolve issues and follow up on decisions to promote mortgage and construction
financing, especially for NAPHDA projects. The Steering Committee has five sub-committees dedicated
for various work streams with multiple operational level groups working at a fast pace.

In today’s announcement, while issuing mandatory targets, banks have been asked to gear up
appropriately by developing their infrastructure and capacity to meet these targets. SBP has instructed
banks to present a concrete action plan to SBP, within 15 working days, containing quarterly targets,
development of products, media campaigns, development of technology infrastructure, and capacity
building of staff, amongst other areas. Banks have also been directed to report data of approvals and
disbursements against the targets on monthly basis starting from September 2020. For details:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C10.htm

SBP believes that several measures on the part of government will support bank financing for housing
and construction related sectors. These include passage of an efficient foreclosure law and its effective
implementation, automation and computerization of land and property records for facilitation of clean
title for bank lending and reduction in time taken in registration of title & creation/perfection of
mortgages, creation of a Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to address bank concerns of ensuring
adequate standards of developers and builders, and reduction in transaction cost related to property
transfers.

Seminar on Managing Crises in Emerging Markets

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) hosted a seminar on “Managing Crises in Emerging Markets” in
collaboration with the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) in Karachi yesterday. The seminar was
attended by policy makers, financial sector specialists, researchers, government officials, heads of
commercial banks, eminent business persons, academics, and the media.

In his welcoming remarks, the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, stated that the objective of holding the
seminar was two-fold. First, to demonstrate that, in addition to its mandate of formulating monetary,
exchange rate and financial stability policies, SBP endeavors to facilitate constructive debate on
economic issues and is open to diverse points of view. Second, to highlight that Pakistan is not unique
and there are many other emerging economies that have also faced economic crises and undergone
difficult adjustments.

Mr. Athanasios Arvanitis, Deputy Director of the International Monetary Fund, delivered the keynote
speech. His speech was followed by a panel discussion in which Mr. Ehsan Malik, CEO of PBC, Mr.
Sakib Sherani, CEO of Macro Economic Insights and Mr. Khurram Husain, a renowned journalist at
Dawn, participated. The seminar ended with a question and answer session with the audience.

In his address, Mr. Arvanitis highlighted some of the main similarities of crises across emerging
markets, notably the role typically played by elevated levels of debt, high public and external deficits,
inflexible exchange rates, lack of competitiveness, low saving and investment, and maturity and
currency mismatches. Despite these similarities, he emphasized that there was no one-size-fits-all
model for managing crises. Instead, the IMF focuses on different dimensions while assisting a country
in developing a homegrown stabilization program. The approach emphasizes the need to diagnose
the roots of a country’s crisis, trends and developments in the balance sheets of various economic
agents and their interconnectedness, and country-specific dynamics that affect the political economy
of reforms. In terms of designing stabilization programs, Mr. Arvanitis stressed the importance of
country ownership and measures to provide support for vulnerable segments of the population. He
also drew parallels for Pakistan from the experiences of managing crises in other emerging countries.

Referring to the IMF program with Pakistan, Mr. Arvanitis remarked that it is important for the
government to focus on meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the UN’s 2030
Agenda. He noted that ongoing fiscal reforms will not only put Pakistan’s public debt path ona
sustainable footing but also build the foundation for providing crucial funding to meet these targets.

In the panel discussion, Mr. Ehsan Malik presented the business community’s perspective on
prevailing economic conditions and policies in Pakistan. While complimenting SBP’s adoption of a
market-based exchange rate mechanism and the improving security situation in Pakistan, he
highlighted the skewed tax burden on the manufacturing sector and the need to put in place a
national tariff policy that prioritizes industrial promotion in the country instead of revenue
generation. Mr. Malik also highlighted the business community's concerns about the level of interest
rates in the country.

Mr. Sakib Sherani highlighted various factors that he felt explained why Pakistan’s economic growth
has historically not been steered towards a balanced trajectory despite the implementation of
multiple IMF programs. In particular, he drew attention to the under-appreciation of initial conditions
and negative feedback loops while designing these programs. He agreed with the idea of adopting

Prime Minister Inaugurates Roshan Digital Account — An Initiative of SBP

Prime Minister Imran Khan today inaugurated the Roshan Digital Account in a ceremony in Islamabad. The
Roshan Digital Account is a new initiative of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in partnership with major
banks in Pakistan.

The Roshan Digital Account is for non-resident Pakistanis (NRPs). Through this account, NRPs will be fully
integrated with Pakistan’s banking and payments system. For the first time in the country’s history, NRPs
will be able to open an account in Pakistan without requiring physical presence either in Pakistan or in any
embassy or consulate. This account will provide them access to a full range of banking services and exciting
investment opportunities in Pakistan from wherever they live, including the soon to be launched Naya
Pakistan Certificates issued by the government, as well as the stock market and real estate. Funds in these
accounts will also be fully repatriable, such that they can be remitted back from Pakistan without any prior
approval from SBP.

Addressing the audience, the Prime Minister dedicated the occasion to overseas Pakistanis, noting that
they have always made Pakistan proud through their achievements and dedication to their motherland.
He was delighted that SBP was offering a new channel to connect overseas Pakistanis with their
motherland financially and congratulated the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir, on this initiative.

The Prime Minister called overseas Pakistanis the greatest resource of the country. He said that in many
parts of the world, expatriates have played an important role in the development of their countries.
However, he regretted that Pakistan has historically been unable to tap its diaspora effectively. However,
he remarked that his government is committed to better integrating overseas Pakistanis into the local
economy, and that the Roshan Digital Account is very important first step in this direction.

The Prime Minister highlighted that the country needs more investment from abroad to fund the current
account deficit and raise foreign exchange reserves. In this context, he remarked that overseas Pakistanis
can help the country by investing in recently announced mega projects of the country through the Roshan
Digital Account. In particular, he emphasized the on-going boom in the housing sector, which provides
very attractive investment opportunities for overseas Pakistanis.

In his address, Governor SBP Dr. Reza Baqir noted that the Roshan Digital Account represents a new era in
the banking system of Pakistan, as it features a completely digital on-boarding process. To enable this
historic change, SBP introduced all the necessary amendments to existing rules and regulations. He
explained that these accounts will initially be available through eight major banks in Pakistan, with more
banks added in due course.

The Governor said that today we have crossed another milestone as part of SBP’s commitment to a digital
financial ecosystem for Pakistan’s economy and in keeping with the Prime Minister’s vision. He highlighted
that the name of the account reflected the ethos of NRPs, who make their country proud through their
hard work and passion. It is to these star performers abroad that the “Roshan” account is dedicated, he
said.

The Governor highlighted that opening the account will require a basic set of information and documents.
Banks have been asked to complete all necessary customer due diligence within 48 hours after receiving
complete information. He assured NRPs that SBP and the banks were committed to providing them a
world-class user experience and to proactively resolving any problems they may encounter during the roll-
out of the initiative. In this context, he highlighted the dedicated customer support and monitoring system
established by SBP and the banks.

SBP jointly organizes seminar on Firms and Growth

 

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir, has said that there is a need to shift from an
inward oriented to an outward oriented economy that puts a greater emphasis on exports to achieve
high and sustained growth. He was addressing the audience of a day-long seminar on ‘Firms and
Growth’ organized jointly by SBP, the International Growth Center (IGC), the Consortium for
Development Policy Research (CDPR) and the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) at SBP Karachi on 13°
January, 2020.

Giving his introductory remarks in the first session of the seminar, the Governor illustrated in his
presentation the inward oriented focus of Pakistan’s historical economic growth that has relied
primarily on domestic consumption. He elaborated that Pakistan’s comparator countries have relied to
a larger extent than Pakistan on exports as an engine of growth. He noted that the top 25 percent of
emerging markets and developing countries have grown at an average rate of 7 percent since 2001. To
reach this average growth rate it was critical for Pakistan to achieve significantly higher export growth.

Amongst other issues, Dr. Bagir discussed two considerations in determining the outlook for exports:
exchange rate and export diversification. On the exchange rate he noted that addressing exchange rate
overvaluation has helped to boost the country’s exports. He also noted that while the exchange rate
had done its part more fundamental growth in exports needed to come from structural reforms beyond
the exchange rate. In this context Dr. Baqir also contrasted the experience of different countries with
export diversification. Comparing the structure of Pakistan’s exports between 2004 and 2017, Dr. Baqir
noted that Pakistan’s exports had largely remain concentrated in very few sectors. Furthermore,
Pakistan’s exports began to decline starting around 2012. Citing the examples of some successful
exporting countries, he emphasised on the need to go beyond the traditional commodities of textile
and agriculture and the importance of export diversification.

Dr. Abdul Hafeez Sheikh also addressed the seminar and discussed measures being taken by the
government to improve the business environment. He also emphasised the role of export
diversification and that government was committed to work in partnership with the private sector to
address the factors which had previously constrained Pakistan’s growth. Mr. Asad Umar spoke about
the commitment of the new government to improving job creation and competitiveness, and to put an
end to the several policy biases of the government. He highlighted governments’ protection of
uncompetitive sectors over the past many years which remained detrimental to economic growth.

The morning session on “Moving from an Inward- to an Outward-looking Economy” began with
introductory remarks by Dr. ljaz Nabi (Country Director IGC; Chairperson CDPR). Dr. Ijaz Nabi stressed
the importance of improving the export strategy to ensure sustainable growth, and the role of fiscal
responsibility to avoid recurrent external account crises. After address of eminent speakers, a panel
discussion with Ehsan Malik (CEO, PBC), Annabel Gerry (Head of DFID Pakistan), and Gonzalo Varela
(Senior Trade Economist, World Bank) ensued. Overall, the session highlighted the importance of
creating an outward looking economy and the different contours of an export-oriented economic
strategy that Pakistan would have to adopt in order to remain competitive in the international market,
especially with regards to countries such as India and Bangladesh.

Workers’ Remittances Remain Strong in August

 

e In August, workers’ remittances remained above $2 billion for the third month in a row. They
reached $ 2.095 billion, which is 24.4 percent higher than during the same month last year and
largely in line with SBP projections.

. Over the last three months, remittances reached an unprecedented level of $7.3
billion, 37.2 percent higher than the same period last year.

° Efforts under the Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) and the gradual re-opening of
businesses in major host countries such as Middle East, Europe and United States contributed
to this increase.

° The top three originating countries for remittances in August were: Saudi Arabia ($0.593
billion), UAE ($0.410 billion) and UK ($0.302 billion)

° Ona m/m basis, remittances were 24.3 percent lower than the record level of remittances of
S 2.768 billion posted in July, mainly reflecting the usual seasonal decline in the post Eid-al-
Adha period.

Availability of SBP Helpline for customers of banks and public warning against fraudsters calling for
personal information citing situation under COVID-19

SBP has taken additional measures to facilitate bank customers that are faced with extraordinary
challenges arising out of COVID-19 situation in the country. They can now approach SBP through its
helpline service in case their queries or complaints are not being responded by banks. SBP also
encourages public to use digital payment services as much as possible to help banks providing their
services with minimal staff to ensure their safety.SBP has taken notice of phone calls to
banks’ customers by fraudsters seeking personal information taking advantage of the current
conditions. Following are the details of measures taken.

Availability of Helpline: To facilitate banking consumers, SBP has advised all banks to ensure that their
call centers/helplines are available 24/7 for instant customer support. Banking consumers are
encouraged to approach banks through helpline for queries orlodging complaints. In
case complainants do not get an appropriate response from banks, they mayapproach SBP
helpline at 021-111-727-273, which will remain available during office hours. To cater to the needs
of the public for facilitation and guidance, SBP has enhanced its helpline capacity by deploying more
agents at its call center.

Implementation of safety measures: The general public is encouraged to take appropriate safety
measures in the context of the Corona Virus and use alternate delivery channels where possible. SBP
recognizes that the employees of banks and other financial institutions are providing services amid the
difficult working conditions arising due to COVID-19. For the protection of bank employees and
customers, work place safety and to meet the operational challenges in serving the bank
customers, banks have been advised to implement guidelines issued by World Health Organization, the
Government of Pakistan and the Provincial Governments in letter and spirit. Nevertheless, bank
employees and customers still facing difficulties or having concerns over arrangements may bring this
to the notice of SBP. For this purpose, queries, concerns, complaints may be emailed to SBP

information about their bank accounts or credit/debit cards including CNIC number, debit or credit
card number, passwords, PINs and one-time password (OTP), etc. on incoming phone calls or
messages. It has been brought to the notice of SBP that fraudsters, imitating as officials of SBP, bank
or any other government agency, have been attempting to seek personal

the year 2021. IFSB Council is the highest level policy making body comprising of the Central Bank
Governors and heads of the leading regulatory and supervisory authorities. The announcement was

Malaysia, and was attended by the Central Bank Governors and heads of Regulatory and Supervisory
Authorities of more than 20 countries. During the meeting, Governor Dr. Reza also participated in a
tour de table discussion on economic and financial stability under COVID-19 pandemic. He shared with
the Council members the measures taken by State Bank in combating COVID-19 challenges by providing
required liquidity support to banks through various regulatory interventions and concessionary
refinance schemes to businesses through banks to avoid layoffs, direct support for hospitals and for
new investments.

The IFSB, established in 2003 at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is the international standard-setting

Financial Stability Review CY-19 suggests resilience of the
banking sector to the COVID-19 pandemic

 

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued its flagship annual publication, the Financial Stability Review
(FSR) for CY19. The Review presents performance and risk assessment of various segments of the
financial sector including banks, non-banking financial institutions, financial markets, non-financial
corporates and financial market infrastructures.

The FSR notes that the outbreak of COVID-19, the trigger for the Global Health Crisis (GHC), has had
significant consequences for the global and domestic economy. As elsewhere, the dismal impact of
COVID-19 on Pakistan is still unfolding. The country, after imposing lockdowns, has moved towards
easing some of the restrictions, amid rising levels of infection. This should help provide support to
economic activity.

In order to limit risks and facilitate stakeholders, SBP has taken a host of policy measures. These
measures include substantial monetary easing, release of capital buffers, deferment of the repayment
of principal loan amount for corporate, SMEs, and household borrowers, restructuring/rescheduling of
loans, concessionary financing to save jobs and boost health care to combat COVID-19, ensuring
availability and continuity of financial services, and reduction in payment system related costs. These
measures have started bearing results as banks have approved debt deferment of around PKR 495
billion and rescheduling/restructuring of PKR 70 billion to around seven hundred thousand borrowers.
Under the refinance scheme to avoid layoffs, around PKR 93 billion have been approved for 1172
companies covering about eight hundred and fifty thousand employees. A complete list of the
measures taken so far and the outcomes are available on  SBP’s_ website
(http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp).

Going forward, the pace and extent of global and domestic economic revival are inextricably tied to the
trajectory of Covid-19. Against this backdrop, SBP is keeping a close watch on developments and stands
ready to take all policy actions in its domain to safeguard the economic and financial stability.

Overall, it is encouraging that the strong capital buffers built over the years have significantly enhanced
the resilience of Pakistan’s banking sector. Stress tests conducted in the FSR suggests that the banking
sector should remain resilient to the Covid-19 shock under most reasonable shock scenarios, reflecting
the strong capital and liquidity positions of the majority of banks as discussed below.

In terms of performance last year, the FSR suggests that after some strains due to sluggish growth
during the early part of the year, financial sector stability started to improve towards the end of CY19.
Owing to necessary stabilization measures, macroeconomic vulnerabilities emanating from Pakistan’s
external and fiscal imbalances along with the uncertainty prevailing amongst market participants began
to recede by year-end. There were early signs of an economic revival as foreign exchange reserves
increased, the market-based exchange rate stabilized, the fiscal deficit contracted, and economic
activity, particularly the Large Scale Manufacturing, revived. Due to better sentiment, both local and
foreign investors started taking positions in the equity and bond markets of the country. As
macroeconomic stress declined, the stability of the financial sector improved.

The consolidated asset base of the financial sector expanded by 11.74 percent during CY19; higher than
the 7.46 percent growth recorded in the previous year. The major contribution in this growth came
from the banking sector, the largest segment of the financial sector. Financial markets—after remaining

SBP is all setto launch consultation on Banking on Equality policy for reducing the gender gap in
financial inclusion

Women’s access to financial and economic opportunities is essential for sustainable and inclusive
economic growth. However, women in Pakistan are disproportionately under-served by the financial
system. Only 18% percent of adult women in Pakistan have an active bank account comparedwith 51%
men. In order to address the gender disparities, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has adopted a medium-
term national target of 20 million active women bank accounts by 2023 under National Financial
Inclusion Strategy. The target will be achieved through the launch of a policy to reduce the gender gap
in financial inclusion, titled Banking on Equality, which aims to promote women financial inclusion in
Pakistan.

“Banking on Equality: Reducing the Gender Gap in Financial Inclusion”, is a flagship policy initiative of
State Bank of Pakistan for promoting women financial inclusion. The policy willintroduce a gender lens
within the financial sector through specific measures to bring a shift towards gender friendly business
practices.

To initiate a national dialogue on women financial inclusion, SBP has organized a webinar titled
“Consultative Launch of Banking on Equality policy: Reducing the Gender Gap in Financial Inclusion”
on Monday, December 21, 2020 at 1730 PKT (Pakistan Standard Time). The webinar, that willbe shown
live on State Bank’s Facebook page [https://www.facebook.com/StateBankPakistan] aims to promote
awareness of the significance of women financial inclusion and hold discussions among distinguished
international thought leaders to discuss practical ways to give a boost to women financial inclusionin
Pakistan.

 

SBP Governor, Dr. Reza Baqir will host the consultative launch of the Banking on Equality policy with
introductory presentation on the policy by SBP Deputy Governor Ms. Sima Kamil, and followed by a
high level panel discussion around women’s financial inclusion. The panel members would include
Princess Zahra Aga Khan Director Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), Ms. Ceyla Pazarbasioglu
from IMF and Dr. Reza Baqir Governor, State Bank of Pakistan while Dr. Anita Zaidi from Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (BMGF) will moderate the panel discussion.

Princess Zahra Aga Khan isa Member of the Board of Directors of the Aga Khan Development Network
(AKDN). Princess Zahra serves in various leadership roles within the Aga Khan Development Network,
including as Trustee of the Aga Khan University and the University of Central Asia.

ERD/M&PRD/PR/01/2020-24 March 17, 2020

State Bank of Pakistan announces three measures to address the economic and health
challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19

First, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the SBP cut its policy rate by 75 basis points.
As noted in the accompanying Monetary Policy Statement, the dominant development since
the last MPC meeting has been the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. This has
precipitated a slowdown in world demand and volatility in global financial markets, as well as
a steep fall in global oil prices. Together with the domestic deceleration in food prices and
significant decline in consumer price expectations, the outlook for inflation in Pakistan has
therefore improved, paving the way for today’s rate cut. The current market volatility being
experienced in Pakistan is externally driven and the strengthening in the fundamentals of
Pakistan’s economy that drove the improvement in Pakistan markets before the Coronavirus
outbreak remains intact. As a result, volatility is likely to subside as global risk aversion reduces.
The SBP stands ready to take whatever additional actions that may be necessary to safeguard
price and financial stability and support economic growth.

Second, the SBP announced a “Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF)” and its
Shariah compliant version to stimulate new investment in manufacturing. Under this
scheme, the SBP will refinance banks to provide financing at a maximum end-user rate of 7
percent for 10 years for setting up of new industrial units. The total size of the scheme is Rs
100 billion, with a maximum loan size per project of Rs 5 billion. It can be accessed by all
manufacturing industries, with the exception of the power sector, where an SBP refinance
facility for renewable energy projects already exists. In line with the SBP's other refinancing
schemes, the credit risk will be borne by banks and the selection of projects to finance will also
be determined by them. This scheme will help counter any possible delays in the setting up of
new projects that investors were planning prior to the Coronavirus outbreak. It will be available
for one year only, requiring a letter of credit (LC) to be opened by end-March 2021.

Third, the SBP announced a “Refinance Facility for Combating COVID-19 (RFCC)” and its
Shariah compliant version to support hospitals and medical centers in combating the spread
of COVID-19. Under this scheme, the SBP will refinance banks to provide financing at a
maximum end-user rate of 3 percent for 5 years for the purchase of equipment to detect,
contain and treat the Coronavirus. The SBP will provide this facility to banks at 0 percent. All
hospitals and medical centers registered with federal or provincial health agencies and which
are engaged in the control and eradication of COVID-19 will be eligible for this facility. The total
size of the scheme is Rs 5 billion, with a maximum financing limit per hospital or medical center
of Rs 200 million. This scheme will help contain the spread of the Coronavirus and reduce its
human toll. It is available until end-September 2020.

SBP enhances loan size under its refinance scheme to support women entrepreneurs

To encourage women participation in the economy, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced
the financing limit under its Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women
Entrepreneurs from Rs1.5 million to Rs5 million. The decision has been taken in light of
feedback received from various stakeholders about current financing limit being insufficient to
cover the financing needs of women entrepreneurs.

This decision is in line with the Government of Pakistan’s policy to support and revive economic
activities in the country and SBP’s key objective of improving access to finance for priority
segments including women entrepreneurs. Initially in August 2017, State Bank had introduced
Refinance and Credit Guarantee Scheme for Women Entrepreneurs in underserved areas to
promote financial inclusion and access to finance for women entrepreneurs in the country.
Subsequently, the scope of scheme was enhanced to cover whole of Pakistan. Under this
scheme, SBP provides refinance to participating financial institutions at 0% on their financing
to women entrepreneurs at maximum end user rate of 5%. Moreover, 60% risk coverage is
also available to the participating institutions.

The enhancement in financing limit under SBP scheme is expected to increase financial
inclusion of women since more women entrepreneurs are likely to be attracted for setting up
of new businesses or for expanding the scope of their existing businesses by availing
concessional financing under SBP scheme.

SBP Takes Major Steps to Boost Digital Payments in the Country

To further improve the digital payment services landscape in the country and promote financial
inclusion, SBP has issued instructions to the banking industry for improving the acceptance of payment
cards in the country. Specifically, SBP has taken three steps: one, the banks are now bound to offer the
domestic payment scheme card, PayPak, to the customers as a first priority, whereas cards of
international payment schemes like Visa, MasterCard and Union Pay may be issued on the request of
the customer. Two, the merchant discount rate (MDR) i.e. the fee charged by banks to the merchants,
will now be in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Earlier banks were allowed to charge any fee to the
merchants. Three, the distribution of revenues generated from a merchant among the players
including card issuer, card machine deploying entity and the payment scheme company, has also been
rationalised to keep the incentives equitable among all the players. These measures are expected to
increase payment card acceptance access points in the country and in turn will also help in digitizing
the economy and promoting financial inclusion.

Addressing another gap in cheque clearing whereby it took weeks to clear cheques in far flung areas of
the country, SBP has allowed the use of Pakistan Real Time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM)
for the settlement of cheques. This is expected to decrease the processing time for clearing of payment
instruments in areas that are not easily accessible. This will also help the financial institutions in far
flung areas to leverage digital channels for their clearing and settlement obligations.

It may be recalled that SBP launched the National Payment Systems Strategy in November 2019 and
has since taken a number of steps to promote digitization of payment transactions in the country.

The National Payment Systems strategy is available at http://www.sbp.org.pk/PS/PDF/NPSS.pdf

Monetary Policy Statement
June 25, 2020

1. At its meeting on 25% June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy
rate by 100 basis points to 7 percent. This decision reflected the MPC’s view that the inflation outlook has
improved further, while the domestic economic slowdown continues and downside risks to growth have
increased. Against this backdrop of receding demand-side inflation risks, the priority of monetary policy has
appropriately shifted toward supporting growth and employment during these challenging times.

2. Consistent with its mandate, the MPC re-asserted its commitment to supporting households and
businesses through the Covid-19 crisis and minimizing damage to the economy. In this context, the MPC felt
that from a risk management point of view, a prompt response to downside risks to growth was called for
given the improved inflation outlook. In addition, the MPC noted that with approximately Rs. 3.3 trillion
worth of loans due to be repriced by early July 2020, this was an opportune moment to take action from a
monetaty policy transmission perspective. In this way, the benefits of interest rate reductions would be passed

on in a timely manner to households and businesses.

3. ‘The MPC noted that the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading in many emerging markets, including Pakistan,
and there are fears of a second wave in several other countries. The MPC observed that risks to the global
outlook are heavily skewed to the downside and the path of recovery remains uncertain. The MPC also noted
that in its update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) released yesterday, the IMF downgraded its 2020
global growth forecast further to -4.9 percent, 1.9 percentage points lower than in April, and projected a more
gradual recovery than previously anticipated.

4. Domestically, the moderation of underlying inflation has continued. Notwithstanding a seasonal uptick in
food prices associated with the Eid holiday, headline inflation declined further to 8.2 percent in May on the
back of the recent cut in diesel and petrol prices. In addition, month-on-month inflation rates continue to be
low. Recent SPI data also suggests continued moderation in overall price pressures in June, despite price

 

increases in some food items, notably wheat. The FY2020/21 budget is also expected to be neutral for
inflation as the freeze on government salaries, absence of new taxes, and lower production cost from reduced
import duties should offset the decline in subsidies in some sectors. While supply shocks could create some
volatility in inflation, the MPC felt that these are likely to be transitory given weak domestic demand, such
that monetary policy should generally look past them. Given the absence of demand-side pressures, average
inflation could fall below the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for next fiscal year. With the current
reduction of the policy rate to 7 percent, the MPC felt that real rates on a forward-looking basis (defined as
the policy rate less expected inflation) would be kept close to zero, which is appropriate under the current

circumstances.

5. On the teal side, the decline in LSM deepened to 41.9 percent (y/y) in April, when lockdowns were still
in place. In May, high-frequency indicators of activity such as cement dispatches, automobile sales, food and
textile exports, and POL sales also continued to contract, although mostly at a lower rate than in the previous
two months. Looking ahead, the economy is expected to recover gradually in FY21, supported by easing
lockdowns, supportive macroeconomic policies and a pick-up in global growth. However, risks are skewed to

Banking industry join hands to create Pakistan

Corporate Restructuring Company Limited (PCRCL)

The Presidents and representatives of Habib Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank, MCB Bank,
Allied Bank, Meezan Bank, Bank Al-falah, Bank Al-Habib, Habib Metropolitan Bank and Faysal Bank
signed today the shareholders’ agreement for the establishment of Pakistan Corporate Restructuring
Company Limited (PCRCL) at State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Karachi in the presence of Governor, SBP.

Under the provisions of Corporate Restructuring Companies Act 2016 and with an initial Paid-up Capital
of Rs500 million, the above banks have decided to establish the Corporate Restructuring Company
(CRC), which is first such type of company in Pakistan. The objectives of the CRC are aligned with the
initiatives of the Government of Pakistan to revive the sick industrial units.

It would be pertinent to mention here that the CRCs, under CRC Act 2016, are empowered to acquire,
restructure and resolve the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of financial institutions and thereby
reorganize and revive the commercially or financially distressed companies. The CRCs are specialized
institutions with skillset in NPL resolution and corporate restructuring. These companies through
aggregation of NPLs, will be well positioned to negotiate with the sick units and finalize the
restructuring of loans vis-a-vis multiple lenders negotiating simultaneously with the borrower. It is
expected that CRCs will evolve as vibrant economic agent, contributing towards the revival of sick
industrial units and generating employment opportunities.

Total Non-Performing Loans of the banking industry stand at Rs758 billion as of September 30, 2019.
Total NPL amount includes the loans against such sick industrial units, which can be revived and
rehabilitated, provided the NPLs are restructured promptly and the sponsors of the sick units also inject
the fresh equity to demonstrate their willingness and commitment in the rehabilitation of sick units.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has granted the license to PCRCL on
December 31, 2019. State Bank of Pakistan appreciates the initiative of above banks and the supportive
role of the SECP in incorporation and licensing of PCRCL.

SBP is also engaged with the Federal Government to introduce amendments in the relevant laws and
to strengthen the Banking Courts in order to take forward Government’s agenda of institutional
reforms,

Converting of existing (ATM) card portfolios to EMV chip and PIN

SBP categorically rejects baseless rumors making the rounds in a section of press that the existing
ATM cards with magnetic stripe have stopped working since December 31, 2019. SBP has not issued
any such instruction to card issuers (Banks/MFBs). Customers who have still not received their
Europay Mastercard Visa (EMV-Chip and PIN) cards can continue using their existing magnetic stripe
cards till the time they have received and activated their new cards. However, based on activation
and delivery trends, the card issuers may block existing magnetic stripe cards to ensure complete
migration to EMV (Chip and PIN) at a future date.

We would like to recall that SBP vide PSD Circular Letter No. 09 of 2018 had advised all Banks/MFBs
to re-card their existing card portfolios to EMV chip and PIN by June 30, 2019. However, upon the
request of the industry the timeline was revised to December 31, 2019 vide PSD Circular Letter No. 01
of 2019.

SBP has also allowed numerous Banks/MEBs to utilize Alternate Delivery Channels (ADCs) other than
call centers like Mobile Banking, Internet Banking and ATMs etc. for payment card activation
purposes. The move is aimed at easing the pressure on the call centers (which are used by customers
for activation of their cards) and to facilitate customers of Banks/MFBs.

SBP reiterates that it will continue making all out efforts to ensure timely and seamless migration of
customers from magnetic stripe to the more secure EMV (Chip and PIN) standard.

SBP introduces a transparent mechanism with complete delegation to banks for remitting
disinvestment proceeds to facilitate foreign direct investment

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a new mechanism to enable companies in Pakistan to
conveniently remit out disinvestment proceeds to their foreign shareholders. The goal of this initiative is
to make Pakistan a more attractive place for investment by increasing investors’ confidence and support
ease of doing business. The new mechanism also incorporates feedback received from investors and other
stakeholders.

As per the previous mechanism, a designated bank required prior approval of the State Bank for
remittance of disinvestment proceeds above market value, for listed securities and, above breakup value,
for unlisted securities. This requirement presented numerous constraints for investors.

Under the new mechanism, the bank designated by the company has been delegated the authority to
remit the entire disinvestment proceeds to non-resident shareholders, upon submission of required
documents, by following a convenient mechanism without referring the case to SBP. The number of
required documents would be in accordance with the size of the transaction.

e For disinvestment proceeds not exceeding the market value / break-up value, the required
documents would include copy of Share Purchase Agreement, broker’s memo in case of quoted
shares/break-up value certificate of a QCR rated practicing Chartered Accountant in case of
unlisted shares, latest audited financials of the company, signed M-Form, and an undertaking
from the buyer that in case the transaction is between related parties, the same has been
concluded at an arms-length basis.

e For disinvestment proceeds exceeding the market value / break-up value, the additional required
documents would include a detailed valuation/ transaction due diligence by the buyer showing
basis, methodology and key valuation metrics used for valuation. In case the total remittance of
disinvestment proceeds exceeds US Dollar 50 million (or equivalent in other currencies) during a
span of six months, the applicant shall also submit an independent review of the buyer’s valuation,
from QCR rated practicing chartered accountant, that shall be assessed by the designated bank
without needing to send to the SBP.

This initiative of State Bank will increase the investors’ confidence and would facilitate the local
companies in particular the start-ups to attract more foreign investment for their businesses. The
circular issued to banks announcing these measures can be accessed at the following link:

SBP ISSUES REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO FACILITATE
BUSINESS TO CONSUMER (B2C) E-COMMERCE EXPORTS

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued regulatory framework to facilitate Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
e-Commerce exports from Pakistan. Under the new regulatory framework, the mandatory requirement
of ‘Export’ (E) form has been done away with and now an exporter can export goods up to USD 5,000/-
per consignment without the requirement of ‘E’ Form. This step will facilitate exports in small quantities
directly to the consumers. This will also help small entrepreneurs and exporters who typically export
varied goods in small quantities and find it cumbersome to fulfill the detailed requirements of E Form
that is mainly designed for bulk exports.

Lately, the global emerging trends especially in the consumer market place have seen a major shift
from traditional market place to e-commerce due to the advent of new technologies. A surge in this
trend was particularly witnessed during the global lockdown owing to COVID-19 pandemic. In line with
these trends, SBP focused on facilitating cross border trade for B2C (Business to Consumer) exports
from Pakistan, including by small entrepreneurs and exporters. This was aimed at improving
competitiveness and digital connectivity of Pakistani businesses with the global market during the
development phase of e-Commerce Policy.

It merits mentioning here that up till now, goods from Pakistan could only be exported after
certification of Electronic/ Manual Export (‘E’) Form-E by the Authorized Dealers (ADs) and subsequent
filing of Goods Declaration by the customers with Pakistan Customs. The ‘E’ Form was required for each
shipment with complete description of the goods being exported and had been designed keeping in
view the export of large quantities of homogenous goods. However, for exports of small value different
items to individuals destined for different jurisdiction, (as is the case in B2C e-commerce exports) the
existing process was not conducive.

Earlier, in 2000, SBP had issued regulatory instructions to promote B2C e-Commerce, in Foreign
Exchange Manual, with primary focus on opening of Internet Merchant Account to facilitate e-
commerce. However, with advancement in technology, these instructions needed to cater to the
current business dynamics of e-commerce and therefore required to be replaced. Accordingly, SBP
collaborated with the relevant stakeholders including business community, Pakistan Customs, Ministry
of Commerce, courier companies and banking industry in a bid to develop a regulatory framework,
which not only addresses the market needs but also takes into account regulatory objectives.

The new regulatory framework would address the pressing demand of e-commerce exporters,
including the small entrepreneurs, besides providing the much needed impetus for the recognition and
growth of e-commerce exports from Pakistan. It would also pave the way for the big corporate brands,
SMEs, and startups, to enter the global consumer markets and contribute to the exports earning of the
country. The new regulatory framework is expected to be beneficial in improving country's rating in
the Ease of Doing Business index. Moreover, this framework would also help in documenting the
exports of small shipments, which earlier could not be included in the formal exports of the country
due to absence of any such framework.

The instructions are available at: https://www.sbp.org.pk/epd/2020/FEC7.htm

State Bank reinforces its support to health sector in fight against COVID-19

In the background of rising cases of COVID-19 in the country and with the need to strengthen health
sector in fight against COVID-19, SBP today enhanced financing limit of a single hospital/ medical center
under its Refinance Facility for Combating COVID -19 (RFCC) from Rs. 200 million to Rs. 500 million.

RFCC is an emergency funding facility to support hospitals/medical centers to develop their capacities
for treatment of infected patients of COVID-19. The financing under this facility is being made available
by State Bank at 0% to banks that can charge a maximum rate of 3% per annum to hospitals/medical
centers. State Bank has been continuously improving features of this Facility to ensure timely financial
support to hospitals/medical centers engaged in combating COVID-19.

So far, financing of Rs. 2.2 billion for 11 hospitals/medical centers has been approved whereas financing
requests of Rs 3.6 billion for 23 hospitals/medical centers are being processed by the banks. With
today’s enhancement of financing limit, it is expected that large scale facilities will be created for
treating COVID-19 patients by using subsidized funding being extended under this Facility.

SBP takes measures to ensure continuous availability of banking services amid COVID-19

situation
SBP held a meeting with bankstoday,through video link, to assess their readiness to ensure
uninterrupted supply of banking services to clients in the wake of lockdowns and closure of
cities by Federal and Provincial Governments due to COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting was
chaired by the Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir and was attended by bank’s presidents and
senior SBP officials. The following decisions were made by SBP after consultations with the
banks.

1. Inthesedifficult times the banking industry willprovide socially responsible banking
servicesand facilitate their clients in every possible way. Banks will inform the public
using all available means of communications including advertisements in print and
social media for promotion of digital banking and cash less payments and funds
transfers.

2. Continuous availability of ATMswill be ensuredby keeping them up and running 24/7
by the banks. Banks’ call centers and helplines must also be operative 24/7 and timely
resolution of the complaints shall be ensured.

3. Recognizing the need for issuance of fit, authenticated and disinfected cash by the
banks. Detailed instructions have beenprovided by SBP to ensure to clean, disinfect,
seal and quarantine all cash being collected from hospitals and clinics and to block
circulation of such cash in the market. The banks shall report daily collection of cash
from hospitals to SBP, which shall credit bank’s accounts for the amounts so
quarantined by them.Further, arrangements are being made to provide sufficient
fresh or disinfected cash to banks enabling them to issue fresh cash or the re-issuable
cash thatremained in quarantine for at least fifteen (15) days to their clients. Banks
have been ensured that SBP has sufficient quantity of such cash, and it would meet all
demands for such cash.

4. All critical functions and systems required to provide banking services, including Real
Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) will remain available as usual even during the
lock downs. Large scale closure of branches may cause rush and congestion in the
operative branches, which may be counterproductive to efforts to contain the spread
of the disease. The banks may, however, close branches wherestaff is infected and for
which requisite human resourceis not available.The situation will be reviewed again in
couple of days based on the customers’ visit to branches during lock downs.

5. SBP,from 24'*March 2020,has invoked ascenario wherein minimal staff will be
present at its premises to undertake critical functions,whereas the rest of the staff
has been allowed to work from home. The Banks can also make such arrangements
both in their branches and Head/Regional offices. Further, the banks may start their
branch operations from 10 a.m. if needed to better facilitate their clients.

6. SBP and the banks will constantly monitor the evolving situation and shall not
hesitate to take whatever steps that may be required in the public interest.

SBP introduced new refinance scheme to avoid layoff of workers

 

To support the employment of workers in the face of economic challenges posed by the spread of
COVID-19, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has introduced a temporary refinance scheme for
businesses entitled Refinance Scheme for Payment of Wages and Salaries to the Workers and
Employees of Business Concerns. The core objective of this facility is to incentivize businesses to not
lay off their workers during COVID-19 Pandemic.

The scheme will be available to all businesses in Pakistan through banks and will cover all types of
employees including permanent, contractual, daily wages as well as outsourced workers. The scheme
will provide financing for wages and salaries expense for three months from April to June 2020 for
those businesses which do not layoff their employees for these three months.

The mark-up on the loans under this scheme will be up to 5%. Borrowers that are on the active
taxpayers list, will be able to get loans at a further reduced mark-up rate of 4%. The scheme has been
designed to give preference to smaller businesses. Businesses with a 3 month wage and salary expense
of up to Rs. 200 million will be able to avail the full amount of their expense in financing while those
with a 3 month wage and salary expense of greater than Rs. 500 million will be able to avail up to 50%
of their expense. Businesses in the middle category will be able to avail up to 75 percent of their 3
months’ salary and wage expense.

The banks will not charge any loan processing fee, credit limit fee or prepayment penalties for loans
under this scheme. A grace period of six months will be allowed to the borrowers while the repayment
of the principal amount will be made in two years. Banks will provide weekly reporting to SBP on the
take up of the scheme and in particular the reasons for any denials of financing requests under this
scheme.

SBP expects that one of the main benefits of the scheme is that employers that retain workers on their
payroll will be able to restore or increase production quickly once the situation normalizes. The scheme
will ease the liquidity constraints of the businesses and they can use their available financial resources
to meet other working capital requirements.

Interested businesses can access details of the scheme at
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C6.htm and
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C7.htm. For further clarification for any information
not available at this website, interested businesses can get further information from SBP by writing to
covid19.stimulus@sbp.org.pk or calling 021-111727273 during normal business hours.

SBP has taken a number of other measures in recent weeks to mitigate the impact of covid19 on
Pakistan’s economy including an extension in repayment of loan principal amounts by one year,
concessional financing for hospitals to procure equipment to combat covid19 as well as other
measures. A complete list of all measures is available at http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp. SBP has
been closely monitoring the credit conditions faced by the businesses and households and will take
every possible measure to perform its due role throughout this disruption phase.

Governor SBP emphasizes ongoing dialogue between the business community and policy
makers during his visit of Sialkot Chamber of Commerce & Industry

Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Dr. Reza Baqir, paid a visit today to the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (SCCI) on the invitation of its President, Mr. Qaisar Iqbal Baryal. The purpose of his visit was
to seek firsthand knowledge from the businesses community, particularly the exporters, on the economic
challenges faced by them in the face of global slowdown amid covid-19 pandemic. At the outset of his
visit, the Governor thanked the President of SCCI saying that an ongoing dialogue between the policy
makers and business community on the economic measures and their effectiveness is key to combat the
prevalent domestic as well as global economic challenges. In this regard, the Governor acknowledged the
proactive role played by SCCI in raising awareness about the issues and their potential solutions with the
policy makers. Deputy Governor, Ms. Sima Kamil, MD SBP BSC, Mr. Muhammed Ashraf Khan and other
members of the senior management were also accompanying the Governor during this visit.

Dr. Baqir’s address on the occasion encompassed many topics and answered most of the questions
prevalent amongst the business community prior to his visit. He said that the effects of COVID-19 had
taken a heavy toll on economies all over the world and Pakistan was no exception. While elaborating the
proactive steps taken by SBP since the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, as early as March 2020, the Governor
elaborated that the overall objective of these measures was to minimize the negative fallout of the
slowdown in the economy on businesses and employment in the country. Overall, the SBP measures
aimed at ensuring increased and affordable financing to the businesses to help them manage their cash
flows and financial costs effectively. In this regard, SBP reduced policy rate from 13.25 percent to 7
percent in a very short span of time that is historically unprecedented, he said.

Shedding more light on the measures to keep the wheel of economy rolling, the Governor elaborated
some other key steps taken by SBP in addition to reducing interest rates. The Governor shared the details
of Deferment of Principle Amount and Restructuring of Loans Package to facilitate the borrowers in a bid
to preserve the solvency of the borrowers and enable them to combat temporary economic disruptions.
Under this scheme, over 1.5 million borrowers benefitted with over Rs655 billion loans deferred and about
Rs200 billion restructured. Another major step by SBP to offset the sudden impact of economic shock
was to prevent layoff of workers. SBP introduced its Rozgar Scheme that aimed at preventing layoff of
workers by financing wages and salaries of all kinds of employees for private sector businesses. During
the availability of this scheme, almost 3,000 businesses availed refinancing of over Rs237 billion
benefitting over 1.6 million employees or workers.

The Governor contended that in the backdrop of COVID-19, SBP provided a number of relaxations under
Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and Long Term Finance Facility (LTFF). These included additional period of

Banks to electronically submit foreign exchange related cases through SBP Online Portal

Two core departments of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) related to forex operations i.e. Exchange Policy
Department (EPD) & Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD) have recently arranged series
of detailed presentation on foreign exchange operations and ‘SBP Online Portal’. After its formal
launch this month, banks will electronically submit foreign exchange related cases to SBP.

During the presentation, the stakeholders were given an overview about working of the online
portal.

In order to keep the clients apprised about the status of cases submitted to SBP, an email containing
system-generated unique case number will be sent to the clients on the email address provided by
banks at the time of case submission. Furthermore, the updated position of their case can also be
accessed on SBP website through unique case number assigned to each case.

Managing Director, SBP Banking Services Corporation (BSC), Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan in his
welcome address underlined the importance and key role of business sector in economic revival &
future growth of the country. He also highlighted the key initiatives taken by SBP to digitalize the
processes and move towards paperless environment, which will ultimately benefit the businesses of
the country. Director, EPD informed the participants about recent policy measures taken by SBP to
promote the business sentiments in the country. He explained that current measures are in
continuation of SBP’s efforts to ease the earlier restrictions as well as to facilitate and support ease of
doing business in view of the improved economic outlook.

It may be mentioned here that in order to create awareness among the business community about
the foreign exchange operations and to apprise them about the key developments at State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) related to digitalization and ease of doing business, awareness sessions were
conducted by SBP at Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala & Sialkot. The subject sessions were attended by
more than 150 officials from different companies nominated by various chambers and associations
including Pakistan Business Council, Overseas Chamber of Commerce & Industry and local chamber of
commerce & industry of respective cities.

The presentation was followed by interactive question and answer sessions. Participants raised
queries related to various aspects of foreign exchange operations including exchange rate stability,
SBP’s guidelines regarding trade based money laundering (TBML) and government subsidy schemes
for exporter, which were answered by the SBP management. At the conclusion of the session,
Managing Director, SBP BSC thanked the participants for their concrete and specific suggestions
which would help further improve the ‘SBP Online Portal’.

SBP extends the Rozgar Scheme for Supporting Employment for another 3 months and
widens its scope in collaboration with Government of Pakistan

Soon after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, SBP took a number of steps to provide
economic support to businesses and households. SBP reduced the financial cost to the private
and public businesses and households by reducing the policy rate by a cumulative 625 basis
points since 17° March 2020. To improve the cash flow of businesses and households, it
allowed deferment of principal amount and restructuring of loans. In addition to these
measures, SBP introduced several refinance schemes to support employment and investment
to fight the economic impact of COVID-19.

SBP has decided to extend the Rozgar scheme for another three months and, in collaboration
with the Government of Pakistan, has increased the risk coverage for SMEs under the
scheme. For details see our SBP circulars available at:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL14.htm and

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL15.htm

Specifically, following changes have been made:

1. Refinance Scheme to Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers, commonly
known as SBP Rozgar scheme: This scheme provides concessional loans to businesses for
wages and salaries expenses provided they commit not lay off their employees for the
period of the loan. SBP has decided to extend the validity of this scheme by another 3
months to end September, 2020. Businesses will now be able to obtain financing to pay
wages and salaries for a maximum period of 6 months starting April 2020 till September
2020. Effectively, this suggests that not only businesses can obtain loans to fund their
wages and salaries bill up to a period of 3 months from July till September 2020, but can
also get reimbursement for the wages and salaries paid during April-June 2020. For those
who have already availed financing under the scheme, financing limits for the months of
July to September 2020 will be calculated on the same basis on which limits were
calculated for the months of April to June 2020. Under the scheme, up till 19"" June 2020,
financing of Rs 112.8 billion have been approved by banks for 1653 businesses covering
wages and salaries of over 1.1 million employees.

2. GoP Risk Sharing Facility under SBP Rozgar Scheme: With a view to incentivize banks/DFls for
financing to SMEs and non SME corporates, Government of Pakistan (GoP) introduced a Risk
Sharing Facility (RSF) for SBP’s Rozgar Scheme. Under this facility, GoP bears 40% first loss on
disbursed portfolio (principal portion only) for eligible borrowers. Government of Pakistan has
now decided not only to extend validity of its risk sharing facility (RSF) for another three
months for SMEs and small corporates with turnover of up to Rs 2 billion but also enhanced

SBP issues guidelines for Development Finance Institutions to
undertake Shariah compliant business

 

 

To enlarge the scope of Shariah compliant financial services in the country, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
has taken another important step by issuing guidelines for Development Finance Institutions (DFls) to
undertake Shariah compliant businesses and operations. Further, keeping in view the various
developments, such as changes in the licensing and regulatory regime for banks, SBP has also updated the
guidelines, introduced in 2004, for establishing Islamic banking Institutions.

The updated guidelines deal with the establishment of a full-fledged Islamic bank, Islamic banking
subsidiary and Islamic banking branches of conventional banks. In addition, these guidelines cover
different areas including minimum capital adequacy, requirements related to sponsor directors,
business plan, Shariah governance, application fees, preconditions for commencement of
business. For details: https://www.sbp.org.pk/ibd/2020/C4.htm

 

The guidelines for conventional banks and DFls to undertake Shariah compliant business and operations
also cover the eligibility criteria for in-principle approval, proposal requirements, shariah governance,
minimum capital requirement and systems and controls. Further, separation of Islamic banking/finance
division and its different components, responsibilities of head of the Islamic banking/ finance division and
requirements for commencement of operations are part of these guidelines.

It is expected that these guidelines will facilitate the new entrants in the field of Islamic banking through
establishment of full-fledged Islamic banks, Islamic banking subsidiaries by conventional banks and the
commencement of Shariah compliant business and operations by conventional banks and DFls.

Monetary Policy Statement
March 24, 2020

1. At its last meeting on 17 March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted considerable
uncertainty about how the Coronavirus outbreak would impact the global economy and Pakistan. In the
statement issued following that meeting, the MPC “emphasized that it stood ready to take further actions if
and when needed as more information becomes available on the outlook for inflation and growth.”

2. Substantial new information on global and domestic developments has become available since the last
MPC meeting. Globally, the Coronavirus has severely increased in reach. This has caused major disruptions
to economic activity and the IMF has also significantly downgraded its global growth outlook for 2020 from
3.3 percent growth previously to below zero. These global developments have also led to a sharp fall in
international trade. On the domestic front, since the last MPC, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased
considerably, prompting social distancing and curtailment of activity. This is expected to lead to noticeable
slowdown in domestic demand.

3. The developments discussed above imply that the outlook for growth and inflation in Pakistan is likely to
be revised down further. In the wake of this new information, the MPC agreed at its emergency meeting
today, to take further action. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to cut the policy rate by a further 150 basis
points to 11 percent. This brings the cumulative easing over the past one week to 225 basis points. The MPC
was of the view that this cumulative easing would cushion the growth slowdown while protecting inflation

expectations.

4. ‘The MPC also noted that SBP is in the process of taking necessary regulatory measures in coordination
with banks to address pressures on cash flows of borrowers affected by Coronavirus related disruptions
through facilitating deferment and restructuring of their loans. The announcement of these measures is
expected soon and will complement the action being taken by the MPC on interest rates today.

5. The MPC remains ready to take whatever further actions become necessary in response to the evolving
economic impact of the Coronavirus.

Press Release on Workers’ Remittances

 

Workers’ remittances maintained their strong momentum in November, remaining above
USS 2 billion for a record 6th consecutive month.

Workers’ remittances rose to $ 2.34 billion in November, 2.4 percent higher than in October
and 28.4 percent higher than last November.

During the first five months of FY21, workers’ remittances have reached an unprecedented
level of USS 11.77 billion, 26.9 percent higher than the same period last year. On average,
workers’ remittances have been about half a billion (USS 499 million) higher in each month of
FY21 as compared to the same period last year.

Remittance inflows during the first five months of FY21 have mainly been sourced from Saudi
Arabia (S 3.3 billion), United Arab Emirates ($ 2.4 billion), United Kingdom ($ 1.6 billion) and
United States ($ 1.0 billion).

Continued government and SBP efforts to formalize remittances under the Pakistan
Remittances Initiative (PRI), rising use of digital channels amid limited cross-border travel,
orderly exchange market conditions, and some improvement in global economic activity are
some of the important factors behind the sustained improvement in workers’ remittances.

SBP conducts a review of complaints against Banks/DFIs/MFBs from 2016 to 2019

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has conducted a four year (2016-2019) review of complaints against
Banks/MFBs/DFls. The objective of the review was to gain insights on effectiveness of complaint
management at banks. The salient features of the review are being published to emphasize SBP’s
narrative that responsible complaint handling is the core element of Fair Treatment of Consumer (FTC).

This review is conducted in addition to various regulatory measures to enhance consumer grievance
handling in the industry including the issuance of detailed guidelines on complaint management at
banks and self-assessment framework.

It is pertinent to mention here that responsible banking conduct and FTC is one of the key regulatory
agendas of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). SBP recognizes that effective and efficient consumer
grievance handling mechanisms are crucial elements of FTC regime, therefore, it considers consumer
complaints as an opportunity to improve banking services and increase customer satisfaction.

The review indicates that complaints against banks during past four years have increased from 774,656
in 2016 to 1,549,837 in 2019. This increase can be attributed to improved visibility and access of
dispute resolution mechanism coupled with enhanced consumer awareness. Further, this is also due
to the fact that number and value of banking transactions have increased substantially. For instance,
the volume and value of ATM/debit card transactions have increased by 101% and 110% respectively
over the reporting period. The number of deposit accounts per ATM and per branch shows increase of
62% and 81% respectively. Similarly, during 2016 to 2019, volume and value of E-banking transactions
have substantially increased by 112% and 152% respectively on account of 71% increase in E-banking
users. Moreover, credit card related transactions increased from 18 to 39 million showing an increase
of 118% over a span of 4 years. Accordingly, the increase in complaints over the same period can be
witnessed as concentrated in ATM/Debit Card, Account maintenance, E- Banking and Credit Cards.

In terms of addressing the complaints, the resolution rate over the period 2016-2019 remained above
97% at each year's end. The average time taken for resolution of complaints remained within regulatory
turn around times. However, delays were observed in sending acknowledgments, interim and final
responses.

It may be mentioned here that banks being the first forum of redressal, have been handling 97% and
above of the total complaints of the industry while less than 3% of complaints were escalated at higher
levels including State Bank of Pakistan, Banking Mohtasib, and Pakistan Citizen Portal established by
the Prime Minister Delivery Unit.

In order to boost performance of complaint handling at banks and promote competition, SBP plans to
further enhance the related disclosures which may include publishing of bank-wise complaint handling

SBP takes measures to promote Digital Payments amid COVID-19 Pandemic

In the wake of the recent outbreak of COVID19 (Corona virus), SBP is undertaking a number of
measures to contribute towards meeting the challenges faced by society to remain safe from
this pandemic and its potential impact. Given the pivotal role of financial sector in providing
services to the general public and particularly the businesses, SBP after consultation with
stakeholders has instructed banks to take specific measures to provide their services
seamlessly taking due care of reducing the risk exposure amid corona virus.

The objective of these measures is to reduce the need for visiting bank branches or the ATMs
and to promote use of Digital Payment Services such as internet banking, mobile phone
banking etc.

SBP has instructed banks to waive all charges on fund transfers through online banking
channels such as Inter Bank Fund Transfer (IBFT) and SBP’s Real Time Gross Settlement System
for customers. Thus people can transfer money through mobile phones or internet banking
avoiding the need to visit a bank branch or an ATM without incurring any cost. They will also
not incur any cost in case of using ATMs or visiting bank branches for transferring large
amounts and can avoid the use of cash. Banks have been advised to facilitate their customers
in using online banking while taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security
of customer’s funds. Further, they will also ensure that call centres/helplines are available 24/7
for instant customer support.

Financial industry has been instructed to immediately facilitate education fee and loan
repayments through internet banking or mobile devices. Financial institutions shall also run
awareness campaigns through different channels to educate customers to use internet
banking or mobile phones, limit use of currency notes and restrict branch visits. Anticipating
any frauds in the wake of digital transactions, SBP has advised financial industry to increase
vigilance on digital channels and increase monitoring on cyber threats.

SBP expects that all these measures will help to continue meeting routine financial service
needs of bank customers. COVID19 has challenged human life globally and all the countries
are struggling to find out solutions; the key approach, so far, has been to take precautionary
measures. SBP is working with stakeholders to continuously assessing the situation and will
take every possible measure to improve the safety of public.

SBP announces new regulatory incentives to promote
low cost and affordable housing finance

 

 

State Bank of Pakistan is constantly providing enabling regulatory environment to promote housing and
construction finance. This is an important sector that has significant economic linkages with other sectors
in the economy and the current level of credit provision in this sector is at a very low level of less than 1
percent of GDP which is much lower than in other similar countries and in the region. To support the
provision of finance to this sector and especially facilitate affordable housing, SBP has now announced five
regulatory relaxations to incentivize banks for financing low cost and affordable housing. Firstly, the
definition of low cost housing finance used in the current regulations for banks has been aligned with
definition used under Government Markup Subsidy Facility for Housing Finance eligible under Tiers | & Il of
housing finance. Specifically, in the SBP regulations, the value of housing unit has been increased from Rs
3 million to Rs 3.5 million with maximum loan size increased from Rs 2.7 million to Rs 3.15 million.
Consequently, the incentive for low cost housing finance will increase for banks as they will not only be able
to enjoy markup subsidy facility by the Government but the regulatory incentives under low cost housing
finance by SBP as well.

Current regulations and banking practices require banks to obtain documentary evidence of income.
Provision of this information is difficult for people generating income from informal sources which are
generally in low income segments. In order to facilitate financing for this segment, State Bank is urging the
banks to use alternate methods to identify income sources and assess the credit worthiness of the borrower.
The 24 and 3 type of relaxations are being given to facilitate financing for this segment. Accordingly, under
2"" relaxation, banks have been exempted from the requirement of using ‘verifiable income’ for the purpose
of calculating Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) in case of low cost housing finance where banks are using income
proxies and where income of borrower is not verifiable. Resultantly, borrowers with ‘non-verifiable income,’
estimated by banks using income proxies, will also become eligible to avail low cost housing finance.

Thirdly, banks have also been exempted from the requirement of observing DBR, in case of low cost housing
finance, where banks are using repayment surrogates like rent, utility bills, telcos bills, etc. to assess
repayment capacity of borrower. Hence, borrowers without verifiable or non-verifiable income will become
eligible to avail low cost housing finance.

Fourthly, banks have been exempted from the requirement of Internal Credit Risk Rating System for the low
cost housing finance till September 30, 2022 as their current systems do not specifically cater for low cost
housing finance. Accordingly, borrowers of low cost housing finance who cannot avail financing due to banks
internal credit rating criteria will now become eligible if the bank is otherwise satisfied. This time barred
relaxation will provide banks to develop their Internal Credit Risk Rating Systems for low cost housing
finance.

Finally, in order to provide comfort to the borrowers who have liquid securities or already have a housing
unit, banks have been allowed to extend housing finance for purchase/construction of a residential property
by accepting existing residential property or liquid securities in lieu of equity contribution for housing
finance at the time of calculations of Loan to Value ratio. Financing bank will create its lien on existing
residential property/liquid securities in addition to mortgage of residential property being financed.

National Financial Literacy Program milestones achieved: SBP

The National Financial Literacy Program (NFLP) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) completed
its third year at the end of FY20 with all the targets surpassing for the fiscal year, despite the
outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020.

In order to address the challenge of financial exclusion, the Government of Pakistan adopted
a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) in 2015. The NFIS aims to enhance formal
financial access to 50 percent of the adult population by 2020. Accordingly, with the core
objective to enhance access to finance in the country and encourage usage of formal banking
channels, the State Bank of Pakistan took the lead in implementing the measures suggested
vide the NFIS and incorporated the same in its Strategic Vision 2020. Among other measures,
one major initiative was the launch of NFLP.

NFLP is SBP’s flagship program that is focused on imparting basic financial education to
unbanked/underserved segments of population especially the women and youth. Keeping in
view the diversity and literacy level of target audience, the NFLP program has been segmented
into two components, National Financial Literacy Program for Adults (NFLP-A) and the National
Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y). The objectives of this program are to i) Provide
financial education to around 2.6 million beneficiaries over five years, 1 million through NFLP-
A and 1.6 million through NFLP-Y; ii) have gender mix of 50:50; and iii) to open bank or mobile
accounts of the beneficiaries.

Under NFLP-A, despite the prevailing pandemic of COVID 19, 250,000 participants were given
financial education during FY20 against the target of 226,000 beneficiaries, through almost
10,000 classroom sessions and 300 street theatre programs. This comprised of 70%
participants located in rural area with significant improvement in female participation (42% in
FY19 to 57% in FY20). The number of participants who opened a bank or mobile account at the
end of the session, also showed remarkable improvement from 53% in FY19 to 83% in FY20.
Since the initiation of NFLP-A in August 2017, more than 600,000 adults have been imparted
financial education.

Under NFLP-Y, since its inception in Oct 2018, around 300,000 students have been trained
against a target of 240,000 students by end March 2020. This program envisages to impart
financial education to three age groups 9-12 years, 13-17 years and 18-29 years across 45
selected districts of Pakistan.

In addition to the above and to supplement the message of financial literacy, various other
initiatives have been taken under NFLP which include: i) country-wide media campaigns to
sensitize the masses about the program; ii) setting up of a dedicated toll-free helpline for
public queries; iii) launch of dedicated website (financialeducation.pk) to provide information
on basic financial concepts, program schedule and other routine updates; iv) MoUs signed

Monetary Policy Statement
May 15, 2020

1. At its meeting on 15 May 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy
rate by 100 basis points to 8 percent. This decision reflected the MPC’s view that the inflation outlook has
improved further in light of the recent cut in domestic fuel prices. As a result, inflation could fall closer to the
lower end of the previously announced ranges of 11-12 percent this fiscal year and 7-9 percent next fiscal

year.

2. ‘The MPC highlighted that the coronavirus pandemic has created unique challenges for monetary policy
due to its non-economic origin and the temporary disruption of economic activity required to combat it.
While easier monetary policy can neither affect the rate of infection transmission nor prevent the near-term
fall in economic activity due to lockdowns, it can provide liquidity support to households and businesses to
help them through the ensuing temporary phase of economic disruption. In particular, the successive policy
rate cuts and sizeable cheap loans provided through the SBP’s enhanced refinancing facilities have helped
maintain credit flows, bolster the cash flow of borrowers, and support asset prices. This has contained the
tightening of financial conditions that would otherwise have amplified the initial necessary contraction in
activity.

3. The MPC noted the swift and forceful monetary easing of 525 basis point in the two months since the
beginning of the crisis and SBP’s measures to extend principal repayments, provide payroll financing, and
other measures to support liquidity. Together with the government’s proactive fiscal stimulus—including
targeted support packages for low-income households, SMEs, and construction—as well as assistance from
the international community, these actions should provide ample cushion to growth and employment, while
also maintaining financial stability. This coordinated and broad-based policy response has provided relief and
stability and should provide support for recovery as the pandemic subsides.

4. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Key developments since the last MPC meeting

5. The MPC noted three key developments since the last MPC meeting on 16"" April, 2020. First, the
government has significantly reduced petrol and diesel prices by 30-40 percent in response to the continued
fall in global oil prices, which has improved the outlook for inflation. Second, most countries, including
Pakistan, have begun easing lockdowns, which should help provide support to economic activity.
Nevertheless, as elsewhere, the situation remains highly uncertain. A possible rise in infections could prompt
fresh lockdowns, and the recovery could prove more sluggish than is currently being anticipated. Third, due
to timely policy actions and international assistance, the initial volatility observed in domestic financial and
foreign exchange markets has somewhat subsided in recent weeks, although global financial conditions
remain considerably tighter than before the coronavirus outbreak. Recent supportive developments have
helped to restore the SBP’s foreign reserves position to close to pre-coronavirus levels of over US$ 12 billion.

Record high workers’ remittances received in June 2020

Workers’ remittances rose by a significant 50.7% during June 2020 to reach record high USD
2,466.2 million compared with USD 1,636.4 million in June 2019. Similarly, on a cumulative
basis, workers’ remittances increased to a historic high level of USD 23,120.7 million during
FY20, witnessing a growth of 6.4% over USD 21,739.4 million during FY19. It would also be
pertinent to mention here that inflow of workers’ remittances registered an increase of a 7.8%
during March-June 2020 pandemic period compared with the corresponding period of 2019.

During June 2020, larger amounts of Workers' Remittances are received from Saudi Arabia (US $ 619.4
million), USA (US $ 452.0 million), UAE (US $ 431.7 million) and UK (US $ 401.0 million) recording an
increase of 42.0 percent, 7.1 percent, 33.5 percent and 40.8 percent respectively as compared to May,
2020.

The significant increase in remittances during June 2020 can be attributed to a number of
factors. Since many of the countries eased lockdown in June, overseas Pakistanis were able to
transfer accumulative funds, which they were unable to send earlier. Further, it is also
believed that they sent remittances to support extended families and friends due to COVID-
19,

In addition to these, efforts by the Government and SBP also played their role in the increased
inflow of workers’ remittances during FY20 in general and Covid-19 period, March till June
2020, in particular. Supportive government policies in terms of extension of Reimbursement
of TT Charges Scheme (Free Send Remittance Scheme) to small remitters by reducing threshold
from USD 200 to USD 100, as well as, broadening the scope of incentive scheme for marketing
scheme for financial institutions increased the incentives for sending remittances through
regular channels. Further, on-boarding of a large number of technology based money transfer
companies by SBP and PRI also helped absorb the shock of lockdowns. Financial institutions
were motivated to use effective marketing campaigns with particular focus on digital channels
for sending and receiving remittances to promote the use of legal channels.

Monetary Policy Statement
September 21, 2020

1. At its meeting on 21% September 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the
policy rate unchanged at 7 percent. The MPC noted that compared to the time of the last meeting in June
2020, business confidence and the outlook for growth have improved. This reflects the decline in Covid-19
cases in Pakistan and the easing of lockdowns, as well as the timely stimulus provided by the Government
and SBP. At the same time, the forecast for inflation has risen slightly, primarily due to recent supply side
shocks to food prices. Average inflation is now expected to fall within the previously announced range of 7 —
9 percent during FY21, rather than marginally below.

2. ‘The MPC noted that financial conditions continue to be accommodative with real interest rates
remaining slightly below zero on a forward-looking basis. In addition, the series of targeted measures
undertaken by SBP since the Covid-19 outbreak have injected significant liquidity and further lowered
funding costs for many businesses and households. Together, these monetary measures have injected an
estimated stimulus of Rs. 1.58 trillion, or about 3.8 percent of GDP, in the cash flow of businesses and
households. In addition, the government has undertaken a number of significant measures to support
economic activity including the Ehsaas emergency cash program, commodity financing, a risk-sharing facility
for SMEs, and acceleration of tax refunds.

3. ‘Taking into account the changes in the outlook for inflation and growth since the last MPC and the
impact of the stimulus measures undertaken by the Government and SBP, the MPC was of the view that the
stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to provide needed support to the emerging recovery, while
keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability.

4, In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Real sector

5. Following a deep contraction between March and June, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) index
returned to expansion in July, growing at 5 percent (y/y). High-frequency demand indicators including auto
sales, cement dispatches, POL sales, and electricity consumption also reflect an encouraging pick-up in
economic activity. Nonetheless, the economic recovery remains uneven across industries, with the hospitality
and certain services sectors especially lagging, and the level of activity generally still remains below pre-
Corona levels. Going forward, growth is projected to recover to slightly above 2 percent in FY21, after falling
to -0.4 percent last year. The recovery is expected to be driven mainly by manufacturing-related activities and
construction, which are being supported by various financial policies from SBP including the Temporary
Economic Refinance Facility (https://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL20.htm) and the

 

government’s incentives for the housing and construction sectors. The growth outlook is subject to
uncertainty. On the downside, risks include a potential second wave of Covid-19 domestic infections, a
possible sharp increase in infections in the winter months in Pakistan’s major export markets in Europe and
the US, and the threat to agriculture from locust attacks. On the upside, a faster global recovery could lift
exports higher.

Frequently Asked Questions in respect of Foreign Currency Accounts Rules

Please also see the SBP press release on the SRO by Ministry of Finance available at:
https://www.sbp.org.pk/press/2020/Pr-11-Oct-20.pdf

Question 1. Why there was a need to issue SRO by Ministry of Finance, if there is no change in existing
foreign exchange regulations?

Ans. Protection of Economic Reforms Act 1992 (PERA) was amended in 2018. The amendments made
in PERA included, inter alia, that federal government may make rules governing deposits into and
withdrawals from the foreign currency accounts. The purpose for issuance of these rules is to
provide enabling provisions for SBP to issue instructions related to deposits in FCY accounts,
including those already in place as well as any that may be issued in future.

In this way, these rules aim to provide a framework for the operation of individual foreign currency
accounts. In addition, the rules also formalize the mandate given to SBP to strengthen the foreign
exchange regime and to make it easier for the individuals to meet their foreign currency needs
through banking channels.

Question 2. Would SBP issue any guidelines for FCY accounts in accordance with the rules to clarify
the situation?

Ans. There is no change in State Bank’s existing regulations regarding FCY accounts and these
regulations do not conflict with the rules issued by Ministry of Finance.

Question 3. Do the rules have any impact on the newly introduced Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) for
Non-Resident Pakistanis?

Ans. No, RDA is a distinct scheme for Non Resident Pakistanis, offering both FCY and PKR accounts.
Funds can be received into these accounts from abroad but they cannot be fed from within Pakistan.
Proceeds of investments, profit thereon and any balances in these accounts are freely repatriable
without any approval oor hindrance. For more details, please refer to:

State Bank enhances scope and financing limits under its Rozgar Scheme

Since its launch of Refinance Scheme to Support Employment and Prevent Layoff of Workers, called
Rozgar Scheme in common parlance, State Bank has been constantly receiving feedback from various
stakeholders, making the scheme more facilitative for businesses and creating incentives to prevent
layoff of employees under current COVID Pandemic scenario. Many of the changes in the scheme were
carried out to ensure that the benefits of the scheme particularly reaches to the SMEs that offer
employment to a large number of people. In this regard, recently announced Government's risk sharing
facility and allowing corporate guarantees as collateral are expected to incentivize banks in extending
loans to collateral deficient SMEs. Now taking another step further to facilitate middle and large
businesses, which employ large numbers of people, to ensure payment of wages and salaries under
this scheme, SBP has decided to enhance its refinance limits announced earlier.

Hence, State Bank will now finance up to 100% of wages and salaries of businesses with average 3-
month wage bill of up to Rs500 million (see table below). This can be used for the onward payment of
wages and salaries for the months of April, May and June, 2020. Earlier, 100% financing was available
up to a wage bill of Rs200 million only. Similarly, for businesses with 3-month wage bill exceeding
Rs500 million, State Bank will now finance of up to 75% with maximum financing of Rs1 billion. Earlier,
75% financing was available up to a maximum of Rs375 million and 50% up to a maximum of Rs500
million. The above changes are applicable with immediate effect. However, businesses that had earlier
availed lower financing due to applicable limits can now avail additional financing on the basis of
revised criteria. Further details on this measure are available in the SBP circular available at:
http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL10.htm

A comparison of previous and new financing limits is given in the following table:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Category | Wages and Salaries Bill for Previous Loan Limit New Loan Limits
3 months
(1) (2) (3) (4)
A Less than or equal to Rs. | 100% of 3 months wage bill | 100% of 3 months
200 million wage bill
B More than Rs. 200 million | Rs. 200 million or 75% of 3 | 100% of 3 months
and less than or equal to | months wage bill, whichever | wage bill
Rs.500 million is higher subject to a
maximum cap of Rs 375
million
Cc More than Rs.500 million Rs. 375 million or 50% of 3 | Rs.500 million or 75%
months wage bill, whichever | of 3 months wage bill,
is higher subject to maximum | whichever is higher
cap of Rs. 500 million subject to maximum
cap of Rs. 1 billion

 

 

 

 

 

This increase in financing limits along with Government's risk sharing facility for collateral deficient
SMEs and small corporates will enable the full array of businesses to benefit from SBP’s Rozgar Scheme

SBP calls meeting of Chambers of Commerce to seek input
on Automation of Tax Refunds Project

Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dr. Reza Baqir held an online meeting with the business
community today to seek feedback on an ongoing project of automation of payment of tax
refunds by SBP. The meeting was attended by the office bearers of Pakistan Business Council
(PBC), Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FPCCI) and Chambers of
Commerce and Industries of various cities.

Governor SBP in his opening remarks introduced SBP’s Automation of Payment of Tax Refunds
Project saying that after automation of government’s revenue collections, efforts are
underway by SBP to automate the government’s payments to ensure transparency, efficiency
and public convenience. He said that improving ease of doing business is one of the shared
goals of the government and SBP for its significant potential impact on boosting economic
activity in the country. Governor Baqir remarked that Automation of payment of Tax Refunds
Project is a part of SBP efforts in this direction in collaboration with FBR and Pakistan Customs.
Adding further, he said that since the project is ultimately going to benefit the businesses, it is
important that the system is developed in consultation with all the stakeholders including the
businesses. He emphasized that, in this regard, feedback of businesses is very important since
they are the key stakeholders.

A senior SBP official gave a detailed presentation on the project elaborating that the project
constituted two broader components, automation of payment of duty drawback claims and
the automation of payment of sales tax refunds. After highlighting the issues in the existing
mechanisms he explained that how the automation will simplify the processes and bring
efficiency in terms of time saving and human resources. He highlighted that there will be
minimal human intervention in processing and payment of refund claims as the system
generated payment messages will be sent to SBP on real time basis through an interface
between FBR/Pakistan Customs and SBP for crediting the funds in the claimants’ account.

The representatives of Chambers of Commerce appreciated the initiative of SBP and provided
valuable feedback. They also assured their cooperation to SBP in the development of this
project of national importance.

SBP and ROZEE.PK join hands to impart free of cost financial literacy
education

National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y), a project of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP),
and Rozee.pk have partnered to impart free of cost financial literacy education to Pakistan’s youth
through an engaging and interactive game called ‘PomPak — Learn to Earn’.

PomPak delivers its lessons in English and Urdu language through a story-based game format
designed to help understand and apply principles of financial literacy. Users follow the story of two
entrepreneurial families as they tackle personal, financial, and business decisions. As the player of
this game, the aim is to help the families create a successful business. In just a couple of hours, users
can master the essentials of saving, budgeting, borrowing, and banking, among many other topics.
The game targets three age-groups — Children (9-12), Adolescents’ (13-17), and Youth (18-29) and can
be accessed through a person’s desktop browser or through a dedicated mobile phone application.
The game can be played on any Android or IOS based smart phone.

During such an unprecedented time amid COVID-19, when businesses, schools, and other public
venues are closed around the country and remote learning has increased significantly, the youth of
Pakistan may take advantage of their free time and gain the much needed financial literacy training
through this game which will help them to understand financial matters.

Anyone who completes the course would be awarded with a Certificate of Financial Literacy. This
digital certificate is jointly issued by the National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), a
subsidiary of the SBP and National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLP-Y).

National Financial Literacy Program for Youth (NFLPY) aims to impart essential financial education to
Pakistani youth and school going children for strengthening their money management skills and
understanding of the financial matters. NFLP-Y is expected to serve as a medium to connect youth
with financial institutions that offer banking products and services.

State Bank to Further Facilitate Freelancers

In order to broaden the scope of business-to-customer transactions through home
remittance channel, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has enhanced payment limits against
freelance services in computer and information systems and other freelance services from
USS 5,000 per individual per month to USS 25,000 per individual per month.

The enhancement in limit will facilitate freelancers to route greater value of funds through
a more economical and efficient channel of home remittances and help in receiving foreign
exchange flows through formal banking channels in the country.

This would also enable freelancers to expand their business/ operations and engage new
freelancers to join the workforce. This is expected to create employment opportunities and
increase foreign exchange earnings of the country.

While Export of Services has been growing in double digits, (10.5% rise registered in January,
2020), this enhancement of limits for freelancers shall further accelerate growth in Export
of Services in the months ahead.

Tax regime for non-residents simplified to encourage
investment in long-term debt securities

Amendments in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 have been issued to simplify the tax regime for non-
resident companies investing in debt instruments and Government securities. These amendments
aim to deepen our capital markets, support availability of long term rupee financing sources, support
competition in the local currency debt market, and diversify the source of funding for the
government.

The existing foreign exchange framework allows non-residents to invest in debt instruments and
Government securities through Special Convertible Rupee Account (SCRA) maintained with banks in
Pakistan. However, the tax structure for non-residents investing in debt securities was historically
complex. Different rates applicable for the withholding tax on profit on debt and capital gains tax,
penal transaction charges for non-filers, a complex tax-filing process and uncertainty about tax
applicability were the key impediments to foreign investment into the local debt market, particularly
in the long-term debt instruments. In this context, the recent amendment in the tax laws has
simplified Pakistan’s tax regime for investment in the local debt market.

Specifically, the above Ordinance has implemented the following changes in Income Tax Ordinance,
2001 to simplify the tax regime for non-resident companies, having no permanent establishment in
Pakistan, investing through SCRA in debt instruments and government securities (including Treasury
Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds):

1. The capital gains tax shall be subject to withholding at the rate of ten percent and shall constitute
final discharge of the tax liability;

2. No deduction of 0.6% banking transaction tax under section 236P on transactions in SCRA;
3. No advance tax payment under section 147 on capital gains;

4. Dispensation from the requirement of registration under section 181, filing of return under
section 114 and filing of statement of final taxation under section 115 in respect of income solely
from capital gains or profit on debt from investment in debt securities;

5. No distinction shall be made in terms of filer or non-filer;

Many non-resident investors currently benefit from tax treaties and already enjoy reduced rates of
taxation around 10 percent. The key provision in the ordinance is to simplify the tax structure and
process for international investors.

The above amendments will help to deepen the capital market, generate greater interest in the
longer-dated government securities, diversify the investor base, and reduce the cost of debt for the
government.

Strong Growth in Digital Financial Transactions in the country in Q1 FY2020/21
Key Highlights

e During Q1-FY21, the number of registered mobile phone banking users reached 8.9 million
showing an increase of 41% over Q1-FY20 and the number of internet users of bank websites
reached 4.3 million with a growth of 26% over the same period

e Mobile banking transactions increased to 36.4 million amounting to Rs. 908.7 billion, marking
an increase of 139% by volume and 211% by value when compared with the same period last
year

e Internet banking transactions increased to 18.9 million, valuing Rs. 1.1 trillion during Q1-FY21,
registering a growth of 55% in volume and 89% in value, in comparison to the same period last
year

The State Bank of Pakistan released its Quarterly Payment System Review (QPSR) for the first quarter,
July — September 2020, of the fiscal year 2020-21 today, which shows strong growth in the pace of
digital financial transactions in the country.

Promoting digital financial services is a key goal of the SBP. According to the data reported in the
review, digital payment transactions in Pakistan have increased significantly during Q1-FY21, largely
due to the impact of measures taken by SBP creating incentives for customers. Growth in digital
payment infrastructure as well as emergence of new payment aggregators have also been a
contributing factor in this growth. Moreover, it also reflects the changes in consumer’s preference for
digital transactions amid Covid19 situation.

According to the Q1-FY21 QPSR, 253.7 million e-Banking transactions were conducted by customers
valuing Rs. 19 trillion. E-banking transactions comprise Real-Time Online Branches (RTOBs)
Transactions, ATM Transactions, Internet Banking Transactions, Mobile Phone Banking Transactions, e-
commerce, POS, and Call Center/ IVR Banking. Although, RTOB transactions have a major share of e-
banking transactions in terms of value, about 80%, other types of transactions are more than 83% of
the e-banking transactions in terms of volume. During Q1-FY21, the most promising uptake was seen
in internet banking and mobile banking transactions as the number of registered mobile phone banking
users reached 8.9 million showing an increase of 41% over Q1-FY20 and the number of internet users
touched 4.3 million with a growth of 26% over the same period. Accordingly, the mobile banking
transactions increased to 36.4 million amounting to Rs. 908.7 billion, marking an increase of 139% by
volume and 211% by value when compared with the same period last year. Similarly, internet banking
transactions increased to 18.9 million, valuing Rs. 1.1 trillion during Q1-FY21, registering a growth of
55% in volume and 89% in value, in comparison to the same period last year.

Another major avenue of e-banking transactions is through Point of Sale (POS), whereby people make
transactions using credit or debit cards typically for shopping at markets. The number of transactions
through POS machines that declined sharply during Q3 and Q4 of FY20, owing to the closure of markets
amid Covid19, recovered significantly in Q1-FY21. The number of transactions through POS were
recorded at 16.8 million amounting to Rs. 92.3 billion, showing an increase of 47% in terms of volume
and 49% in value during Q1-FY21 over Q4-FY20. In addition to POS based transactions, card based

State Bank of Pakistan Designates Domestic Systemically Important Banks

 

The State Bank of Pakistan has today announced the designation of Domestic Systemically
Important Banks (D-SIBs) for the year 2020 under the Framework for Domestic Systemically
Important Banks that was introduced in April 2018.

The framework introduced by State Bank is consistent with the international standards and
practices and takes into account the local dynamics. It specifies the methodology for the
identification and designation of D-SIBs, enhanced regulatory and supervisory requirements, and
implementation guidelines. These enhanced requirements aim to further strengthen the
resilience of the Systemically Important banks against shocks and augment their risk management
capacities.

The identification of D-SIBs involves two-step process. In the first step, sample banks are
identified each year based on the quantitative and qualitative criteria. In the second step, D-SIBs
are designated from among the sample banks on the basis of institutions’ systemic score in terms
of their size, interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity.

In line with D-SIBs Framework, State Bank has carried out the annual assessment on the basis of
financials of end December 2019. As per this assessment, three banks viz. Habib Bank Ltd.,
National Bank of Pakistan, and United Bank Ltd. have been designated as D-SIBs for the year 2019.
These banks will continue to follow enhanced supervisory requirements as well as the following
additional common equity tier-1 capital (CET-1) requirements:

Besides, branches of Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) operating in Pakistan will
hold additional CET1 capital against their risk-weighted assets in Pakistan at the rate as
applicable on the respective principal G-SIB.

SBP implements Regulatory Approval System for ease of doing business

SBP has launched a Regulatory Approval System (RAS) for submission of cases related to foreign
exchange policy and operations dealt by its Exchange Policy Department (EPD), SBP and Foreign
Exchange Operations Department (FEOD), SBP-BSC respectively. SBP RAS, which has become
operational from March 24"", 2020, provides an online platform to banks to interact with the SBP/SBP-
BSC for submission of cases and receiving regulatory decisions.

Bringing ease of doing business, a key feature of the system is to keep the business customers updated
about the status of their requests routed through banks from the day it is received at SBP. Customers
will receive system-generated update status reports, at their email address provided by bank, from the
time of case submission till completion. Customers will also be able to check out the updated status of
their cases on SBP’s website anytime.

Using SBP RAS, banks will electronically submit foreign exchange operations related cases to the
Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD). The paper based submission of cases by Authorized
Dealers to FEOD has been abolished forthwith. Similarly, foreign exchange policy related cases
pertaining to Exchange Policy Department (EPD) will also be submitted electronically through SBP RAS.
However, for EPD, in addition to electronic submission, manual submission of cases through surface
mail will continue, for the time being, till further instructions.

SBP RAS is expected to conserve resources and bring efficiency by allowing timely FX-regulatory
approvals and replacing the paper based submissions that are prone to logistic and storage issues and
unnecessary delays. SBP RAS is a step towards digitalization intended to leverage technology for
improving public service and promoting ease of doing business in the country. The initiative is a part of
SBP’s Vision 2020 under which a Knowledge Management Project was initiated aiming to implement a
modern framework for the retention and sharing of information and knowledge.

Clarification on Foreign Currency Accounts Rules 2020

On 6th October 2020, the Federal Government issued Foreign Currency Accounts Rules, 2020 under
the provisions of Protection of Economic Reforms Act, 1992. There has been no change in the general

be fed by remittances received from abroad, travelers’ cheques issued outside Pakistan and
encashment of securities issued by Govt. of Pakistan. A foreign currency account of a citizen of Pakistan
resident in Pakistan can also be fed with cash foreign currency only if the account holder is a filer as

State Bank Announces Measures to Facilitate Export—Oriented Sectors and
Manufacturing Concerns

In an effort to further facilitate the exporters as well as the manufacturing sectors, SBP has allowed
exporters to directly dispatch the shipping documents of their exports’ consignment to their foreign
buyers without any limit, subject to condition that the exporter’s export over-dues are less than one
percent and the exporter has exports of at least USD 5 million during the previous three years. Earlier,
exporters could dispatch the shipping documents directly to their foreign buyers for export
consignments of up to USD 100,000/, or equivalent in other currencies. This limit was in place since
2017.

Moreover, SBP has enhanced the existing limit of USD 10,000/, or equivalent in other currencies, per
invoice allowed to banks to make advance payment on behalf of manufacturing & industrial concerns
and commercial importers for import of raw material, spare parts and machinery, to USD 25,000/.

These measures are in continuation of facilitating export-oriented industries and manufacturing
concerns in the backdrop of ease of doing business and promoting exports’ growth and will further
contribute in improving economic outlook of the country.

It is pertinent to mention here that in January 2020, SBP had taken certain measures to facilitate export-
oriented industries and manufacturing concerns. These included:

1. Extending the facility to make advance payment up to USD 10,000/, or equivalent in other
currencies, per invoice, for import of raw material, spare parts and machinery to commercial
importers as well in addition to manufacturing & industrial concerns, allowed earlier.

2. Allowing Authorized Dealers to effect import advance payment against irrevocable letter of
credit, up to 100% of the value of letter of credit, for import of plant, machinery, spare parts
and raw material etc. on behalf of manufacturing concerns for their own use only.

3. Extending the facility allowed to manufacturing & industrial concerns for import of raw
materials and spare parts on open account basis to commercial importers as well.

SBP Eases Cash Margin Restriction on Imports

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has eased 100 percent cash margin requirement on the import of
certain raw materials to support manufacturing and industrial sectors and further enhance their
capacity to contribute towards the recovery of the economy in post COVID-19 era.

The cash margin condition was initially imposed in 2017 on 404 HS Codes and later in 2018 ona further
131 items, with a view to contain the import of mostly consumer goods and to allow room for the
import of more growth-inducing items.

Considering the challenges posed by the COVID-19 to the manufacturing sector and other economic
segments, and on the representations made by various businesses and associations, the SBP re-
evaluated the cash margin requirements and decided to remove this requirement on 106 items/HS
Codes. For details: https://www.sbp.org.pk/bprd/2020/CL43.htm

The removal of the cash margin requirements on these items will support businesses’ cash flows and
liquidity, by freeing up funds previously held with the banks under cash margin against imports, and
route these funds towards avenues of growth and development that will benefit the economy.

The SBP remains committed to facilitate industries and businesses in contributing to the growth and
development of the country, and is ready to take any further actions required to support the overall
manufacturing and industrial activity.

SBP provides further incentives for businesses to retain workers & employees and prevent layoffs

On April 10, 2020 the State Bank of Pakistan announced an incentive scheme— entitled Refinance
Scheme for Payment of Wages and Salaries to the Workers and Employees of Business Concerns —that
enables the provision of concessional credit for payroll finance to businesses that commit to not lay off
workers for the next three months. Today the SBP has introduced further incentives under this scheme
to support employment and avoid layoffs in the country. These additional incentives include relaxations
in collateral requirements, further reduction in end-user rate, reimbursement of wages, special
accounts for employees to receive wages, borrowing from banks other than maintaining payrolls,
simplification of application form for SMEs and bank’s exposure limits. These additional incentives are
effective as of today. Further information on these incentives is provided below and further details are

available at the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/corona.asp

Based on feedback from stakeholders, SMEs including vendors and distributors were particularly facing
the problem of providing security/collateral. To address this issue, SBP has now allowed banks for
providing financing against corporate guarantees of companies in value / supply chain relationship with
the borrowers. Moreover, banks have also been encouraged to provide loans without any collateral i.e.
taking clean exposure of up to Rs 5 million.

SBP has enhanced the incentive to business which are active tax payers by reducing the mark up rate
for them to 3% that was set as 4% earlier. Now the SBP will provide refinance to banks at 0%. This also
increases the gap between the rates charged to active tax payer and the non-tax payers businesses, as
the latter can be charged an end user markup rate of up to 5%.

To facilitate employees for receiving wages under the scheme directly, banks have been allowed to
open their accounts on the information and documents provided by the employers along with an
undertaking stating that these persons are bonafide employees/workers. Banks will ensure verification
of the employees using NADRA Verisys before activation of such accounts. These accounts, however,
could be used solely for salary disbursement and withdrawal purposes only.

Businesses have also been given flexibility to avail loan under SBPs refinance scheme for wages from
any bank and they will not be limited to avail loans from the bank that manages their payroll. Further,
businesses will also be able to get reimbursement of salaries pertaining to the month of April 2020 that
have been disbursed through own sources, provided they have applied for financing under the scheme
before disbursement and the same is subsequently approved by the banks. SMEs can apply for the
financing on a simplified loan application form prescribed by SBP for this scheme.

To facilitate the banks further for lending under the scheme, Banks’ exposure under the scheme has
been exempted from the per-party or the per-group exposure limits. It will enable them to lend to
borrowers that have exhausted their exposure limits.

All these benefits will also be available to businesses availing financing under the scheme from Islamic
Banking Institutions.

SBP reduces markup rate to 5 percent on refinance schemes for investment and introduces
other enhancements

Taking cognizance of the negative fallout of COVID-19 Pandemic for the economy, State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) has been constantly taking steps to safeguard the businesses and households and a
reduction in the policy rate has been a key step since March 2020. SBP has reduced the policy rate by
625 basis points since 17"" March, 2020 to 7 percent. To extend the benefits of this reduction in the
policy rate to the users of its refinance schemes, SBP has now decided to align the end user markup
rates on two of its refinance schemes for promoting investment in the country. Specifically, SBP has
curtailed the end user markup rates on Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) to 5% from the
existing 7% and on Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) for non-textile sector to 5% from 6%. Details:

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL19.htm

http://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/CL20.htm

Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF): SBP introduced this facility to provide stimulus to
the economy by supporting new investment and balancing, modernization and restructuring (BMR) of
the existing projects. To further improve the incentive under the scheme, SBP has lowered the end user
mark-up rates from existing 7% to 5%. SBP will now be providing refinance to banks at 1% with banks’
maximum margin of 4%. Further, SBP has also allowed the TERF facility in cases where LCs/Inland LCs
were opened prior, but retiring after the introduction of the scheme on March 17, 220. These
measures, in the backdrop of earlier policy action of allowing BMR under TERF, are expected to further
support the economic activity, new long term investment and employment generation. Under this
scheme, up till 2""¢ July 2020, Rs10.5 billion have been approved by banks for 21 projects.

Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF): LTFF is one of the oldest refinance schemes of SBP under which
financing is available for export-oriented projects for purchase of imported and locally manufactured
new plant and machinery. In March, 2020 SBP opened the LTFF to all sectors across the board. Earlier
the end user markup rate under this scheme were 5% for textile sector and 6% for non-textile sectors.
State Bank has now reduced its refinance rate for non-textile sector by 1% and therefore the end user
rate for all sectors across the board will be 5%.

It is expected that the above measures will help facilitate long term investment in both domestic and
export market.

phone calls to individuals, impersonating as officials of SBP or other agencies, seeking personal
information regarding their deposit accounts on the pretext that SBP is collecting information from
banking customers in light of emergency declared in the country due to COVID-19. In some instances,
the fraudsters also claim that the information is required to ensure smooth functioning of their
accounts in case ATM services become unavailable.

State Bank of Pakistan never seeks details of account holders of any bank and all such calls made on its

provide any information.

Please report such calls to your bank immediately. In addition, these call can also be reported to SBP

Banks disbursed Rs 1,215 billion during FY 2019-20 to
agriculture sector amid COVID-19 pandemic

Banks disbursed Rs 1,215 billion to agriculture sector during FY 2019-20. This is 3.5 percent higher than
the amount disbursed in the previous fiscal year but less than the credit target of Rs 1,350 billion which
was Set by Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) in Peshawar in November 2019. Some factors
which have constrained the growth of agriculture credit include the impact of COVID-19 pandemic,
locust attack and continuing real side issues including water shortage, low production of cotton,
sugarcane, low off take of fertilizers and volatility in prices of agri. produce etc. The outstanding
portfolio of agriculture credit increased to Rs 581 billion at end June, 2020, registering growth of 3.3%
compared with the last year’s position of Rs 562 billion. However, the number of agriculture borrowers
declined from 4.01 million at end June 2019 to 3.74 million at end June 2020 due to the COVID-19
lockdown situation in the country.

The analysis of disbursement reveals that during FY 2019-20, five major commercial banks collectively
disbursed agriculture loans of Rs 708.3 billion or 100.5% of their annual target of Rs 705 billion,
specialized banks disbursed Rs 71.1 billion or 62.9% of their annual target of Rs 113 billion and fourteen
domestic private banks as a group achieved 88.7% by disbursing Rs 225.0 billion against their target of
Rs 253.6 billion. Further, the five Islamic Banks as a group achieved 76.6% of their annual target of Rs
55.0 billion by disbursing Rs 42.1 billion which is 6.1 % higher than the disbursement made during the
corresponding period last year. Similarly, the Islamic windows of commercial banks disbursed Rs 43.5
billion or 79.2% against the target of Rs 55.0 billion in FY 2019-20 which is 33 % higher from the
disbursement of Rs 32.7 billion made during last year.

The agriculture credit of microfinance sector remained relatively sluggish due to COVID-19 lockdown
in the 2nd half of FY 2019-20. The Microfinance Banks (MFBs) as a group have achieved 75.7% by
disbursing agriculture loans of Rs 139.3 billion to small farmers which is 9.5% lower than the
disbursement of Rs 154 billion during same period last year. Likewise, the Microfinance
Institutions/Rural Support Programs collectively achieved 73.4% of their targets by disbursing Rs 28.9
billion which is 15 % lower than the disbursement of Rs 34 billion made during the last year to small
and marginalized farmers.

It is important to mention that SBP announced a comprehensive relief package in collaboration with
stakeholders for relief of agriculture sector to deal with the adverse implications of the ongoing
pandemic on the farming community and agriculture business in the downstream of value chains.
These measures which included deferment of principal and restructuring/rescheduling of agriculture
loans were initially allowed uptill June 30, 2020 have been extended upto 30 September 2020. SBP will
continue to monitor the situation and it may introduce more measures to help the sector manage its

finances during this temporary phase of disruption.

Workers’ Remittances Maintain Strong Momentum in December 2020

¢ Workers’ remittances maintained their strong momentum for the seventh consecutive month in
December. Remittances rose further to $2.4 billion, growing by 16.2 percent on a year-on-year basis
and 4.2 percent on a month-on-month basis.

© On a cumulative basis, workers’ remittances reached an unprecedented level of $14.2 billion during
the first half of FY21, 24.9 percent higher than the same period last year. This is the highest half yearly
growth since FY07.

¢ Remittance inflows have been well-diversified. Most of the inflows during H1-FY21 were sourced from
Saudi Arabia ($4.0 billion), United Arab Emirates ($3.0 billion), United Kingdom ($1.9 billion) and United
States ($1.2 billion).

¢ This strong growth in workers’ remittances is attributable to the increased use of formal channels on
the back of sustained efforts by the government and SBP to encourage inflows through official channels
as well as limited cross-border travel due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with
favorable foreign exchange market dynamics.

SBP launches complaint resolution portal to promote affordable housing

The Prime Minister of Pakistan chaired a meeting of National Coordination Committee on Housing,
Construction and Development (NCCHCD) in Islamabad today. Governor State Bank, Dr. Reza Baqir,
presented key features of an online complaint resolution mechanism developed by State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) to resolve complaints of potential customers under Government’s Markup Subsidy
Scheme for affordable housing. The Prime Minister appreciated the development of a user friendly and
comprehensive complaint resolution mechanism to assist common persons who would like to borrow
under this Scheme. The complaint resolution mechanism comprises an IT based portal supported by a
comprehensive network of State Bank and commercial bank staff to take care of problems faced by
applicants of low cost and affordable housing finance. The IT portal has been made live for registration
of complaints. This major initiative will help financially excluded low and middle-income segments who
often find it difficult to access the formal financial sector, which is a key goal of the SBP. The system
will help in resolving complaints within a predefined timeline with proper escalation mechanism.

The potential customers can already access existing systems and procedures of banks for resolution of
their complaints. The complaint resolution mechanism developed by State Bank is a move to improve
effectiveness and transparency in complaint redressal process.

In line with Government's vision of making housing finance affordable, State Bank has, on October 12,
2020, issued Government’s Mark-up Subsidy for Housing Finance to facilitate provision of subsidized
finance to low and middle-income individuals. The features of Markup Subsidy Facility can be seen at
https://www.sbp.org.pk/smefd/circulars/2020/C11.htm.

 

The State Bank is making efforts with the support of banking industry to ensure that the benefits of the
markup subsidy scheme reaches targeted customers of banks who currently do not own a house. On
the advice of State Bank of Pakistan, the banks have designated around 50% of their branches for
provision of financing under this facility. With this, more than 7,700 branches of banks across the
country have been designated to process financing of approaching customers under this scheme, while
rest of the branches in the network will act as referral points for the designated branches.

With the launch of portal, customers can now register their concerns by simply putting minimum details
on the online service portal accessible at https://servicedesk.sbp.org.pk/. A short video is also available
on this portal to explain how complaints may be lodged and followed up. In case applicants face
difficulties in using this portal or need further clarification they are welcome to visit the offices of SBP
BSC in 15 major cities where special Help Desks are available to guide and assist, list of offices is
available at https://www.sbp.org.pk/sbp bsc/FieldOff.asp. In order to facilitate resolution of
complaints received under the Markup Subsidy Service Portal, State Bank has created a network of
regional focal persons in State Bank BSC regional offices. The banks have also nominated their regional
focal persons across the regions in the country where State Bank offices are present.

PM Launches Raast: Pakistan’s Instant Payment System — an initiative of SBP
The Honorable Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Imran Khan, launched the completion of the first phase
of Pakistan’s Instant Payment System, Raast, in a ceremony held in Islamabad today and hosted by the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Raast is an initiative of SBP under which it has developed Pakistan’s first
instant payment system in collaboration with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Karandaaz, Pakistan.
Raast is an accomplishment of one of the milestones of SBP’s broader strategic agenda of digitalization
and increasing financial inclusion in the country.
Speaking at the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated SBP and termed the launch of Raast as an
important step towards fulfilling the Government’s vision and commitment to effectively promote and
encourage digitalization of the economy. Raast will provide digital, easy-to-use, efficient and cost-
effective payment options to people of Pakistan and expected to be a catalyst for providing sustainable
opportunities to small businesses and individuals. The Prime Minister showed optimism that Raast will
help government resolve current inefficiencies in various types of payments such as salary and pension
and further improve disbursements under Ehsaas Program and BISPs, amongst other areas.
In his welcoming remarks, Dr. Reza Baqir informed that the Central Bank has been encouraging
technological innovations in banking and payment systems for a long time; however, following the
vision of the PM and his support it has stepped up its efforts further to accelerate the pace of
digitalization in the country. To modernize country’s banking and payment systems, SBP has taken
various initiatives such as enabling Fintechs, and modernizing payments’ infrastructure.
Referring to the National Payments Strategy prepared with the help of World Bank and announced in
November 2019, Governor Bagir remarked that Raast is the first major step taken to implement the
strategy. He highlighted that SBP initiated the project Raast, with the support of Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and Karandaaz Pakistan, after a thorough review of ground realities about prevailing
payment habits and in line with international best practices and standards. The state-of-the-art faster
payment system will provide a cheap and universal access to people of Pakistan especially those who
are financially excluded and less privileged like women.
Dr Baqir told the gathering that the faster payment system will help spur economic growth especially
by facilitating small businesses and individuals. He shared SBP’s plan to launch the system in a phased
manner, starting with bulk payment module which will include digitization of dividend payments,
salaries, pensions and other payments of government departments. In next phases, Raast will digitize
payments of micro and small business owners or merchants, who can then pay suppliers on time and
fulfill other urgent payment obligations. Similarly, the system will provide seamless Person-to-Person
payments that will include features such as sending requests for payments and initiating payments
using identifiers such as phone numbers or any other alias.
The UN Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA), H.M
Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, also graced the occasion and shared her thoughts. The Special
Advocate has supported promoting financial inclusion in Pakistan over the years, including
country visits in 2016 and 2019. Pakistan launched its first national financial inclusion strategy
(NFIS) shortly before the UNSGSA’s first visit. During her UN country visit in November 2019,
the UNSGSA delivered a speech at a ceremony to establish the micropayments gateway now
being launched as Raast — Pakistan’s Instant Payment System.

SBP releases First Quarterly Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy

The State Bank of Pakistan released its First Quarterly Report on The State of Pakistan’s Economy for
the fiscal year 2020-21 today covering the period July — September, 2020.

The report finds that there were encouraging indications during Q1-FY21 that Pakistan’s economy was
regaining its pre-Covid trajectory. The recovery in economic activities was evident across the
agriculture, industry, and services sectors. Importantly, external and fiscal sector indicators also
remained favorable, indicating that the emerging recovery was being achieved while keeping
macroeconomic stability intact. The report notes that a timely and well-calibrated economic policy
response to the Covid crisis from the government and the SBP helped to prevent a deeper fallout from
the crisis and lay the foundations for economic recovery.

Specifically, in the external sector, the current account posted a surplus, primarily due to robust
workers’ remittances, rebound in exports, and lower services imports. Continued policy measures
under the Pakistan Remittance Initiative and the promotion of formal and digital channels played a
major role in driving remittances up. The Covid-related international air travel restrictions also helped
divert remittances from informal to formal channels, while dampening the level of Pakistan’s services
imports at the same time. Import payments were relatively lower during the first quarter compared to
last year due to a sharp fall in global oil prices. Meanwhile, export receipts recovered from the lows in
last quarter of the last fiscal year but were somewhat lower compared to the Q1-FY20, with demand
remaining soft among key trading partners. Nonetheless, Pakistan’s export performance was relatively
better compared to a number of other emerging markets, partly due to the early resumption of
economic activity. As a result, exports regained their pre-Covid trajectory in September, helped by
higher export receipts for textiles, cement and pharmaceuticals.

On the whole, the current account surplus provided a further boost to the country’s FX reserves and
strengthened the exchange rate during the quarter. The important shock-absorbing quality of the
market-determined exchange rate was also evident during the quarter, as the PKR adjusted flexibly in
both directions in line with underlying external sector fundamentals and flows.

It is worth highlighting that the national effort to mitigate the fallout of the pandemic, in the form of
timely and calibrated policy interventions of the government and the SBP, provided a conducive
environment for economic recovery to take root. Specifically, the fiscal and monetary policies in place
represented an accommodative policy environment compared to the demand compression focus a
year earlier amid high inflation and twin fiscal and current account deficits. This shift was instrumental
in facilitating economic activity following the easing of domestic lockdowns to contain the first wave of
Covid.

Within industry, the report highlights notable growth in cement and food processing sectors, as well as
a revival in the automobile sector. Demand indicators such as cement dispatches, POL and car sales,
power generation, consumer financing, and fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) sales showed a
corresponding uptick. In line with the growth in LSM, there was also growth in employment reflected,
inter alia, in the July-August 2020 monthly surveys of industrial employment compiled by the statistical
bureaus of Punjab and Sindh. These encouraging developments were also reflected in the SBP’s
Business Confidence Survey of August, with the business community’s sentiments turning positive for
the first time since February 2020.

State Bank of Pakistan voted as the best central bank for promoting Islamic finance

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been voted as the Best Central Bank in promoting Islamic
finance for the fourth time by a poll conducted by Islamic Finance News (IFN), REDmoney
Group Malaysia, today. This is the second international award bestowed upon SBP for Islamic
Banking during FY2021. Earlier the Global Islamic Finance Awards (GIFA) has also declared SBP
as the Best Central Bank of the year in September 2020.

IFN while announcing the poll results stated, “It is always a closely contested battle for the top
spot, but 2020 was rather more of a runaway victory than we have seen in recent years. The
2018 winner, the State Bank of Pakistan, achieved a decisive win with almost three quarters of
the votes.” It was further stated by IFN that this year despite global pandemic, they have
received the highest number of votes for the poll in its 16 years history.

The Islamic banking sector in Pakistan continued strong growth momentum during 2020 and its
share in the overall banking industry’s assets and deposits stood at 16.0 percent and 17.3
percent respectively with a network of 3,303 branches in 122 districts across the country as of
September 2020.

Increasing financial inclusion by providing an enabling environment and promoting Islamic
banking in the country is an important component of SBP’s strategy. Further, Islamic banking
has been made an integral part of National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) of Government of
Pakistan to serve those who prefer Islamic products or who are voluntarily excluded or
underserved due to their religious belief. Under the enhanced NFIS 2023, market share of the
Islamic banking in the overall banking industry has been targeted at 25%.

State Bank of Pakistan has always shown its resolve and commitment towards building sound
foundations for sustainable growth of the Islamic banking industry in the country. With
particular reference to the testing times of last year, in the backdrop of COVID-19, SBP has
issued three major Shariah compliant Islamic refinance schemes. These include Islamic
refinance scheme for payment of wages and salaries to the workers and employees of business
concerns (Rozgar Scheme), Islamic Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and Islamic
Refinance Facility for Combating Covid-19 (IRFCC). These refinance schemes helped faith
sensitive clientele to take advantage of facilities offered by SBP that aimed at combating the
adverse effects of the pandemic. Another landmark initiative of SBP is launch of Shariah
compliant Islamic Naya Pakistan Certificates under Roshan Digital Account for overseas
Pakistanis. Recently, SBP has also issued guidelines for Development Finance Institutions to
undertake Shariah compliant business.

Achieving four IFN awards of the best central bank since 2015 in addition to other international
accolades is the reflection of global recognition of the strategic measures that SBP is
undertaking to foster sustainable growth of Islamic banking in Pakistan.

Monetary Policy Statement
January 22, 2021

1. At its meeting on 224 January 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the
policy rate at 7 percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in November, the domestic recovery has
gained some further traction. Most economic activity data and indicators of consumer and business sentiment
have shown continued improvement. As a result, there are upside risks to the current growth projection of
slightly above 2 percent in FY21. On the inflation front, recent out-turns are also encouraging, suggesting a
waning of supply-side price pressures from food and still-benign core inflation. While utility tariff increases
may cause an uptick in inflation, this is likely to be transient given excess capacity in the economy and well-
anchored inflation expectations. As a result, inflation is still expected to fall within the previously announced
range of 7-9 percent for FY21 and trend toward the 5-7 percent target range over the medium-term. With the
inflation outlook relatively benign aside from the possibility of temporary supply-side shocks, the MPC felt
that the existing accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to support the nascent
recovery while keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability.

2. While noting these favorable growth and inflation developments, the MPC also stressed that considerable
uncertainty remains around the outlook. The trajectory of the Covid pandemic is difficult to predict, given
still-elevated global cases, the emergence of new strains, and lingering uncertainties about the roll-out of
vaccines worldwide. Such external shocks could slow the recovery. In light of such Covid-related
uncertainties, the MPC considered it appropriate to provide some forward guidance on monetary policy to
facilitate policy predictability and decision-making by economic agents. In the absence of unforeseen
developments, the MPC expects monetaty policy settings to remain unchanged in the near term. As the
recovery becomes more durable and the economy returns to full capacity, the MPC expects any adjustments
in the policy rate to be measured and gradual to achieve mildly positive real interest rates.

3. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal
sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation.

Real sector

4. The economic recovery underway since July has strengthened in recent months. Large-scale
manufacturing (LSM) grew by 7.4 percent (y/y) in October and 14.5 percent (y/y) in November. The
manufacturing recovery is also becoming more broad-based, with 12 out of 15 subsectors registering positive
growth in November and employment beginning to recover. So far this fiscal year, LSM has grown by 7.4
percent (y/y), against a contraction of 5.3 percent during the same period last year. Nevertheless, the level of
manufacturing activity generally remained below average levels in FY19, pointing to continued spare capacity
in the economy. On the demand side, cement sales remain strong on the back of rising construction activity,
POL sales are at two-year highs, and automobile sales are also rising in both urban (motorcars) and rural
(tractors) markets. In agriculture, cotton output is likely to decline more than expected based on latest
production estimates. However, this is likely to be offset by improved growth in other major crops and higher
wheat production due to the rise in support prices along with announced subsidies on fertilizers and
pesticides for Rabi crops. While social distancing is still affecting some service sectors, wholesale, retail trade
and transportation are expected to benefit from improvements in construction and manufacturing activity.

Governor SBP steers the third Stakeholders Meeting on Digital Financial Services

 

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) organized the third nationwide Stakeholders’ meeting on Digital
Financial Services today chaired by Governor SBP, Dr. Reza Baqir. The goal of these meetings has been
to accelerate the agenda on promoting digital financial services and payments in Pakistan. The meeting
was attended by the Country Director World Bank; Secretary MOITT; Accountant General of Pakistan
Revenue (AGPR); Secretary BISP; representatives from NADRA, PTA, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
(BMGF), Karandaaz; and, CEOs/Presidents of Banks, Telcos and Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs),
and several other stakeholders.

Governor Baqir briefed the forum about the significant progress made since the last stakeholder’s
consultative meeting and the important steps taken by SBP to facilitate digital payments. He said that
the development of Pakistan’s Instant Payments System project powered by SBP in collaboration with
its partners has progressed significantly and the Prime Minister of Pakistan will soon launch the
completion of its first phase. This phase will enable instant transfer of dividend payments directly into
the bank accounts of investors by Central Depository Company (CDC). Governor Baqir remarked that
the completion of this phase in a reasonable time despite disruptions due to Covid19 is commendable
and SBP appreciated the continuous support of its partners and other stakeholders. He also highlighted
that various other initiatives accelerating the pace of digitization in the country. He said the successful
introduction of digital account opening and provision of lifestyle banking and investments by banks
through the Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) for Non-resident Pakistanis is a giant step forward. Adding
further, he said that SBP has also fast tracked the licensing application process for EMls which will help
to accelerate digital payments by the non-bank players. To facilitate cross-border flows of retail
payments and venture capital funds SBP has also made amendments in the Foreign Exchange manual
to make it easier to make payments, he said.

Governor SBP thanked the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their local representative Karandaaz
Pakistan, SBP’s implementation partner, McKinsey Pakistan, and technology partner CMA who
provided their full support despite challenges of the Covid, travel ban and others to accelerate work on
Pakistan’s instant payments system. Governor Baqir also appreciated the AGPR for their interest in
leveraging the instant payment system platform for Salaries and Pension disbursements and BISP for
their interest in routing Ehsaas Program payments via this platform.

During the meeting, SBP also shared its plans for ensuring affordable access to digital financial services
for discussion. In this regard, SBP apprised the stakeholders on the progress made in finalizing the
charges for digital channels such as Inter Bank Funds Transfers (IBFT). Suggestions and feedback were
sought from the participants who largely appreciated the efforts of SBP catalyzing the spread of digital

financial services in the country, which is beneficial for both the financial institutions and public.
