Disclosure of Inside Information by listed company in terms of Section 15D(1)

“During the period ended September 30, 2019 Samin Textiles Limited (""the Company"") has incurred net profit
amounting to Rs. 15.383 million. In September 2018, the operations of the mill were s spended. Later on,

in an EOGM held on 26 October, 2018 and an alternate business plan for trading, import and export of textile
products was adopted.

 

The above mentioned alternate business plan became unviable due to imposition of additional taxes on textile
sector and subsequently could not be implemented. It is not possible to run the Company at an economically
viable level due to poor economic / market conditions for textile sector and high energy costs.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, the Company is not considered a going concern. These financial statements have
been prepared using the non-going concern basis of accounting on the basis of estimated realizable / settlement
values of the assets and liabilities respectively.”

Material Information
Dear Sir,

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in its latest inspection of the Bank, identified a shortfall in
collateral against certain financial facilities granted by the Bank. In compliance with the SBP
requirements, the Bank has obtained additional collateral, equivalent to identified shortfall,
details of which have been provided to SBP. SBP has required the Bank to assess the value of
the additional collateral obtained. In order to fulfill the valuation requirement, SBP has further
given the option to delay the quarterly financial statements, as of September 30, 2019, of the
Bank, till the conclusion of the said valuation process so that the financial statements reflect
the full impact of additional collateral obtained. The Bank has therefore sought time from SBP,
till December 15, 2019, for the conclusion of the evaluation process and publishing of the
quarterly financial statements, as of September 30, 2019, of the Bank.

The 170"" meeting of the Board of Directors being in session on October 30, 2019, for review
and approval of third quarterly accounts for the period ended September 30, 2019, has
therefore, been concluded accordingly.

You may please inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly.

Yours truly,

PRL

by the Board of Directors after satisfactory conclusion of the FEED and project's financial close. Based on
the above factors and their expected positive impact on the Company's projections together with the
support of its parent and continuous availability of financing facilities, the Company believes that it will
meet the obligations and continue to operate for a period of at least twelve months from the date of
approval of these financial statements. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared ona
going concern basis and therefore, do not include any adjustments to the carrying amount and
classification of assets and liabilities that may arise if the Company was unable to continue as a going

concern.

B. EXTRACTS FROM THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS ON AUDIT OF THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019

The external auditors have included following paragraph of material uncertainty relating to going
concern in their audit report:

We draw attention to note 3.1.2 to the financial statements. As stated in the note, as at June 30, 2019
the Company has accumulated loss of Rs. 10.67 billion. Further, current liabilities of the Company
exceed its current assets by Rs. 10.89 billion. These conditions, indicate the existence of a material
uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

C. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING & BOOK CLOSURE

The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on Tuesday, October 22, 2019 at 10:00 am at
Karachi. The Share Transfer Books of the Company will remain closed from Wednesday, October 16,
2019 to Tuesday, October 22, 2019 (both days inclusive) when no applications for transfer of shares will
be accepted.

Subject: DISCOVERY OF OIL AND GAS AT CHANDA WELL # 05
Dear Sir,

By the grace of Almighty Allah, the joint venture of chanda D&PL Comprising Oil & Gas
Development Company Limited (OGDCL) as operator with 72%, Government Holdings (Private)
Limited (GHPL) with 17.5% & Zaver Petroleum Corporation (Private) Limited (ZPCL) with 10.5%
have discovered crude oil and gas from its development Well 05, which is located in district
Kohat, Khyber Pakhtoon Khwa Province. This is the first discovery of crude oil & gas from
“Wargal Formation” in chanda oil field.

és The structure of chanda will # 05 was drilled and tested using OGDCL’s in house
expertise. The well was drilled down to the depth of 5440 meters. The well has been tested 76
BPD crude oil & 0.512 Million Standard Cube Feet per Day (MMSCFD) gas through choke size
32/64” at well head flowing pressure 89-149 Psi from Wargal formation.

3: The discovery of chanda well # 05 is the result of aggressive exploration strategy
adopted by the company. It has opened a new avenue in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area for
exploration of deeper prospects for other E&P companies operating in the area. This discovery
of oil & gas at deeper prospects would certainly add to the hydrocarbon reserves base of
OGDCL and of the Country.

4. The above information is submitted in compliance with Clause 5.19.13(c) of Code of

14, REGISTRATION WITH FEDERAL BOARD OF REVENUE

 

 

The Federal Board of Revenue has initiated a drive to widen the tax net of the country. It is
essential for the success of this effort that large tax payers facilitate FBR in this respect.
Therefore, all shareholders who are not already registered with FBR are requested to get
themselves registered, wherever applicable.

15. MERGER OF DIFFERENT FOLIOS INTO ONE FOLIO

As per record, some of the shareholders are maintaining more than one folio under the same
particulars. Carrying two different folios may be a hassle for the shareholders to reconcile
and receive different benefits in the shape of dividends/bonus. In order to provide better
services and convenience, such shareholders are requested to send requests to the
Company’s Share Registrar and Transfer agent to merge their folios into one folio.

14, REGISTRATION WITH FEDERAL BOARD OF REVENUE

 

 

The Federal Board of Revenue has initiated a drive to widen the tax net of the country. It is
essential for the success of this effort that large tax payers facilitate FBR in this respect.
Therefore, all shareholders who are not already registered with FBR are requested to get
themselves registered, wherever applicable.

15. MERGER OF DIFFERENT FOLIOS INTO ONE FOLIO

As per record, some of the shareholders are maintaining more than one folio under the same
particulars. Carrying two different folios may be a hassle for the shareholders to reconcile
and receive different benefits in the shape of dividends/bonus. In order to provide better
services and convenience, such shareholders are requested to send requests to the
Company’s Share Registrar and Transfer agent to merge their folios into one folio.

(

i) Pursuant to the provisions of the Finance Act, 2019 effective July 1, 2019, the rates of deduction of >)
income tax from dividend payments under Section 150 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 have been
revised as follows:

1. For active tax payer 15%
2. For non-active tax payer 30%

To enable the Company to make tax deduction on the amount of cash dividend @ 15% instead of 30%,
shareholders whose names are not entered into the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) provided on the website
of FBR, despite the fact that they are filers, are advised to make sure that their names are entered in ATL
before the first day of book closure, otherwise tax on their cash dividend will be deducted @ 30% instead
of 15%.

(ii) Withholding Tax exemption from the dividend income, shall only be allowed if copy of valid tax
exemption certificate or stay order from a competent court of law is made available to FAMCO Associates
(Private) Limited, by the first day of Book Closure.

(iii) Further, according to clarification received from Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), with-holding tax will
be determined separately on ‘Filer/Non-Filer’ status of Principal shareholder as well as joint-holder(s)
based on their shareholding proportions, in case of joint accounts.

In this regard all shareholders who hold shares jointly are requested to provide shareholding proportions of
Principal shareholder and Joint-holder(s) in respect of shares held by them (only if not already provided) to
our Shares Registrar, in writing as follows:

Shareholding | Name and | Shareholding

Name and | Proportion Proportion
Shares CNIC #_|(No. of Shares) (No. of Shares)

 

 

The required information must reach our Shares Registrar within 10 days of this notice; otherwise it will be
assumed that the shares are equally held by Principal shareholder and Joint Holder(s).

folio numbers. Without the NTN company would not be in a position to check filer status on the ATL and
hence higher tax of 30% may be applied in such cases.

registered address of the Company 10 days before holding of the Annual General Meeting. If the Company

Subject: Placement of the Company in the Defaulter’s Segment
Dear Sir

This is with reference to your letter No. PSX/Gen-3830 dated August 30, 2019.

As the Land, Building and Plant & machinery etc. of the Company have already been disposed
off to pay back the loans from financial institutions in pursuance to the Special Resolution
approved by the shareholders in a General Meeting, so the Company started pursuing other

avenues of business.

The company received a proposal for merger with M/s Sufi Steel Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. but
unfortunately, the economic conditions and the stock market situation got aggravated and the
party is presently hesitant to go for merger under these circumstances and have postponed the

negotiations till the country’s economic condition and stock market improves.

In case of any further update, we shall inform the Exchange accordingly.

Subject: Material Information

Dear Sir,

In accordance with Section 96 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) of the Regulations
of Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited (""PSX""), we hereby convey the following information:-

Further to our letter dated February 18, 2019 (copy attached), inter alia informing PSX that the
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (""SECP"") had accorded its approval for
conversion of Golden Arrow Selected Stocks Fund Limited into an Open End Scheme from the
Effective Date to be not later than July 1, 2019 as per the SECP's approval letter dated February
14, 2019.

We are now pleased to informed you that the final Trust Deed has been executed by AKD
Investment Management Limited, the Management Company and Central Depository Company
of Pakistan Limited, the Trustee on June 25, 2019, which was submitted to the Sub-Registrar on
the same day for registration and the Sub-Registrar has accepted the Trust Deed for registration.

According to Condition No.1 of the SECP’s letter dated February 14, 2019, the Effective Date for
conversion of GASSFL into an Open End Scheme was supposed to be not later than July 1, 2019.
Unfortunately, due to time involved in finalization and execution of the Trust Deed and other
formalities required to be fulfilled, including preparation of Offering Document (which is
currently under Trustee's review), it will not be possible to complete the conversion process by
July 1, 2019, as specified in the Condition No.1 of SECP's letter dated February 14, 2019.
Therefore, we have requested the SECP to extend the Effective Date of conversion from July 1,
2019 to October 1, 2019, in the public interest while providing the Management Company of the
Fund to amicably ensure seamless transition into an Open-end Collective Investment Scheme.

A Disclosure Form is enclosed herewith (Annexure ""A"")
You may please inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly.

Yours truly,

‘Non-Active’ status of shareholders shall be @ 15% and 30% respectively. Where ‘Active’ means a person whose name
appears on the Active Taxpayers List available at e-portal of FBR (http:/Avww.fbr.gov.pk/) and ‘Non-Active’ means a
person whose name is not being appeared on the Active Taxpayers List.
Furthermore, according to clarification provided by the FBR; in case a Folio/CDS Account is jointly held, each joint-hold-
er is to be treated separately as Active or Non-Active. In terms of the said clarification, tax of each joint-holder has been
deducted on the gross dividend amount determined by bifurcating the shareholding of each joint-holder on equal
proportions, except where shareholding proportion of joint-holder(s) is pre-defined as per the records of the Company's
Share Registrar and thus tax rates are applied in line with respective proportions.
Those shareholders who are holding Folio/CDS jointly; are requested to notify (in writing) any change in their sharehold-
ing proportions to Company's Share Registrar (in case of physical shareholding) or their Participants/CDC Investor
Account Services so that their revised shareholding proportions are considered by the Company in all prospective
dividend payouts of the Company, if any.
Exemption from Deduction of Income Tax
As per FBR Circulars C. No.1 (29) WHT/2006 dated 30 June 2010 and C. No.1 (43) DG (WHT)/2008-Vol. II -66417-R.
dated 12 May 2015, the valid exemption certificate is mandatory to claim exemption of withholding tax U/S 150 of the
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (tax on dividend amount) where the statutory exemption under clause 47B of Part -IV of
Second Schedule is available. The shareholders who fall in the category mentioned in above clause and want to avail
exemption U/S 150 of the Ordinance, must provide valid Tax Exemption Certificate to our Share Registrar before book
closure otherwise tax will be deducted on dividend as per applicable rates.
Unclaimed Dividend
As per the provisions of section 244 of the Companies Act, 2017, any shares issued or dividend declared by the
Company which have remained unclaimed/unpaid for a period of three years from the date on which it was due and
payable, are required to be deposited with Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for the credit of Federal

achieved within a six-month time frame, after which it is intended to re commence commercial

production of Jute goods, to the extent that it is viable.

As we have submitted earlier, any precipitate action would be to the detriment of the shareholders
and it is requested that a one year time frame be given to us to ensure active compliance of the PSX
regulations.We shall be pleased to provide you with periodic progress reports of the process to

resume commercial production ,

As you are aware, the Company has not generated any funds since the shutdown of its production
facilities and the entire funding required to sustain the company and keep it in existence, has been
borne by its principal shareholder. Moreover, the Company has obligations to financial institutions
and It has to first clear these outstanding dues once funds are generated from a resumption of

Subject: Material Information

Dear Sir,

This is to inform shareholders that GSK has been contacted by regulatory authorities regarding the
detection of genotoxic nitrosamine NDMA in ranitidine products and responding to their queries.

Based on the information received and correspondence with regulatory authorities, GSK made the
decision to suspend the release, distribution and supply of all dose forms of ranitidine hydrochloride
products to all markets, including Pakistan, as a precautionary action pending the outcome of ongoing
tests and investigations.

GSK Pakistan has proactively informed the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) about the
above decision. Subsequently, the DRAP, vide notice dated 23 September 2019, has advised Pharma
Companies to recall all ranitidine-containing products in the market till further orders.

In order to comply with DRAP’s instructions, GSK Pakistan is recalling all dose forms of Zantac from
Distributors and Pharmacies.

GSK is continuing with investigations into the potential source of the NDMA. These investigations
include continued engagement with our API suppliers. Patient safety remains our utmost priority and
we are taking this issue very seriously.

Yours sincerely,

err

Ref: PSX/Gen-3830 dated August 30, 2019
Dear Sir,

We refer your above letter, wherein you had favourably considered our request that trading in shares of
the company may not be suspended, while keeping it in the defaulter counter in lieu of the merger of the
company with Crescent Star Foods (Pvt.) Limited (CSF), (PICIC will be the surviving entity) with
direction to keep the exchange updated on monthly basis on the progress on the merger proceedings in
the High Court. As such the monthly update as directed in your letter dated August 30, 2019 is as
follows:

The merger petition hearing is in advanced stage of hearing before The Sind High Court. It was fixed
today that is September 26, 2019 and the matter was part heard and is now fixed on October 17, 2019.
Since the petition is part heard, it is expected that the decision for approval of the merger will be given
soon. We will once again update PSX after the October 17 hearing.

The scheme of merger has already been announced to PSX wherein the company would be doing
FMCG business. CSF is already a franchisee of FAT BURGER AND BUFFOLO EXPRESS and
BOMBAY CHOWPATTY which will be transferred to the company by virtue of merger with CSF.
Besides the FMCG business the company has other investment/trading plans which would be
announced after the merger.

Keeping the interests of all stakeholders, we request you to maintain the current status of the company

on PSX and not suspend the trading of the company’s shares. We request you to withdraw the notice
dated September 23, 2019 and also forwarded to us with your letter Ref. No. PSX/Gen 4698 dated

¢) in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given
to us, the balance sheet, profit and loss account, statement of comprehensive income,
cash flow statement and statement of changes in equity together with the notes forming
part thereof conform with approved accounting standards as applicable in Pakistan, and,
give the information required by the Modaraba Companies and Modaraba (Floatation and
Control) Ordinance, 1980 (XXXI of 1980) and the Modaraba Companies and Mocaraba
Rules, 1981, in the manner so required and respectively give a true and fair view of the
state of the Modaraba’s affairs as at June 30, 2019 and of the loss, comprehensive loss,
its cash flows and changes in equity for the year then ended: and

@) no Zakat was deductible at source under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance, 1980 (XVIII of
1980).

We draw attention to Note 1.2 of the accompanied financial statements, which indicates that the
Modaraba incurred a net loss of Rs. 35.716 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. As of
that date the Modaraba’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by Rs. 109.010 million, its
net llabilities amounted to Rs. 22.110 million and its accumulated losses amounted to Rs.
316.065 million. Moreover, National Bank of Pakistan’s plan to recapitalize the Modaraba by
injecting further Rs. 300 million is awaiting approval from the State Bank of Pakistan. This
situation indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the
Modaraba’s ability to continue as going concern, Therefore, these financial statements have been
prepareci on the basis of estimated realizable / settlement vaiues of assets and liabilities
respectively, Estimated realizable / settlement values are based on the management's best
estimate. Estimation involves judgment based on the latest available, reliable information,
historical experience and other factors, including expectation of future ewents that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. In future, these estimates may need revision if
changes occur In the circumstances on which the estimates are based or as a result af new
information. Hence, the ultimate values at which assets will be realized and liabilities will be
settled may be different from those carried in these financial statemerts. Our opinion fs not
qualified In respect of this matter.

In the last 1 year, interests rates have increased by over 77% (6 Month KIBOR 7.81% (August 29,
2018), 13.83% (as on August 29, 2019). At the same time, rupee has lost its value by over 26%
during the same period and today stands at PKR 157 to 1 USD. This has resulted in extreme
slowing down in demand which has slowed-down the whole economy. This, in turn, has resulted
in liquidity drying out for the private sector as banks now have an option to lend to the
Government (risk free) at around 14%.

All of this has adversely impacted the business plan for our Company (as presented to the
Commission on November 12, 2018). This has compelled the board to review the whole business
plan and it has now decided that the earlier business plan is no more viable/profitable and
therefore has decided to scrap the same. In view of this, the Company has also decided not to
purchase the 154 acre land.

The board has now decided to cut down the size of the total business plan from PKR 20 billion to
around PKR 2 billion (exact figure and source of funds to be finalized once the business plan is
complete) where, now, the Company looks to enter into processing and production of by-
products of edible oil. The Company may also be producing chemicals including calcium salts that
can be sold locally as well as can be exported.

The Company is negotiating with parties for the purchase of related plant and equipment at this
point in time.

The management of AAL is engaged in finalizing a new business plan in light of the above
mentioned realities and hope to have the same ready in next couple of months. Once this is done,
we will request an audience with the PSX to present the new business plan. Meanwhile, we will
keep the Exchange up to date with developments in this regard.

Please also note that we had also approached CDC for induction of shares in its Central
Depository System. However, we were told that the process of induction of shares will be
initiated only after suspension in trading is removed.

We further plan to secure approval of shareholders for changes in the object clause and
authorized capital in the upcoming Annual General Meeting scheduled for October 24, 2019.

We greatly appreciate continued understanding and support of the Exchange in this regard.

In the last 1 year, interests rates have increased by over 77% (6 Month KIBOR 7.81% (August 29,
2018), 13.83% (as on August 29, 2019). At the same time, rupee has lost its value by over 26%
during the same period and today stands at PKR 157 to 1 USD. This has resulted in extreme
slowing down in demand which has slowed-down the whole economy. This, in turn, has resulted
in liquidity drying out for the private sector as banks now have an option to lend to the
Government (risk free) at around 14%.

All of this has adversely impacted the business plan for our Company (as presented to the
Commission on November 12, 2018). This has compelled the board to review the whole business
plan and it has now decided that the earlier business plan is no more viable/profitable and
therefore has decided to scrap the same. In view of this, the Company has also decided not to
purchase the 154 acre land.

The board has now decided to cut down the size of the total business plan from PKR 20 billion to
around PKR 2 billion (exact figure and source of funds to be finalized once the business plan is
complete) where, now, the Company looks to enter into processing and production of by-
products of edible oil. The Company may also be producing chemicals including calcium salts that
can be sold locally as well as can be exported.

The Company is negotiating with parties for the purchase of related plant and equipment at this
point in time.

The management of AAL is engaged in finalizing a new business plan in light of the above
mentioned realities and hope to have the same ready in next couple of months. Once this is done,
we will request an audience with the PSX to present the new business plan. Meanwhile, we will
keep the Exchange up to date with developments in this regard.

Please also note that we had also approached CDC for induction of shares in its Central
Depository System. However, we were told that the process of induction of shares will be
initiated only after suspension in trading is removed.

We further plan to secure approval of shareholders for changes in the object clause and
authorized capital in the upcoming Annual General Meeting scheduled for October 24, 2019.

We greatly appreciate continued understanding and support of the Exchange in this regard.

¢) as stated in note 27.1 to the financial statements, the Company has investment in
preference shares (""shares"") of AGL, with cost of Rs. 5.25 per share, designated as fair
value through other comprehensive income, and National Bank of Pakistan has agreed
to repurchase these shares at Rs. 5.25 per share at a future date and subject to
conditions as defined in the put option agreement. As per the latest available financial
statements of AGL, it is in financial difficulties, is not able to timely service its long term
debts and its equity has completely eroded. Intemational Financial Reporting Standard
on Financial Instruments: (IFRS 9) requires the investments classified as fair value through
OCI to be re-measured, at market rate prevailing as at the reporting date, with the
resultant gain or loss to be recognized in statement of comprehensive income and to
account for the derivative at fair value. However, the Company has not complied with
the requirements of IFRS 9 and has measured the investment and the derivative at the
option price. We are unable to determine the respective fair values of the investment in
preference shares and the derivative by alternative means, and consequently were
unable to determine the amount of adjustments required; and

d) as stated in note 21.2.2 to the financial statements that on December 18, 2014, the
Court of Vicenza, Italian Republic (‘the Court"") approved bankruptcy proposal of
public prosecutor and appointed Trustee to manage the affairs of the wholly owned
subsidiary, Montebello s.rl. (""MBL""). The Company has recorded impairment
aggregating to Rs. 2,652.03 million against its investment in MBL and Rs. 452.53 million
against the trade receivables from MBL. The management has represented through its
legal counsel that the MBL bankruptcy is currently in process with Italian Bankruptcy
court and its appointed liquidator and accordingly the assets of MBL are being realized
for satisfaction of the claims filed against MBL. In view of the absence of definite
determination of the claims / recoveries expected by the Company, we are unable to
satisfy ourselves as to the appropriateness of the amounts recorded and related
disclosures made in the financial statement by the Company.

Except as stated in (a) to (d) above, we conducted our audit in accordance with Intemational
Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our responsibilities under those standards
are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (the Code) and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
qualified opinion.

Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern

We draw attention to note 2.3 to the financial statements which describes that during the year
the current liabilities of the Company have exceeded its current assets by Rs. 12,263.61 million,
and its accumulated losses stand at Rs. 11,470.42 million. These conditions, along with other
matters as set forth in note 2.3 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. The management of the Company have assessed its ability to continue as going
concern taking into consideration the improvement in results generated from operating
activities and expected impact of ongoing financial restructuring. Our opinion is not qualified in
respect of this matter.
